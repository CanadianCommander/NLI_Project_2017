# Natural Language Identification Project 2017
The purpose of this project is to read essays written by english as a second
language students and determine there primary language. To achieve this goal
we will employ the machine learning techniques outlined in this article
[Mark Dras et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06541.pdf). In summery we will
employ SVM, LDA and various other techniques in a synthesis mechanism know as
Classifier Ensembles. By using the Ensemble technique we hope to greatly improve
the accuracy of our predictions.
