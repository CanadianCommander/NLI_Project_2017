When I left my home, the most and I missed is my parents um because I have to take care of take take care of myself by myself and then don't have the care of theirs. And second I miss missed the spicy food in my hometown like the pink tofu and the spicy food is a symbol of our country and of our province. Um and the third thing is my old friends, they are so kind to me and I have to be uh a long time not seeing them. So <%> and and go to shopping without my good friends and that's the three things I missed.
