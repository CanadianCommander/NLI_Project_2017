One of the opportunities that was given to me was to work and travel to the United States. I went to travel last summer to Miami and it was a great opportunity because it gave me the chance to uh improve my English. Um to learn about another culture that I never went before. And basically because it made me choose to involve uh to, to ma- ma- it made it easier for me to talk to people to uh be in touch in a working environment.
