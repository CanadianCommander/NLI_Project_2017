I am working in the banking sector and I have a special opportunity which many people did not have. I have been trained by a special trainer and which is uh who was also my uh adviser uh one by one. And this make me sure of the fact that uh what I will be learning and what I should be asking uh to customers and how I should answer the questions of the customers. And I believe that this made me one step closer compared to my colleagues.
