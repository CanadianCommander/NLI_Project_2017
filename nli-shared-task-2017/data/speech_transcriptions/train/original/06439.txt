A book I read just not long ago is about soprano. I I thought this book was pretty interesting because it talks about the daily situation um but makes you notice how how normal everything is for example notice how it's a critic towards the society and how absurd all th situations you go through everyday or for example now every time we're having dinner and and in a normal conversation comes of I can't stop thinking about situations that remind me of the moment moments in this book.
