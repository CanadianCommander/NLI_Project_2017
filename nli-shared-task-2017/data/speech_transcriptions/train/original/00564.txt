An interesting book that I have read is The Old Man and The Sea of Hemingway. Uh he explains feelings and sensations very well and it's a book it read. So you can be involved in it and therefore I can think about my life because I love sighting and for me the interactions with nature very important. So I would like that my children will read it because they can be uh professionals like me in my hobby, interests, like sailing boats in the sea and the animals in the sea.
