Good afternoon, the topic I have been given to speak about is the interest the interesting book that I have read. The interesting the most interesting book I have read till now is the Sydney Sheldon's The Other Side of Midnight. Here they have expressed about the two uh different type of people living in a ci- in a particular person, two faced people. This book is very interesting and um this book is very interesting and I guess each and everyone of us should uh should read the Sydney Sheldon's book because it is very mysterious and it concerned about murders and um.
