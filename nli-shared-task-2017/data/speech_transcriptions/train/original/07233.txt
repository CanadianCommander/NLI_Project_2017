If friends from other friends another country were going to spend time in my country in Spain, the city I'd like them to visit would be Madrid. I think Madrid combines uh the best museums, the best night life and also the best food. As far as museums are uh well in Spain we can find the Prado, which is the most important museum in in the world. And for the night life, you have too many ambiance, you have uh <%> and and other stuff and for the restaurant, you can find the best Mediterranean food and the best desserts and probably the best chefs.
