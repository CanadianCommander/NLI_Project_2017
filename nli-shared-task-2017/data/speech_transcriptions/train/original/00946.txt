For me if a person uh a person can be said uh a very valuable member of a team if he has a good character. Even if he is good at uh manipulating things and saying good things about people, if he is not cordial or if, if he doesn't have a good manner, mannerism towards each towards others, then he may not be said as a me- valuable member. Another thing is fidelity, he should be true to others. He shouldn't say false things and um lies to his other members of a team.
