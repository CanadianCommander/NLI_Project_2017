I was given the opportunity of uh taking the test of TOEFL in uh in Canada, and uh my sister told me that I could go and join her. So I thought it was much better than uh doing it uh in the North where uh I live. And uh I'm very happy to have um taken this opportunity, because thanks to them I, I enjoy the visiting the coast, and doing uh many different activities with her. And uh and most of her all I'm spending a lot of time with her and doing uh different things in a very beautiful landscape.
