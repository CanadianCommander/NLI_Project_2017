The interesting book that I have read before is the mathematics text book in my form four and form five. Uh I think that book, the textbook is interesting because actually I didn't like mathematics very much before because it is very difficult uh but when I pay my attention to read and devout my concentration on the mathematic textbooks I learnt a lot such as um matrix uh vectors and I really, I think I'm interest in it and therefore it paved the way for me to choose science streams.
