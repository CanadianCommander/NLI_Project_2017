Well what I miss uh the most is member, uh are members of my family because uh family to me is very important, and uh when I'm away uh I really miss them. I'll also miss uh rooms at my house, uh because uh, uh I miss my bedroom the most because it's very comfortable. But uh the thing which I will miss the most will be the memories that I spent uh at, at uh, at home. Because for me memories are very important, and the past of someone really is important uh, uh for you know what uh you will do in the future. And so this are the most thing I will most when.
