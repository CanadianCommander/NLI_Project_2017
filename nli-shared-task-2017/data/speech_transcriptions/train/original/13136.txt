The kind of reading material I enjoy reading in my free time is mostly novels and newspapers. Um I find novels interesting because I uh I'm drawn to big evolving stories and exploring depth of characters that are all able to involve in longer novels where the author is able to unfold a world and characters of it's own. Newspapers I like  to read because it gives me a background on current events in the world and also keeps me up to date about political developments in my own country.
