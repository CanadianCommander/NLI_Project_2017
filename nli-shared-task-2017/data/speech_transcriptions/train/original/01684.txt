Take my friend to Agra which is nearer to Delhi which is the capital city of my country. I'll I would that place because of many reasons, one is Agra has a <%9.2> importance because there are many forts in in Agra. Second thing is the seventh wonder world that is Taj Mahal is there, so I feel that uh all the visitors uh visit, uh visit India to definitely cover that. Um and secondly now Agra is more uh important for it's food specialties, there are lot of uh eatables in Agra which are not found in any other places. Hence I, I want I would definitely take them to Agra because of so many reasons.
