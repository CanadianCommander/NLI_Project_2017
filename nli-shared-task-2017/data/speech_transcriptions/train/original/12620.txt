Well I think what I missed uh the most when I'm away is uh first and foremost my family. As a matter of fact I'm really close to my, both my parents and uh my little sister and my little brothers. And so when I'm away I usually pho- phone them like at least once a day to know what are they doing at home in Paris. And to tell her about today or my week. What am I doing uh back there. And besides uh I missed uh the city of Paris. Uh as I'm living just next.
