Friends were coming uh to my country I would like them to visit Istanbul and I that's why because that's why I think Istanbul is a great city because uh um there are lots of place to see and the culture there lot of um culture places that they can see and if they want to relax they can go to Bosporus and have a coffee or everything. I think it's also because of the climate of the city cause at the winter time it's always snowy and the and the summer is always is always shiny and I think that's what that's the best way to relax.
