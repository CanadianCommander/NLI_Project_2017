The thing that I miss the most when I'm away from home would be, I would be missing my home. I would miss my family and friends. I'd lo- I'd miss the places which I usually go to. There are few things which I do at my house which I cannot do when I go out my house. So these are the things I would miss the most when I am away from my home. Other things I'd uh, I'll be missing when I'm away from home would be my mum's cooking and the fights which I have with my brother.
