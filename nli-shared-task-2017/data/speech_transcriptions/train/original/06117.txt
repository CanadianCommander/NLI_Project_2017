I had the best opportunity in my life last year when I was chosen to go and study for seven months in Scotland at the university of Glasgow as an investment student. It was a great opportunity for me because I'm studying languages, foreign languages so um I needed to go and speak over there for some time. And it was a great chance to meet other people from all over the world and it was what I was wishing to do since I was younger. um I had a brilliant time there I met wonderful people and the place was really nice as well.
