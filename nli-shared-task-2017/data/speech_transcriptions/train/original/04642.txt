Well I, I would like to become a medical doctor uh for many reasons. First uh I have a high strong sense of community, after working as a volunteer not only in the Red Cross but, but also in other institution on developing countries. Uh furthermore, I have a background uh as a paramedic and as a physician <%23.7> in the States. Uh moreover my fa- my high capacity and uh good skills uh working with people uh make me a good uh doctor even in life. Uh finally, I think that there is a need of health care professional and uh, since my father is a doctor, I had been uh.
