I miss a lot of my family and my like dog and there are wonderful friends I mean not just family members there's like friends and I have not got any friends as good as my sister and my dog. And my mother and father great people in the world. I also miss a lot about the climate I come from a place which is very cool and other places really hot in India. So uh the climate is something I have been adapted all through my seventeen years and now I'm going to a new place like totally different for me and I find it difficult to stay. So with family which is just basically relationships with family members and the pet members. And the climate are the two most important things that I miss away from my home, that's it.
