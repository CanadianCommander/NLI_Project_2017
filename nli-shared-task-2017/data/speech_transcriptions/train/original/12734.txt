Actually I have the opportunity to meet lots of uh people from another country and I had lots of friends from other country such as Italy, England or Germany. One of my best friend actually it's Italian. Um when she went when she came to France, she um she visited Paris and also Nice which is my hometown and advised her also to visit uh Marseille and Lyon because France is very very different in every part and every region of the country. So we can visit and then some different things everywhere. But I think Paris for uh tourist is the best destination to go, It's very very good.
