First, I especially like novels because I like to follow history. Uh li- I like to feel what the characters feel, I like to see what they see and I like to imagine what they are uh going through. Uh I love to to getting to the stories and the story book which I can't stop reading. I I'm not able to to for example, read a magazine about a specific topic because I don't get into it and I can't follow uh the history. I I like topics like love topics.
