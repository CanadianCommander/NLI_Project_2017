So I think um the best opportunity that was given to me when, was when I went to Canada. It was like a student exchange so I didn't have to pay anything except my plane ticket. And it was so good because I improve like really in English and, and I met those awful frie- uh those really good friend there, and there were beautiful landscape and it, I mean I would always return there to, to see them and that was the best summer I had the opportunity to have and the.
