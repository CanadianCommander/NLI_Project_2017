Uh usually I uh uh I like to read a novel so when I have a free time uh the reason why I uh read a novels uh is that the novels uh can provide a lot of information and a lot of interesting stories. So uh in reading novels I can uh interact with the readers and I can come from um um their effect that I am assuming in the middle of the story and also the novels can uh can make me relaxed. So that's why I like the novel instead of the reading magazines or poetries.
