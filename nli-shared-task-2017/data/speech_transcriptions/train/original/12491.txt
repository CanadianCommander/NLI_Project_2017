Parents this summer give me the opportunity to go and uh spend two weeks in Spain studying Spanish. And uh I enjoy I enjoyed a lot this time because it made me uh meet new person of my age even <%>. And also it was a kind of cult- culture exchange as I had the opportunity to actually live as a Spanish and uh do what they do. And it was uh interesting because I do learn different things about Spain and Italy that I wasn't aware of, like for example the time you eat or the way you meet people. Also the characters very different as the uh Spanish people are more open than the Italians. So it was a very nice experience.
