Since I was young I always dreamed about becoming a bike racer. I always thought that was the best job that I could ever aim for, because uh it is fun because I really enjoy to take a ride and drive the bike. And also would give me the possibility to move around the world and see all the places where the tracks of the races are. I also believe that uh a career of a bike racer gives you the opportunity to earn a lot of money and then retire very early, so that you can enjoy the rest of your life blab.
