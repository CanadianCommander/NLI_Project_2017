The last book I read was about the Iraq war and it was written from the perspective of individual soldier who experienced um the three phases of the invasion in Iraq. Um he was with the US uh unit of the US Marines first Recon and he traveled up from Iraqi uh all the way to north area and to Baghdad heading further north and then returning to Baghdad. He described his personal experiences on this way and um also elaborated in that about the conflicts that he experienced between uh obedience and his personal responsibility.
