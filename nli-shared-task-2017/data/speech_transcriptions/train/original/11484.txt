During my free time I read a lot of magazines because I think um you can gain a lot information about um from it and um newspapers and stuff like that and um it's important for you daily life that you know what's happening around you and in the world. And so um that is what I think the most important stuff to read. And um I also read some novels but not that much as I read magazines or newspapers. And um I really don't like poetry.
