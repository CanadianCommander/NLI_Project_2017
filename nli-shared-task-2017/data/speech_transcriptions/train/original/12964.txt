One of the interest book, interesting books I read was The Alchemist. It speaks of uh Spanish uh shepherds called Santiago that is uh, that has dream under a tree in Spain about a treasure buried in uh in Egypt under the pyramids. He's following his uh dream by crossing uh, by crossing well, Spain. And it teaches us a li- it teaches uh um a lesson in life because he, he is living his dream and, but it's not always as expected because he won't find his treasure there but will find it back in Spain after someone else tells him.
