Uh I also live uh miss my friends a lot with whom I can share all my thoughts and secrets. Uh I didn't uh like the convenience of being at home because I'm free there, I don't have to worry about anything any other thing and I also miss uh to move out with my friends to hang around with them and to have fun. Um I really miss them a lot.
