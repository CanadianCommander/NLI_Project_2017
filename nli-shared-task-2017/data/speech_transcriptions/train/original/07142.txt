Well I'm not type of guy who read anything but you know I read sometimes I read magazines which is computer science magazines like PC magazine. I think because it's about my major. I started reading them when I was like the fifth grade until now. I stopped reading them uh like two years from now but I like to read computers magazines like hardware, software, web design, sometimes design itself like Photoshop magazines.
