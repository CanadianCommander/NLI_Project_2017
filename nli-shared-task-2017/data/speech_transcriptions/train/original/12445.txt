If I could have any job in the world, uh I would like be um a sports psychologist because since I was a kid um I liked very much the different sports that exist and I studied psychology and I think those two are uh grateful uh great combination uh for a science and I would like to uh work in that because in that way, I could kno- I could know uh how the performance is affected by cognition or emotion. So I would like to be a psychologist in the future.
