One of my major accomplishments was um a one year exchange to Brazil, my country choice was Brazil with the Rotary Exchange Organizations and um yeah stayed  there basically for one year and moving houses every three months uh learning the language, getting to know other people and um the inspiring thing was getting to know the culture, not just as plain tourist as an inhabitant. And yeah attended rotary meetings and basically got to know lots of the countryside as well because I didn't leave in major city. And yeah that was great accomplishment because it has um fostered my <%> and my personal goals.
