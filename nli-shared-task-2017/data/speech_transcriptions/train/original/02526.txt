What I miss most uh about um when I'm when I'm away from home um is family because um having a family um is uh is is very uh makes makes me feel comfortable and um makes me sure that I'm at home. Um another point are my friends. Having friends is very important for me and uh talking about some problems or um or some some some hobbies and some things very.
