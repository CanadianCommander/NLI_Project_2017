An accomplishment that was very important to me and required a lot of work, hard work was my admission into IET Delhi. The, the reason it was important to me was that firstly it required, it was very difficult to do as it  required two years of work and <%16.1> percent of the students applying was admitted into the college. However the <%21.0> of this uh accomplishment were also large. For example, if you get, got into IET you're getting in to the best college for engineering in India and hence you will receive the best education from all colleges. Further, this will help you get the best jobs for the future and also allow you to have the best opportunities in life. For this reason I believed that this accomplishment was my most important.
