One accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh, was  that uh the good performance of the group that I headed. Uh my groups uh at work uh was bring out three good projects for the science festival that is conducted at our college. Uh it, it, it required me to work very hard nearly ten to fifteen hours with the, uh without even sleep sometimes. It, it, it demanded a lot from like uh, like the leadership qualities, uh and the organizational skills. Uh also uh, uh the previous batch from other discipline uh, uh work had done the competition very well. So it, it rather uh rational responsibility on me to match up to their performance uh even to actually improve on that. So it was the best accomplishment I had ever done.
