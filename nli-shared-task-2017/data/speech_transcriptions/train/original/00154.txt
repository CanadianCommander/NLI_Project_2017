Of any career I wanted I want to be a ranger in a national park and also a country singer. So I would like to work as a ranger during the days and as a singer uh during the evenings. Uh because um this kind of career would combine the two things probably that I love most, which is nature and music. And um as a ranger I hope that I would be able to work in a park where you would have to do a lot of work in, on horse back because that's my other big passion, which unfortunately I'm not able to do um in my current life, but maybe in another life time I would be able to do that. Um and then in the evenings I would tour with my band as a country singer, so I could express myself in music and hopefully make people happy.
