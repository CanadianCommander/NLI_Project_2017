Uh actually I like magazines because they are all about general topics which you can have some idea uh and normally it's more funny to read a magazine. Uh but I'm now I'm talking about the magazines like about auto cars, sports, I mean the ones that are related with uh my enjoys. But the others like novels or poetry uh are not about uh my inte- are not my interest. Uh they can be more related with arts uh but I I get bored.
