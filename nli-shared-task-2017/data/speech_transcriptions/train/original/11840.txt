I had the amazing opportunity of working at a cancer hospital with patients with terminal diseases. I learned a lot from that experience because, it changed my point of view of some aspect of my life. And then I realized that I was a little shallow some times, and that I was a little maybe unfair with myself. Because I thought that I was a very kind per- kind person, and a very fine person with all the people at the world. And I realized that those people have many things to offer to me. And I learned a lot from them because they were people that were going to die, and they were conscious about it and it's.
