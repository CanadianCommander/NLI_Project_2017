I miss most about my mother when I am away, she is a very good woman. She has many good qualities, she is kind and tolerance, she knows uh young people very well, and she is a good listener, she always keep his mind opened.

From, from her I know a lot of good qualities, and what is more, she gave me a very happy childhood, and she, because she like children very much, because she like children very much.
