I would suggest them to visit Hyderabad which is the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, located in India. It is uh it has highly additional values and cultural values. Uh it, it has uh ancient uh monuments which uh predict history of India and also it's developed technically. Uh, uh we have a high tech city which is highly equipped and almost many companies have joined India in order to maintain their relationship with Hyderabad. So I think it's technically and culturally well developed so they have to visit.
