I would like to talk about situation where I had to prepare for um previewed. Um I have uh I play the piano for twelve years and when I was fifteen, I prepared for previewed um which was very important because it offered access to the local um music um university where I was able to get some lessons and I worked very hard for it. I prepared work fro- from Beethoven and it is very difficult but my teacher helped me.
