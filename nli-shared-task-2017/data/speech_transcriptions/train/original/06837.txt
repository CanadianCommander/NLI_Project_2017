The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is one of the most interesting books that I've ever read. It is interesting because it has a lot of secret codes and mysteries which we get to know as we progress through the book. We also get to know the contributions of Leonardo Da Vinci which we didn't know earlier. I think that having read this book, I've learned a lot about things which I've never heard of. And also about the secret societies which prevalent all over that time. All these things make this book a truly interesting and also that.
