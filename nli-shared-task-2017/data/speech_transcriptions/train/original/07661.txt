Uh I had read a book about uh the animals. It's a great book. It's talking about uh similar animals and uh a lot of animals like elephant uh, lions and it's talk about uh a condition that she lives on and uh what it lives on to eat and uh what's the problem that it's have from the other animals and there is uh another question in my mind that how that he solve their problems and uh between the animals.
