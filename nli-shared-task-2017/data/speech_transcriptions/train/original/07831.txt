What I miss most about being away from home is my family. Last year I went to the United States and I really had that experience. It was kind of hard when you  get to a new family and you don't have your parents next to you. It's always nice to have someone to talk to and that's what I miss most. My mum, I always had a good relationship with her so I'm having someone to really explain how I feel and someone to talk to. I also miss my brothers whom I am very close to. Uh my, my older brother he always helped me with my homework and we always spent time together and since in the Uni-, in United States I didn't have a house, brother or anything so it's kind of hard not having some.
