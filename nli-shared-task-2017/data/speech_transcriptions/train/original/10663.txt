A boo-, a book which I recently read was The Stranger by Albert Camus. This book really interested me because it was basically talking about a person who did not fit in society and challenged all aspects of society. He regarded everything that he did in his life as absurd. This is really interesting because today, uh always uh <%22.8> to everything and everything we do. However, this person didn't uh was, didn't care about anything he did and he, he based his life on ab- uh absurd views. For example when his mother died, he did-, he didn't show that he cared. All he did was he passively moved on and which led to his demise.
