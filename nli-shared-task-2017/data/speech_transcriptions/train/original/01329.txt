I'm away of home at the, the things I miss more are of course obviously my family uh because I'm not with them and I can see them really rarely, maybe during Easter and uh Christmas and uh sometimes just during the weekend. And so it is not so nice not to be always be in touch with them. The same thing with my friends because they are my old friends and I grew up with them and they are the people I know better. But even with them I can be with and of course all the places are really important because I knew them well because I as said I grew up there.
