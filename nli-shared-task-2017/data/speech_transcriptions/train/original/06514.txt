I read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from Douglas Adams. It's quite a funny book. It's uh gla- uh it uh it's uh s- uh science fiction story with uh quite a lot of mind-boggling and funny ideas. And uh because I'm working uh, I worked in computer science, a lot of computer engineers read this book and they see, you can see a lot of things uh in computer science. But, for example Babel Fish from <%37.5>, Babel Fish is a fish in the book that translates everything to a language you understand.
