I read about the uh the book about <%3.0> Krishna he's a great poet and he's a hero's poet. And I love his book because he, he <%10.2> many problems and he solved them very humorously and everyone can and I l-, I learned a lot, a lot of things to how to solve our problems by not bothering about ho- how we get the problem. So I love to read that uh <%31.7> Krishna he's the one of the poet in uh the three king.
