The accomplishment that required a very hard work from my side was the admission intensive course. For admission I had to score a good grade in the master's uh degree that is a C. I had worked uh very hard for this, completing and fill, uh completing a research that is <%26.5> very important  to me since I wanted to enter into a PHD course. So getting admission in the same field was very important to me. The hard work that I put in was a regular study, a routine study and good attention.
