I think the most interesting book I have read is Sophie's World. Uh it is uh, it provides an introduction to philosophy and I like philo-, and I, after I rea-, read that book I rea-, started to like philosophy. This book is written as a diary of a girl and uh it is really interesting to uh write a philosophy book as a diary.
