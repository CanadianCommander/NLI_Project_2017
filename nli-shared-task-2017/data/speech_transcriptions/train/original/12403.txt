There are different reading materials that I would like to read that are like the poetry and magazines. Poetry I uh I would read it during my weekends time and free time because I find the poetry that is touch uh human life and human experience. Actually sometime there is some points sort of like some different facts which happen to occur in our uh daily life. So that's why I like to read poetry. Another part I like to read is the magazine part because it is uh always consist of news that happen everyday and it is like source of news. Novels is one of my favorite but it is not like poetry and magazines.
