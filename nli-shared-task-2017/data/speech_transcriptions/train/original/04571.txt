A week ago I read biography of Abraham Lincoln. He's a person who united who, two disrupted country and I was surprised that the process of uniting. I realized that one man can have effect on whole nation. Also he was a person who had great leadership. I learn from the book I have to be one kinds of person such as honesty as I'm leader of my class therefore I'll be a person who like Lincoln, who can have effect on whole nation ha- and have great leadership.
