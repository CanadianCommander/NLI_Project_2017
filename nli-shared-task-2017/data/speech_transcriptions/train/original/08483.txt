When I um when I was away from my home the most thing I miss is the family of course because I work for my family and I'm a Korean and the Korean society the most important thing for living is the family and I work for Germany as expa- expatriate from the company and so I have experience of working alone in Germany before. My family is coming to Germany. It was about three months and the most difficult thing was the missing my family of course and the problem was solved when the family was come to Germany, came to Germany.
