I think the most interesting book I've read is Harry Potter. It was given by my father as my birthday present and when I started to read it, I was attracted by its amazing story plot. Um this I think uh the author describes uh a total of different world for us since the people there all have magic power. Um but on contrast it is uh a little similar to our world since um there are also <%> justice and uh hell fire and the evil um just like our our real world. Um just from reading it, I have learned how to reading English and a lot of.
