The last book I read which I found very interesting was the <%4.6> from, from, from <%6.5> very interesting book because first of all it's a very realistic book. It is a crush for example Tsunami catastrophe in Europe and different parts of the world and therefore it's very interesting. And second this book has really good plot, the action always changes and it's uh very good to read. And second it's very important, it's based on scientific facts. This is one thing that makes the book more interesting for the reader because you will learn during the reading somethings about uh science, in this case biology and the ocean biology especially. It is a good book.
