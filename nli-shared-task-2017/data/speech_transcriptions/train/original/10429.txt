Well, actually I think the most important thing of a member of a team is that you can rely on uh the member, because uh a team is uh, not a single, uh not a , not a single creation. It's uh depends on how you, how you're able to work together. And so uh each uh member has to be able to rely on uh the other members. And that's the main, uh main idea of a team. And do, I think that's the most important thing about it.
