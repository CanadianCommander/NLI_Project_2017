I had to work very hard in maths because uh during the secondary I got a lot of problems with um this accomplishment then I had to study a lot and it was difficult for me but finally I couldn't manage my difficulties with math maths and now I'm uh studied English and now I am trying to do a master degree. Actually I need to study more on maths and I need to to study trigo- trigonometry and I think now is easier for me because I have to study a lot during my secondary school.
