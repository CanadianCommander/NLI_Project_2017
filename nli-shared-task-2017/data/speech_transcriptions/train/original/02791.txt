The opportunity I think is, it was the most important one my life is it was the po- the possibility to work in a laboratory at the university because I like the laboratory life and, and when I was there I could met a lot of, uh meet a lot of people there. And the topics um they were working about uh were very interesting and they always, we can discover something when you are working in a laboratory because there are always uh topics and subjects that not everyone knows. And there are new ideas and new projects and I like very well, a lot this, this, this kind of job.
