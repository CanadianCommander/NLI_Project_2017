An interesting book about, which I have just read is A Painted House by John Grisham. I like this book because it was very interesting because it shows the life through the eyes of a young boy. Also it discovers and explores human emotions. As I said, it explores a life through the eyes of a young boy in the sense that the boy is the one who is describing the story and we come to know view, views from his uh his perspective towards looking at situations about what his family undergoing through. Also it clearly portrays human emotions and it enriches our experiences without actually going through those situations. Thus all in all I like the book very much because.
