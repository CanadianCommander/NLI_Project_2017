The opp- I think the most special opportunity that was given to me was the scholarship uh to go to Paris, uh to a language school. Uh when I went to there uh I had many friends uh in that school uh from different origins uh even Greeks uh and even from the Central Africa. Uh it was the first time that I went to Europe, so it was a co- uh compelling experience for me. Uh I very much liked it, and this experience gave me uh to have, to see different cultures, uh because it was the first time that I go out of my country. So it was perfect for me and interesting.
