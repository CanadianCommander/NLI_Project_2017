I just recently read Lois Gould's um biography novel um called Other People's Houses in which he describes her being um transported in March of nineteen thirty eight from Nazi Vienna to London with one of those children transports and and therefore escaping um a long time before her parents could be rescued um from Vienna. I like the book therefore very much because um it reports the events from uh children's distance. Uh so when is and um yeah a distance.
