I'm going to be advertiser in my career in the future for two reasons. The first reason is I'm good at creative ideas for commercial TV and then the second reason is I'm interested in media like broadcasting. I'm good at creative ideas because every time I'm looking at commercial on the TV I can think of them more much brighter ideas than the TV. Also I'm very interested at watching TV.
