Uh the most important thing that I miss is my family and especially my mother and the food which my mother cook because she is a cook cooker. And then I miss my friends and my dog. I love my dog because we grow up together, he is thirteen years old and you know all my uh childhood I passed with him. Then the most important thing that I miss is my old house and Fra- France and school friends because I'm uh far away from my own, uh and I miss that very much and I don't uh have too time to speak to them on the phone and you know communicate with them. Uh you know uh this is all about the most important that I thought uh below uh before uh I miss my family.
