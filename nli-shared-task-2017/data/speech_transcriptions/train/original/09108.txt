That there is three things that I miss when I am away from my home, first thing is my fiancée because it is really hard to live without him and uh but if we are talking about a thing in particular is my bed, my bed because um I don't sleep uh quietly and I really need my own bed to to spend a good night. So I really miss my bed and the other thing if I have a third choice is my kitchen because uh I really love cooking and uh I prefer cooking in my own kitchen than doing it in another kitchen where I don't know where are, where is the equip- the equipment and um and other things.
