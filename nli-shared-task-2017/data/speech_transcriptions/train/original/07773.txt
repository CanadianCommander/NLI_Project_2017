This was very hard because I had to go there when I was uh eighteen years and I was very alienate, I didn't want even there. I had to live and go on for my studies. And I didn't have any friends and I had to make, meet new people and this was a completely new culture for me and adapting to time. And it was very hard for me to survive in the start but as time passed by, I learn how to <%36.1> and then I completed my five years degree in a very, in a very accomplished way and I'm very happy about it.
