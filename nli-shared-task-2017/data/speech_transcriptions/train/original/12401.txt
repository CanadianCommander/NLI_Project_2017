I would like to read novels most of my free time. Um the main reason for that is um novels are very rich and imaginative and I think so many kinds of different characters and people described in this novels. They are also comfortably longer than magazines or uh poetry so I'd like novels the best in my free time to read. I especially uh prefer classic novels which uh present uh represent uh represent a time they were written, and they're uh generally.
