So guys that if that you might visit Florence of course because I live there and because is one of the most wonderful cities in the world and I think that is full of museums and interesting things to see and to visit. So you might surely get there and then you should visit Rome because of it's history and because all our civilizations starts from there. And then why not Milan because of the shopping and because it's the the fin- financial center in Italy. So it's gonna be interesting if you study management or something like that.
