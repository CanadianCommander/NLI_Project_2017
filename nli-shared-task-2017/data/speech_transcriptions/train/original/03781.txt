Harry Porter is very book that I have read. It talks about magic and the life about a boy as because uh magic is a thing that doesn't exist in the real world, I think it was very interesting to read about and that only magic was talked the word in the story. Uh a life about a boy who doesn't uh didn't have parents since he was a baby was illustrated very delicately and inside of the boy also was very well illustrated.
