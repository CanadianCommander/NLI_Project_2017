When I was eighteen years old I leave my country to pursue my college study in the capital city. I really missed a lot about my home. I missed the dishes made by my mother, I missed the father's talks and the instructions. And but the most important thing I, I miss is my mother's I, I re- my, my mom my from then on I don't have my mother's every day care. I remember that um the day I leave, my mother gave me a pair of shoes and tell me, with this pair of shoes you can go anywhere to fulfill your dreams. But wherever you g- live, I wi- I'll always be your mother and this will always be your home.
