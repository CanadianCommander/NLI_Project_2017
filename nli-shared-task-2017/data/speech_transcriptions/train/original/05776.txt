When I am away I mostly miss my family particularly my sister. Because we are really, we have grown up together. So we are, we love each other a lot. And uh of course my friends and my boyfriend because uh I need them every time. I need them to speak with them and so on. I also miss my pets uh it seems strange, but I do it because uh they are part of my life. I al- I've always lived with them. And then I miss also the people of my city because I live in a little town where everybody knows each other. And um I know a lot of people and we, I have, we.
