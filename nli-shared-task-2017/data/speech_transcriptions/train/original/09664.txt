One interesting book that I have read is the Da, Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. The first reason I believe that this book was interesting is the grea- uh the great examples that are being presented in the books regarding the ancient uh the the uh ancient artist and uh artist and the various uh art-, artifacts of, uh artifacts of the Roman culture. And the second, and reason I believe that this book uh is interesting is that uh the storyline of this book presented by the writer Dan Brown, he creates such an interesting uh storyline that it really captures your interest until unless you finishes the book.
