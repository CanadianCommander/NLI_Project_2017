In my opinion the, a value uh, the quality that the valuable member of the team is the <%6.0>, uh the, uh punctuality, because if the main member of the team is not punctual and not honest, then the uh other members are going to be not too, because the group, the rest of the member of the team is going to follow where, uh whatever the main member of the team is going to too. So, I think the, the uh the uh valuable uh, I think a main quality should be wha-, uh whatever the main member of the team is going to do. So I think the, the uh the uh, valuable uh I think a main quality should the person, uh the main person should have is the punctuality, honesty and his, his uh, his patient for, towards the work so other people can, the other people can get information from him.
