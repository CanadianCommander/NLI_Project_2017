Uh being appointed as the <%> secretary of my college was uh an opportunity that was very special to me because I was appointed by almost around five hundred students in the college and the faculty members. It was special to me because it has given me the opportunity to interact with the people from uh corporate wor- world and to work under pressure. It was like I was the head of the committee of around twenty uh uh class representatives of different branches and our task was to invite different companies to the college for recruitment and for the placement. It has also helped me to uh develop the leadership skills and the communication skills required in the corporate world. More importantly, it has given me a sense of satisfaction.
