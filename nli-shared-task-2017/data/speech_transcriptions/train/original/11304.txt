Well an interesting book I've read was The Sea of Fertility was a <%> chronology from Japanese author Yuko- Yukio Mishima. It was particular in the se- in sense because it was completely uh chronic, the values that were that were advocated by the author was those um would have been of Japanese samurai of the fif- of the sixteenth uh century but with this uh view with his view point um he he enlightened me on some well, on some aspects of modern life so.
