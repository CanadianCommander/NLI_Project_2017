One interesting book which I read in the recent times is probably It's Not Just About the Bike. It's Not Just About the Bike is the autobiography of Lance Armstrong. Lance Armstrong as we know is a very pop- sporting personality. He is cycling champion. The book describes Lance Armstrong's life before a catastrophe, that is before his ailment with cancer. It describes how he was a cycling champion who was very confident of all his abilities and later when diagnosed with cancer how his life changes. It describes his combat with cancer which is very inspiring and touching. He goes them from uh the battle with cancer to win the Tour de France.
