The most uh thing as uh my uh about away from my home is the family meals which which were which were made uh with all parts especially of the family members. The family meals are important in my cul- uh culture because the families the members when we come together in meals and they eat their meals together, these meals are the place for uh talking about regular subjects and place for um describing the their life. when I'm away from home I miss this subject very much uh because I can't find the other the numbers of my family in the meals and I can not uh uh describe my daily life to the people from my family.
