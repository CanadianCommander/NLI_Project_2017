One special opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity of studying in university. I studied in the university <%8.5> and that prepared me in very good for the future. And it was an opportunity for me to making new friends, uh for <%17.4> new and for confronting new challenges. That combine into the top preparation, and self improvement qualities. So the opportunity of being a university student also opens me into also the future, to be a good professional in my life.
