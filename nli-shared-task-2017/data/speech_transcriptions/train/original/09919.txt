The accomplishment that I'm very proud of is optimis- Optimist International Art Article Speech Contest, two thousand and three that took place in uh  Los Angeles, California in which I won the first prize. It was a <%16.8> contests and there were five levels club, area, zone and two final rounds. And the reason why it's very special to me is because firstly it gave me confidence to speak in public places. Secondly it gave me the fearlessnes. It took all my fear away from speaking publicly to other people. Thirdly it made me realize how good others were, so it ultimately become a better speaker both on stage and off the stage in my life.
