Well first of all I miss um my family uh when I am away from my home, because um I like my family a lot. And um so if they are not with me or if my family is not with me, then um I certainly miss it. Uh furthermore I will miss my friends, uh living um in my uh village where I come from. And um well I come from a small village with uh many uh animals and so on. And so I would also miss uh the surroundings, and um all um the people and um, um circumstances which are uh in this uh village, um I know.
