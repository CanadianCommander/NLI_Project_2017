The interesting book which I read recently is my own course book. It is interesting to me because whatever I read during my course time was maybe not clear to me and when I started reading now I was going into deep into the book which was making me more interesting. So I was reading topics one after the other so clearly that I could understand the topic very well. And it was interesting because whatever I studied during my uh course time is totally different whatever I am practicing right now. So it was making me more interest because it was in the few things which were new in the book it was the recent edition so I could.
