I was a child I have always been dreaming to be a doctor to fulfill this achievement I had to work hard since school since pre-elementary school, elementary schools and high schools to work hard requires a lot of time, a lot of energy. So I tried to have good marks at the exams before I attend university. When I was accepted, it was a very important accomplishment for me to attend this university because it would help me be a medical doctor.
