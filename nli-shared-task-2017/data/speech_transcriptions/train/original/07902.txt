When I'm away from home I mi- I miss many things like I miss my mum's tasty food and I miss brother's  affection and love, I miss my dad a lot and I also miss my pet named Leo, it's a dog, I love her very much. Totally I love my family um and I feel very bored, when I'm when I'm away from home because no one is there to, no one will be there to scold me my mum used to at home. And uh, uh me and my brother always uh ,uh quarrel each other and it will not be there when I'm away from home. So I miss my home a lot when.
