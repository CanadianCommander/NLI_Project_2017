When, when um I'm away from home, I first miss uh my familiar objects. Familiar objects like my bed, my uh <%10.2>, my uh phone and et cetera. Whereas my familiar objects I am used to I'm, I'm used to, to do every time the same thing the same, and I know the problem I should have with them. And so when uh I take those objects I don't uh know what uh what problem may happen. And the second thing is uh all the familiar activities I know that um at uh at seven o'clock, my mother always come home to prepare the dinner etcetera.
