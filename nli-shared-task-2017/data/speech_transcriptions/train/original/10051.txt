The special opportunity that Canada give me is when I, I'm in grade eleven in China uh I came to Canada many of my classmate have do the test to go to university, but where, in Canada, I don't need do a test to university all I need is the average mark of grade twelve course. So this is very a s- a really special opportunity they give me and I had the different way to go to university between people in China. So this is, opportunity is important.
