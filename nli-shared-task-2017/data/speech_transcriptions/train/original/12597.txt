I miss uh the luxuries I have at home, I miss um the way my room smells, I miss the, the things I've been provided, um the way everything is there for me. I miss um crinkles, I miss um how I'm just used to everything there. And how um now it's, it's more refreshing at home it's more comfortable, it's where you lived for a while. So it's what you'll miss the most, the little things, the comfortable things.
