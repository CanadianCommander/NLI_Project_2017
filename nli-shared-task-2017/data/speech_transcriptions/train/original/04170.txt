In the fr- in my free time I like to create mostly about science fiction. Uh the reason is that I, in my work I need to read about a lot of science a lot and science is boring. It has a lot of technical words, I don't know not too much meaning frequently it's not very well prepared. But science fiction on the other hand is very entertaining. It's a way that the scientist use to distribute information among other people who is not too familiar to a topic. I like to read a lot of science fiction. Uh my favorite author is Adolf Hitler.
