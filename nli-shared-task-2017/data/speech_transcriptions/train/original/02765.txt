A year before, I had opportunity to start assis- to assist a conductor in a children Orchestra here in my country. I am student of conducting, so to assist this conductor was very important for me. Because in all parts of the world, young people doesn't have these kind of opportunities. At this time I have been working with him for a year, and this will help me if, and this will help me to enter to some first grades that uh I'm looking forward to.
