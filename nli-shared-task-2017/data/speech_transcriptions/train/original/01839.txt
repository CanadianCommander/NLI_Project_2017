The most interesting book I read uh uh would be uh the Dan Brown's uh Da Vinci Code. I read it recently and it was the most fascinating fiction book I have ever read. Uh I, I couldn't leave uh, I couldn't uh stop myself from turning pages. I was glued to the seat with the book. Uh it was a true thriller uh, uh there was not even a single page uh uh where uh you felt bored or uh tired of reading. You never uh know uh when uh you complete reading and you just uh slow away uh and uh live uh uh along with the characters in the novel. That's the best book I read.
