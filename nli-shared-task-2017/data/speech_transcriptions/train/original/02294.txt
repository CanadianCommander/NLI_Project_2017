This is a question I cannot answer <%> one of those responses whether I like novels, magazines or poetry more depends on my mood, on variety of factors, on what kind of information I'm seeking to learn about. Obviously poetry is more appropriate for conveying emotions so if I'm in an emotional mood I might prefer poetry to magazines. If I'm seeking to learn about the lives of some people far away or long time ago I probably prefer novels to pro- poetry and magazines when I want to learn topical events current events I will probably draw magazines rather than poetry and novels which tend to be non topical.
