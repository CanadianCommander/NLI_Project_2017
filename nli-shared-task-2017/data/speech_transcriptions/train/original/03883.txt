If I could have any job career I wanted I would be a retail um shopkeeper of the uh clothing company because I am really interested in the fashion and in that way I get discounts of the clothes line they produce and I also meet numerous people, the customers and retail um other retail people and fashion designers. And the I can rest back my fashion style and also I can make connection with um fashion celebrities and also I can learn about the fashion including fabric design and trend. And so this is what I want to do.
