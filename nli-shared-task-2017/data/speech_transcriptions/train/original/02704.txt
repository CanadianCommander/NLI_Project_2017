An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was to become the head of the culture department of my college. The reasons why I believe that it was uh difficult to do and why it is important to me at the same time as follows. One is that the with the time constraints in the college it is difficult to cope up with uh doing extra work or some uh work which is presented by the curriculum. The other thing is to develop skills which are necessary in uh in order to become established certain fest and festivals which happen during the course of the semester. I also travel long distances and I must do this without sacrificing my studies so this whole new accomplishment is truly great.
