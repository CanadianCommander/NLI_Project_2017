Uh the biggest accomplishment that I must say would be that my ability to prove myself in a profession. I'm in advertising and uh, um I got my job which I have been working in since the past year. Due to availability that I had worked very hard in my internship and my uh immediate boss was so impressed with me that they wanted me back as soon as possible. Even though I have gone back to my college, after my internship I had two semesters left but my college thankfully gave me it's blessings and let me join work. Because we are, because in advertising you need to do uh, uh, a second year mostly on the work that we do. So uh mainly specialize.
