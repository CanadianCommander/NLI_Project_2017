The opportunity that I had in the recent time, let's say recently was the possibility to, to be introduced to my wife's father. Um this because he is an very important businessman. Actually he works as a managing director of an important branch of Citi group, which is one of the most important banks in the world. So this opportunity was really important to me because I had the chance to view from his perspective a lot of business issues and activities I only studied.
