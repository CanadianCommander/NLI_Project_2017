So as far as I'm concerned um I had to make an accomplishment that required me to work very hard. Um it's um I had to prepare a diploma uh when I was eighteen years old um because it was um the step to go university towards and um it was very important for me. And I had to work very very hard all the all the year because um the diploma at the end was um was very tough and um that's why uh I had to work every day to do my homework and to be uh serious and that's why um I had to prepare and to do it very hard.
