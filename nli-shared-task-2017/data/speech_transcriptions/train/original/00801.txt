The reading material I find more interesting are magazines and also books. The books about my career magazines because because they describe reality, they describe what is going on, the tendencies, the actual facts, the common affairs. Uh poetry uh I'm not much into poetry because sometimes it gets to complex and I just cannot understand what they're saying. So I guess in my free time I'm most likely tend to read magazines.
