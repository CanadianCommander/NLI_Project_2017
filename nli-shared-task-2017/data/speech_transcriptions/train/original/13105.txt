I was involved in a project widely to work very hard during its last stages. I work for late hours  for a long period of time along with the few colleagues of mine. This made me understand the importance of hard work and the importance of working with colleagues. It also help me in understanding the project better and help the project in meeting it's deadline. I received, I received a let- of, I received praise from my manager for the work I did on the project.
