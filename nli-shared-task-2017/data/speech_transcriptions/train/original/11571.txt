If you need to work very hard I will suggest three things are important. The, the first one is confident. When you are, when you are full of confidence, you are willing to do something in your work very hard. And the second thing is put your all, your efforts into that work. If you don't try hard, if you don't try hard enough, you can't work very hard in your work. And the most im- and the finally the most important thing is to schedule your time properly. If you do not know, if you don't know to how to use your time, you cannot be work hard.
