I miss the food most uh when um away and uh for example, I was in Australia last year and I miss the food the most and the Japanese is very special and I couldn't make anything. Myself when I was in Australia, so it was very tough for me to not not to eat Japanese food. In Australia, so I think the food was the most. So I've been missing my time in Australia I think and then.
