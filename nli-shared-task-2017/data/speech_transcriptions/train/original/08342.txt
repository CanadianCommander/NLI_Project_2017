Well the, the most special opportunity I was given was once I was working on a public job then uh an acquaintance of mine offer me a job on a, on a rival place working for a telephonic company of my country. Uh this was a very special opportunity to move from private in, in, in to the private sector that is much more rewarding in terms of experience and in money. Uh in the other hand it was also a very special opportunity to work in a environment with many other engineer that because, that is my major field and I get great experience about it.
