There are several qualities uh member of a team should have because it's um it it's a big difference if you're working in a team or just by yourself especially should not be egoistic for example and I think what's really important is that you um talk and and listen and listen to to people what they say that um you can communicate very well and that you are not someone who just thinks about um you your yourself. You should be thinking about the team and that team um goals.
