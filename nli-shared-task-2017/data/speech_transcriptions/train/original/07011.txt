Coming to Jordan would be a very great adventure for, for you guys to, to do. Uh first we could go to the capital city which is in Amman. Amman there is plenty of things to do, there are great places to visit, um we could go to a club, sports clubs and night clubs and to coffee shops and to restaurants, great restaurants. Uh we can go to, we also could go visit Petra which is uh which is going to be um one of the new, one of the new seven wonders of the world maybe in short time. We could also go to <%37.7> which is a gulf city on the Red Sea. We could also go to the dead sea which is the lowest point on earth um and that is about it.
