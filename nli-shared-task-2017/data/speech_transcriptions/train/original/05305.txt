Last year I had to to take my midterm examination and it was really difficult because it was my first examination and I had to prepare a paper on political economics that was really difficult because I had to search for different information and organize them into a speech in the paper. Moreover, I had also to prepare for exams. One of them was about math. So I had different uh problems to solve and the professor required me to demonstrate how I uh want the solution in time I had. Uh after this examination the other following bit were really simple.
