I think the enthusiasm is the most important thing for me to accomplish one thing, because if I don't have en- en- enthusiasm I don't have lot energy to do everything the way I want. So if I lose my enthusiasm, I will lose the energy to accomplish the, the work. And without uh enthusiasm people cannot find the truth of a problem. So if I want to find a, find a, if I want to state a problem I have the, I have to have enthusiasm.
