I think uh the most thing uh I miss when I'm away is uh first my family and my friends and um when I'm in uh foreign county, it is difficult because when I have home sick uh I would like to have my family um next to me. Other points is also the way of life of living is um the most important the food and some counties it is difficult to find the same food as at home. And also the languages it is difficult to understand all the people when I don't speak really good the languages. For example, living in Germany is difficult understand German um and the communication is um not simple.
