If I would have a friend of mine who would come to my country, I would definitely uh tell him to come into the city where I live in which is Rome. First of all, because I would like to have him near me and second, because I would, I think Rome is a really good place to visit because of its history and all the monument. Because of the art exhibition. Because of the weather and because of the sea, which is really near to the city. And uh for example I had a French friend who came last year. And uh with my scooter, I take her around the city seeing the coliseum and in the weekend I took her to the sea and a really good restaurant.
