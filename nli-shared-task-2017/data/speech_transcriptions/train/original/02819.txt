What I choose is golf you know the sport. Uh I'm a golfer and I know it's a very hard sport because uh first it's very technical and it's very <%> too. So uh golf you need to work very hard everyday because you need to feeling you have to improve your technical so um you are supposed to to practice about about four hours and and go on the golf course and always train to find what is best, what the movement is best. So golf yeah you need to practice very hard everyday.
