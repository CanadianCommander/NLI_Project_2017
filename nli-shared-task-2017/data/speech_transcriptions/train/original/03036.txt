Well I think that Chicken Soup is one of the interesting book I have read. Uh for one thing uh the chicken soup uh contains uh dozens of funny stories um which always make me laugh and another reason for that is uh I always share the Chicken Soup with me friends so we will have a debate or discussion about it. Uh and so in all in all uh the chicken soup can provide me uh the the funny story and the remind me of the happy happy hours I spend with my friends and that's all.
