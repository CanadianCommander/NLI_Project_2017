I like to read the magazine about sports and novels about uh fantan- fantan- fantasy novel because if I I'm interesting on playing sport and like if i reading it, there will be interesting on it and it's not, is I'm gaining more knowledge from the magazine, but if I read like magazines like which is out of my interesting interest, then I will easy to get bored and is like wasting my time. And also reading fantasy novel, is not realist, is not real, is not real, it's not going to be happening in real society but, you you gain more knowledge about like imagine and stuff. So your imagine skill get improved.
