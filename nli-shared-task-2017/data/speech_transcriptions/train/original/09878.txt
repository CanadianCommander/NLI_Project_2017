Could choose a job career that I wanted I would like to be a full time mother. I grew up in a home uh which my mother was a full time mom. She was always there to take care of us, uh she run all her errands while we were at school, so that when we came home from school she was always there uh to help us with homework. She always coaches us uh to do um other activities. She would take time to take us to other activities like piano lesson or sport activities, so that we don't have to depend on others. So I think a full time mom job is very fulfilling and has a lot more value than other jobs I could have.
