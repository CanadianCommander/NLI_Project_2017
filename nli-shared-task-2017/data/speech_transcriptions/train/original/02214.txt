If you're open minded, you can first tolerate other ideas and respect them and that's very important when we have to make a decision. It makes uh moreover. It makes the group more efficient because if you're open minded, you can have some new idea that some people will not have if that talk into a place and a culture. And finally when you're open minded, generally you have listened to the people and this um very important here. That's why I mind it.
