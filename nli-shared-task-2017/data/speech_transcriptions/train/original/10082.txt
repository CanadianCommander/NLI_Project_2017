I have a special uh opportunity to working in a, in a U.P.C that is working as a research assistant. I think that is very special for me because uh being new immigration um you have to have uh a lot of American experience and I can be working in U.P.C that is a quite good experience for me. Because a lot of um, um employee of the year once you have experience is uh formally and I got this uh experience. That is why I can got right now the job, this <%35.6> because the employers trust me, I can finish the job and I can perform all the standard things. That is why I think so.
