I'm already experience this uh stage because I am studying in <%4.0> which is nearly forty kilometers away, away from my home. And I can um, um without any doubt I can say that I really miss my family. Uh and uh I grew up with a huge family, living in a huge family with two brothers and my parents and my um grand father and grand mother uh in the same as. Uh I can really say that I miss them a lot, and especially um my animals, uh which uh I really like um and trying to have them to have them around them around me, playing with them all the time. And last but not least I'd definitely miss my friends.
