When I'm away from my home I miss my family the most because I love my mom and love my sister and love my dad and it is really hard for me to stay away from them, so I miss my family the most. And secondly I miss Korean food. As you know Korean food is very spicy and very delicious and when you're, when I'm away uh I usually stay in the English spoken country and I cannot find sometimes I cannot find the source like ingredients that I'm looking for in order to make Korean food. So that what I mo- that's what I miss.
