In my free time I like to read magazines. The reason I like to read magazine is that it helps me make aware of what is happening around the worlds well as in my own country. It helps me to increase my general knowledge, also it helps me be aware of the sports issues because I'm very big fan of sports. So it helps me to learn what's happening around the world in sports. Also reading magazines helps me to improve my vocabulary as well as communication skills. The editorial section is very helpful to improve my communication skills as well as vocabulary. So I prefer reading magazine during my free time.
