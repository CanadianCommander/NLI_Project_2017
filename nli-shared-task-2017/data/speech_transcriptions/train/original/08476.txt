Well as uh a political analyst student I would like to specialize in international relation, and probably if that was possible work for the U- United Nations, as uh regarding to the uh I mean work on world conflicts and all the stuff. And uh I think that would be really interesting because my job would mean something, it won't be and it wouldn't be like, any of this job where I would have to stay in some uh behind some kind of desk all day long. So that's what I would like to do.
