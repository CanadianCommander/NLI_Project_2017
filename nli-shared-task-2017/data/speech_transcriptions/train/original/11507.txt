When I go abroad I just miss my parents because they are always there if I have any problem. And also uh my sister. I couldn't believe it when it happened to me, because I when I'm at home I always fight with them. So I don't know maybe when I was uh abroad I, I miss I don't know maybe fighting with them or just talking and I don't know having fun with them. And also it might be uh I don't know but my room is my space where I have all the things I want that I also miss it.
