One of my favorite books is A Tale Of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. During my study for English literature at school I like this story, I like this story very much. On one hand it was full of images, it was full of contrasting. Indeed the the title deflects the contrast between two cities London and Paris. This was also deflected in the language used especially the very very nice introduction has started the the novel. On the other hand I also like the sacrifice that human being was not in the forefront of the events yet he was true runner of the whole events. I love this story.
