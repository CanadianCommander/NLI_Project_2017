To friends from another country I would suggest to uh visit our home town church. Because it's in very old place with uh very thick walls and very high um colorful uh windows where the lights floating in. And uh you can sit there and uh have a good time, um and to relax and release stress. You um are in a very calm environment, and it's uh very uh quiet in there. You can decide about your life, your plans, you can even see uh ancient uh paintings on the wall. Um yes that's what I would suggest to friends.
