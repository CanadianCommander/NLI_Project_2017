The most interesting book I have ever read was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It was an imaginary book, book with wonderful ideas. And it has shown how a person can get in too much of trouble in his life or even become a prisoner while he is uh a victim. This book has been a very wonderful book and it has more details even than the movie made about Harry Potter.
