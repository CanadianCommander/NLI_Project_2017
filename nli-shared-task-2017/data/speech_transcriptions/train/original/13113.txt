What I miss most about um my home when I away is uh first of all my friends and my family. Now I live in another country, in another city and uh I miss them a lot and uh my habits, where I live um all  the activities I had, I can't do these here. And uh sometimes you have always things that you, that you um forgot uh at home and that you needed. It is always like that, you forgot something and you need it in your way. It is a very annoying when you don't have it with you.
