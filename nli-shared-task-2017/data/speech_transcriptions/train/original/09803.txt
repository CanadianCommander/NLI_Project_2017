The most interesting book I've read was um A Dry Wide Season by André Brink. The story takes place in uh South Africa during the apartheid and I thought it was really interesting because uh it's uh written by a South American writer. And he talks about his own country but he, he can show uh, show he can pi- uh pinpoint uh its shortcomings. And we see all the system of apartheid and how segregation of black people and all the injustices that um like people suffer during this time. And I thought it was a really interesting subject.
