While I'm abroad I uh first missed uh my uh family, my parents in particular, my brother and sisters. Uh I miss the food and my mother prepares which is very good food and that healthy one. While I'm abroad I don't eat that healthy food, it's usually the junk one. Uh also I miss my friends who who I go out with and uh spend my time with. I also is the routine days of work and uh doing all that stuff at work.
