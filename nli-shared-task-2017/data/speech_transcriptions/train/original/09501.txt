When I'm away from home the thing that I miss the most are my parents and my siblings. Uh I miss the comfort and the warmth that the environment for home gives to me. I miss I miss the love that my parents give to me and the conversations the uh that I have with my parents. Uh uh something that I miss the most is the food that I get at home, com- compared to my colleges can- canteens food my mothers home cooked food is way better. I miss the friends that I have made throughout my childhood who live around my house and I miss their company. I miss the uh thank you.
