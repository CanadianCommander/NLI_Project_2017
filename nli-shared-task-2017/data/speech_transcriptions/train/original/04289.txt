Personally I prefer reading poe- poetry among three types of literature. There are several reason for this, first because my parents like reading poetries and there is a lot of books on it in my study, in my home. Ever since I was a little boy I have read I have read a lot and uh and then when I was in high school I received some professional training on writing poetries. This all increased my interest on poetry. The more but I think the most uh in ordinary I like it is that you can also convey a great meaning from so limited lines.
