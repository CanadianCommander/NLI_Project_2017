What makes someone a valuable member of a team I think is uh trustfulness and that this person accept criticism. Um for instance, I play in a handball team and I think that the other pl- uh games of this team had to accept what's uh what's another player said to improve uh his quality and uh um um I mean the the aim is that uh the team would be uh winner and if all all the member of this team uh make an effort.
