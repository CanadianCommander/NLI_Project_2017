In my leisure time I prefer reading magazines since there is a huge variety of different magazines on the market and uh I'm traveling a lot so if I go into the corner at the station I can find a huge variety of magazines in every kind of interest for the people and of course also of my interest. So uh I enjoy reading the magazine when I take the train and is combined with beautiful pictures it is not that hard to read than a novel or a newspaper so I can have very good information in a very efficient time and is also entertainment and the time goes by very fast. And I arrive at my destination.
