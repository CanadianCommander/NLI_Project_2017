I could suggest them to visit first of all Granada which is one of my favorite cities because of in the past of <%> I think it's one of the most marvelous monuments we have here in Spain. Then of course to visit Madrid because it's capital city of our country and has a lot of museums and then as opposed to <%> visit Barcelona which is very nice city too. It has a port and capital and um people is very nice and I suppose it's a good place to understand and learn parts of Spain your typical.
