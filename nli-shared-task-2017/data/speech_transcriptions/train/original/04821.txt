I can do a lot of things and in my bedroom have a lot of photos and also uh a lot of book which um is very uh interesting for my studies and also for my uh and also because there are about my my uh favorite books. And uh I can't also sleep very well in my bed. So I like the way uh <%> in my bedroom.
