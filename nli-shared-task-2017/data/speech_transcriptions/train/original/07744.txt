An accomp- accomplishment that I've achieved is about getting my uh getting me selected to I.A.T. That is the it is clearing for the engineering stroke technology entrance exam. Though yes it was important to me as required it required much hard work and a lot of effort and support of my parents. <%> in the long run it will help me to find easy jobs and to apply in the good foreign universities as my credentials will be strongly supported by the name that IAT's have made in the world so far. Yeah, that's it. Thanks.
