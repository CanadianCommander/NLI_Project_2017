If friends from another country were going to time  in my country, the city that I would suggest that they visit would definitely be the city that I live in and that is Mumbai. The reason why I feel so is primarily because I have been brought up in this city and feel I can do utmost justice in showing them around the city and giving them a real feel of this city. Mumbai, apart from that is is, apart from being the city that I'm brought up in is also an extremely friendly people. I would definitely like to show off the people that it comprises of and of course Mumbai also has quite a few tourist attractions like the Gateway of India and the Taj. the hotel Taj, of course.
