To me the main quality of being part of a group is the open-mindedness. In fact um you have to be open minded, you have to be able to listen to what every member of the group has to say. That's what's important and that's what uh what makes a team work valuable. If you are ready to exchange your opinion but also to accept opinions that you you never heard before or that uh you you never read about well um this is a valuable quality that makes you an important member of a team and that make that makes a team work valuable.
