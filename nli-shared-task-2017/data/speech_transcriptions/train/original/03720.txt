The most thing that. The most thing I miss when I'm away from home is the first thing is mother's love and I'm much concerned between relationship with family members and I miss a lot about the food, shelter and not only that I miss my mom mothers love. And When I'm at home I never get depressed of anything or else and they used to get, they used to take much care about me. And not only like that.
