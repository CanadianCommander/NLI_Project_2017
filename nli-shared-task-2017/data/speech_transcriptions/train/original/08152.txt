So when I'm away um what I miss most is uh my family and my friends because um when I'm a lone um I meet them and uh, and uh they are my, uh my rock so, uh I have to, so I have to have them  near me to uh to be, be,  to feel uh good. And after that uh it is particularly when I'm abroad what I miss the most is uh my comfort and the food, especially when I'm in England because uh I prefer French food, so I think it is what I miss most.
