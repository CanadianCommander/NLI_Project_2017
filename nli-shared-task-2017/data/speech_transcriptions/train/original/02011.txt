What I miss most when I'm away uh are my friends and my family at home. I miss to chat to them to go out with them and to have fun to laugh with them. Uh further more I also miss my home I can use my own bathroom uh where I can listen music where I can just relax in front of the TV and so on. Further more I miss my street and the uh restaurants, food stores uh they're in the street because of uh the excellent food they provide to me.
