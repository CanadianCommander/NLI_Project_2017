A very interesting book I have read is titled Bleak House by Charles Dickens. I am a lawyer to be and I really would like to become uh an attorney so that's why this book uh focused on a big and very interesting issue, very interesting top-, topic because uh it is not only about the the legal ambiance but moreover abou- the literature is pretty, pretty bright and pretty accurate and I really really uh I am very fond of literature and uh cultural uh issues especially uh at that time.
