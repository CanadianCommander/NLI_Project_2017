If I could have any job or career I wanted, I would be a teacher. Since I wanted to become a teacher from childhood, this has been a dream for my life. Furthermore, I like teaching others and I like when they understand what I taught them and getting um something that they didn't know before. Also, it a teacher is a very stable job and I'm able to make a good saving for myself and a proper lifestyle for myself and my family that I will have in the future. Because of all these reasons, I would have teacher as a career.
