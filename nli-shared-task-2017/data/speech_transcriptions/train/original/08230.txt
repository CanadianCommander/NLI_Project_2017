If friends were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest them to visit as many spa- uh sports in Germany as possible. I would begin to show them Germany's capital Berlin because there is a lot of history that is very interesting including the wall of Berlin and a lot of museums. Then I would suggest them to go to Southern Germany to see the Alps and the mountains there and to discover this part of Germany. And then I would propose them to visit Northern Germany, the shores at the <%37.6> sea and the north sea so that they get uh good insight of Germany.
