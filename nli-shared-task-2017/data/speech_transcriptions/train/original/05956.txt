I think a quality makes someone a valuable member of a team it's three reasons. One of the reasons is reliable, because in a team some person have real strong reliability. And secondly, they have energy, energy, because they have, they have to make some-, another people happier. And finally, I think uh responsibility also, is also important for a team member, not the quality. So, from the reasons, I think there are three kinds of quality in member of the team.
