In my opinion the most important and valuable quality for a member of a team is deter- determination of this one. Because this quality helps the other people not to give up but to uh look forward their purpose and go on with their work. It's also the characteristics I will attribute to a good leader because good leader has to motivate this determined uh with determination uh the tempers of all his companions.
