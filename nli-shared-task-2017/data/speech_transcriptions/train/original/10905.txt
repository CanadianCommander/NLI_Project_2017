If one of my friends will travel to my country, I'd prefer to recommend him or her to travel to Beijing. Beijing as you know is the capital city of China and there is bunch of the place of interest there. Just like um uh Palace Museum and um um Tiananmen Square which is the most famous one and there is another one that is really worse to go, that is called um uh the population of the whole. I'm not really sure, I'm not really sure about the name which is a circular thing. But I'd prefer to say that Beijing is the best place.
