Uh personally um I really like to read novels in my free time um due to the uh fictional and entertaining character, I think it's much more more interesting and uh well entertaining to read those in your free time. Um by reading novels and you can build a basically your own world and um can just some sort of relax next your normal study books like um financing books or law books. Well due to that in my opinion it's much better to read entertaining stories than just facts or yeah.
