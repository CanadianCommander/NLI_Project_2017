I guess that when I'm away from home what I miss the most is being away from my family and my friends. I love spending time with them and when I'm away from home um what I miss not being able to speak to them everyday and um having their presence which is really reassuring to me. I also miss uh not finding myself um as <%24.0> when I'm at home. At home I know where things are um I know uh that I have my things that are there, my books, uh my music, um the part I go to walk close to my house, everything is just there and um I think I feel at home.
