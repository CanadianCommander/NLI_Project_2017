The most interesting book that I have read is the book titled Gitanjali and this book has been written by one of the famous au-, famous authors in India, that is uh Rabindranath Tegore and I find this book very interesting because in this book Tegore explains uh in fact he actually uh gives poems which uh take us to an imagination, a scene of imagination and in these poems Rabindranath Tegore praises God and invites God with all his poems and I really like this book a lot, it, it is very interesting because uh it is more uh than imagination and we get deeply involved when we listen to the poems.
