I prefer to read magazine because first magazines contains a lot of new stories such as South Korea's nuclear weapons in the Times magazine. And second that uh some of the magazines are just Scientific American contain a lot of beautiful pictures of the moon of the co- comet. And third that reading magazine can help me develop language skill. I can learn some useful word and paragraph seeing in the magazine. I can learn how American people talks in some magazines because they have content about TV series and those magazines help me a lot so I love reading magazines.
