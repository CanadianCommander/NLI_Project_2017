Uh the special opportunity that was given to me was a trip to Australia to go and study there for uh my higher education. I think that um, I take that as a special opportunity because I was able to um see the place, meet different kind of people and learn how people handle situations because I've travelled to few other places and I have, and, and I could find uh variations in uh in people's responses to different things. Uh the place was, was just perfect um the whole cultural uh back drop of it was uh very uh.
