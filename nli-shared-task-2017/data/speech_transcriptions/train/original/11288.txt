The thing I miss the most when I'm away from home is my family members. My parents and my younger brother are really the source of inspiration to me. I talk a lot with them, I even fight with them there are times and I miss all this when I'm away. It's not only this but the encouragement they give me at every step. They are, they form the backbone of my creativity, the backbone of my success and the backbone of what I am today. Whenever I go outside I make it a point to call home but it's always better that the physical presence is around me. I miss them a lot when I'm away.
