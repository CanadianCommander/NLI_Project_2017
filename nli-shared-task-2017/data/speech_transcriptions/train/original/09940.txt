If a friend from another country uh were going to spend time in my country uh I would suggest him or her to spend time in Izmir because in Izmir the weather is very good it's always sunny. And as there and as it's uh uh it's uh has a lot of historical places to see uh which will be great for my friend. And I believe that the people in Izmir are very friendly and he or she can uh have new friends in here uh so I would choose.
