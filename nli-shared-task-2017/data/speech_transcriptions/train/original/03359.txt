I was given an opportunity to come to United States as exchange student. Uh actually I'm a pharmacy student and this opportunity was really a great chance for me to come and get to contact with other students here in the United States of America. And uh it gave a lot of social skills and communication. Uh it gave me a  lot of information also and uh a lot of knowledge about the world around us, uh because sometimes when you are from a different country, you only know about your culture and your customs but when I came to the United States it was really a great chance for me to get in contact with other students.
