My <%01.4> time, eleventh and the twelfth standard was spent in preparing for the IET JEE exam that is to get selected into the premium institutes of India for doing my engineering. The three, the two years was spent working very hard, studying subjects like physics, chemistry and maths primarily. Preparing for the competition so as to get selected in one of the best colleges in India. The competition is really tough in India, because the number of available seats is less as compared to the number of students who are sitting for the paper. The ratio usually lies to about thirty students competing for a single seat. So this was one of the best accomplishment in my life of which I had to work very hard.
