Staying away from home has definitely made me very responsible and very independent. But same time I feel I don't miss many things in my life because certain values certain memories which only a family can provide. No one can ever replace those. Most importantly I miss my mom's homemade food, I am a die-hard fun of my moms food whatever she makes is completely yummy. It's very good to taste and also I miss those long walks with my dad I used to have in front of my house. We both used to catch up playing basketball every time I used to he would come back from the office. It was very interesting that time and also I miss him.
