One accomplishment that required me to work very hard was getting good grades in my tenth grade board examinations. This represented the culmination of ten years of school life and I'm happy that I scored pretty high, I got a ninety three percentage. And this was achieved after intensely preparing for more than a month and a half. This required me to study ten subjects each of them I had intense and uh quite long cold syllabus and that required me to manage my available time to prepare for each of the subjects and go and efficiently answer the examination, get a good mark. Hence after uh this was done and I achieved as per my I could do it as per satisfaction it was very satisfactory.
