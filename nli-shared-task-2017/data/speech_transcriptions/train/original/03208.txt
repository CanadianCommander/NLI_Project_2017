Well first of all, what I would like to choose is the job that I like, and it um or uh or the job I like and also the thing what mostly most likely are everyone in this life like to choose the thing that he likes so if I choose any job I would go to the job that I like and also I will go to the job, I would choose the job that I really uh that I want uh that I know that I will do my best and I would be success in this job or in this career. So I want to choose anything that don- that doesn't help me at all in my life. I want just something that help me and something that I know a lot in this like I would choose a job that I'm good on it and also the job that I would do well in it and I would choose a job that would.
