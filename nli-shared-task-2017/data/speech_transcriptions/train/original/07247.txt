I miss many things when I'm away from home I miss environment because I' from Ecuador and the mountains. It's a glamorous view when you actually see it tremendous mountains that are five thousand four hundred meters above the sea. I also miss people and how they are different to many other cultures. Also I have seen that depending on where I am I miss some kinds of things, I love my country and I miss my family the most.
