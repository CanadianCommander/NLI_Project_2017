There are many qualities in an individual which make him worthy of being a good member of a team such as sincerity and honesty. But personally, if I had to choose one, the honesty is the important quality which I would like to have in a member. Honesty is important because it ensures that everybody in the team can trust a person who is a part the team with them. Honesty is also important so that a person of the who is a part of your team, if ever commits a mistake, owns it up and makes it easier for other people to make up for that mistake. If a person who is in your team is honest, you can rest assured that he is sincere and his efforts are totally dedicated for the betterment of the team and everybody else who is working for the team.
