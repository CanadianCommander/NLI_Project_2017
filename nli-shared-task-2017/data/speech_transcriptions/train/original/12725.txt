One of the most interesting book that I've read recently was uh Brain by Bernard Werber, the French writer and I really liked his approach on those kind of scientific matters that have actually dealt with the human incentives and those functions of the, functions of brains and how, how human actually reacts to those things which actually makes, makes us act. For example it said that those kind of things, that well those brains, acts and cannot be overwhelmed when they're stimulated by the incentives, which are just <%42.0> incentives and we can be stronger than before.
