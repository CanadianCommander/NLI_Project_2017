An interesting book I have rec- uh was from <%4.0> who was a stock-exchange expert and a financial analyst. This book was very interesting because uh he worked for over s- seventy years in this business and had a lot of experience about this market. And this book was full of little stories to illustrate uh when he was or what he mean by talking by talking about the financial markets. Uh besides that he gives a lot of advice for the practical uh work of a trader.
