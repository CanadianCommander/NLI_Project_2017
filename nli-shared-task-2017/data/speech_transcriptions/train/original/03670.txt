Um an interest book I found is the The Lord of the Ring. It is a fantasy novel uh, uh about the adventures of Hobbit to destroy the uh, the rings. I find it is a very interesting because of the book uh portrait how the Hobbit can save other people by his own <%0:25.3>. And that it, the book also saw the friendship between the Hobbit and the, and his other uh, uh people or other <%36.3> who uh support him. And so I really think that uh this book is a interesting fantasy novel.
