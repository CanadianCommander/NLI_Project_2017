I love to read poetry and novels for very different reasons. Regarding poetry I like when the authors express their feelings and what they think about what have us around them. Regarding novels I love the interesting stories uh explaining and I will and I also like to find similarities wi- with reality while keeping the fiction the <%> side alive. I personally do not find magazines quite interesting because they are primarily superficial and do not reveal the personal side of the people who write them.
