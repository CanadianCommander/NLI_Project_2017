Given the option between job and the career, I would definitely choose working. Uh because I always prefer an independent life. When you have a job of your own you can be independent and all by yourself and I have no much of interest in studying further. I would like to see myself as an independent working women and by having a job you can have all your goals fulfilled, you can have a perfect family life and you can lead a standard life as you wish. And even the standard of living improves if you get a satisfying job.
