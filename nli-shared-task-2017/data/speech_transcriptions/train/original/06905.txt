I think what I would mostly miss is my family and friends because I have become very attached to them in time. My family means a lot to me and so do my friends. Also I think I would miss um my free time activities as going to the cinema and uh maybe even picnics and bike rides, but mostly I would miss my family, my friends, my pets, my room which would be hard re-adapt, but I'm sure I would do a good a job adapting to the new situation because I know it is worth it and I will get used to it and um learn how to live without the things I mostly missed.
