A very important my special opportunity was given to me was to be able to come to USA because it's a international place and I've been able to live in community with international people, with people that comes from all over the world with different religion, cultural way of seeing things. And so it was a really, really good, it was a great opportunity for me to be able to go into this school. It had opened my eyes to the world and to the and to the different civilizations. And I ca- and it's that was a great thing.
