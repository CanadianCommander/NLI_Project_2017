Among all the reading materials, I think I love magazines the most because I can learn news from the magazines like daily news, international use, news to help me to know the world better. And uh the other thing I can learn from the magazines is like the funny stories. It makes me laugh all the time and makes me relax when I feel tired of the whole day. The the best of my favorite magazine is the week of and summary of the NY Times. It's like combine all the things together.
