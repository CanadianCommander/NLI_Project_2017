If friends from another country are going to visit my country. I'll suggest them to visit Jaipur. I have visited that place many times and I like that place very very much because it has lot of diversity. One hand it is a historical place, you can get lot of marvelous buildings and places to see and enjoy it on the other hand it has bird sanctuary located in <%> it has sanctuaries like <%>. So they got lots and lots of diversity to see. Other than this Jaipur being a part of Rajasthan is very colorful so.
