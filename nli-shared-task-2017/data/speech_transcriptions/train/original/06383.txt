What I miss most about home when I'm away is first of all, of course my family and my known surrounding. Um that is why I actually don't like being that away for longer time period. Um also I do miss my, my friends of course. We do a lot at the weekend, we hang out um at the cinema, we go to movies, we uh often play basketball at the court in our hometown and <%37.7>. Um last but not least I miss my girlfriend for sure, um I'm Bridget, friend.
