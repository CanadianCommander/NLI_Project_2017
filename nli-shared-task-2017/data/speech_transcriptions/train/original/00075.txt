An important book that I have read is The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. I think is is very interesting for me because it has a lot of moral content that it makes you to think over lot of things. Another point is the interesting story because it talks about a man who is following his dream. So uh in this uh in this journey he finds everything that he needs and he uh he gets a complete experience about what we have, what he has and all the things around surrounding him. So in conclusion for these two reason The Alchemist is one of the most int- interesting book they have read.
