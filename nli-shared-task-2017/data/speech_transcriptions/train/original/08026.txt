When I'm away what I miss the most is most of the time my my family and my friends who made everything important so it's nice to be with them. Uh I also miss things like the comfort of my uh place of my home because there I have at least my mother who cooks for me very good food. So of course she is that I really miss when I'm not at home. And I also miss uh the activities I usually do. Uh for example doing some sports or uh biking because it's things that I really enjoy to do at my place and in other places, I can also do but a different way. I'm used to do it as as I do it in my place. So it's all the things I miss.
