Well first of all, when I'm away from home uh I missing my family, which is my sister and my mother because I'm used to have dinner with them, talk with them about my day and all the stuff like that. And beside I would say that uh I miss uh the comfort what I'm used to, of what I know. Uh like the food I'm I used to it, uh the bed which I'm used to sleep. And therefore it could be uh very weird to be in above in another house uh in another environment uh with strange people and strange furnitures and stuff.
