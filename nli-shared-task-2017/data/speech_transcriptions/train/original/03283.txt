Last summer I was given the opportunity to go, to go to France and participate an organization in uh the west of France. This opportunity was given to me by the French Embassy. Uh I think this was a great opportunity because I had uh a chance to improve my French. I had a chance to meet new people. I had uh also the opportunity to travel in France and uh visit the other cities at the same <%> uh. I still uh communicate with the people I met there and I still remember the nice moments I had uh when I was in France.
