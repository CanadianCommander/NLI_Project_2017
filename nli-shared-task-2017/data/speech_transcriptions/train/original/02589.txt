I live apart from my family and uh I most uh I miss mostly my bed and my mum's food because uh I live in a dorm and my bed isn't uh my bed. Actually uh it's the something that the dorm has and I have to eat what the dormitory serves me so it isn't, that it,it doesn't taste as like my mum food. And I like being with my parents uh so I miss them they helps to me to deal with the problem in life and I miss this.
