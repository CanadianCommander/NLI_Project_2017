The book I have read is a book of Omar Pearson about India because in the last summer, I spent all summer in India traveling. This book I appreciate it a lot because I can afford all the issues about Indian society in the last one uh in the fifty sixty years of India history. Uh the first issue is about social and threats about religious uh organization of society and the second one is po- politicians um men in particular Gandhi. Gandhi is the major politician person about India in the last century and change completely.
