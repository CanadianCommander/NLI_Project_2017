Most I think my parents most because when I'm when I'm home it is the who take who take care of me a lot. Um for example my mother always you know cook for me and take care of me and my father always ask me how how am I going, how I'm going when I'm at school. Um and he really does care about me. So I miss them so much when I am away from home um.
