Usually I'm not a homesick person but when I'm away from my home for a long time after a while I start missing um more like the atmosphere of home, places that I know, places that I fond of. Um some sounds and noises. The um the smell around like the um the smell of flowers or trees from my garden. Um obviously friends and family um yeah it's more.
