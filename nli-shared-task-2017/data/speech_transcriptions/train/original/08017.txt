Well I have to work very hard to pass a French test in my own study, that was because I wanted to make an internship in France and Paris. And um in the end I also passed but it was very important to me because I love France very much and I also like the French language. However I think French is a very difficult language since it has a very wide range of grammar and vocabulary which is difficult to learn especially for German people. But anyway I studied very hard and that's I succeeded in the end I guess, yeah that's it.
