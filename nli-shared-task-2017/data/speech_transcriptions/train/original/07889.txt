Uh the cities in my country that I would take visitors to would be Marrakesh or Agadir which are the most popular uh attractions for tourists in Morocco. Uh Marrakesh mainly because uh of it's very famous market culture <%17.0> and I would take them to the markets and show them the more artistic side of this country as well as uh the more uh the beautiful architecture in the city which is mainly uh actually it's called the red city because it's painted red. I would also take them to the city of Agadir because uh as well as Marrakesh it's very popular for tourists. The hotels there are very nice also.
