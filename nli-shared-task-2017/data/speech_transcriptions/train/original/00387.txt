The thing um I miss the most um about my home is uh the food uh in my country uh especially during um festivals. Uh for example, um now is the um the <%> day in China uh <%> festival in China and people they are typically eat <%> during this festival and however while I'm in Singapore, um uh <%> are not as available in China. Therefore uh I miss <%> a lot. And secondly, for example new um during new year uh new year time uh we eat dumplings and this this and something rarely seen in Singapore so I miss this uh very much.
