Well, uh when while I'm away as I uh miss most the food of my country because it has got a lot one food and richest food but of course friends and the family because the support that friends that gives you while you're living in this world is is very important for me. And of course my girlfriend who who knows and who knows me very well and um guides me and drive through, to the right direction in my life. I also consider my friends uh one of the biggest point of view when missing while I'm away because everyone is important.
