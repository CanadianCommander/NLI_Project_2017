I'm reading now a book which I find really interesting. The title is Das Parfum and it has been written by a German au- author. I think it's really interesting since I have been living in Germany for one year so reading a book from an author coming from Germany was, is really funny for me and also because the story is located in Paris which is a city that I have visited a couple of times so I know it pretty well and whenever there is a description in the book about a street or, or about a building, or about a neighborhood I really feel like I am there again and I really enjoy any description about the restaurants or the style of life there.
