Well for me once I'm away from home I think the most things that I miss most would be  my mom's cooking. Well um actually my mom was a good cook well um especially her curry chicken oh okay, that was awesome. The curry chicken she used actually curry chicken is local delicacy in Malaysia which is my home. So if I was to leave my country and do som- somewhere abroad to study or I think the food is the most things I most miss most. And besides that I think that my mom makes great dishes too especially chocolate cookies, the chocolate chips. I guess I will have to miss <%> to to US.
