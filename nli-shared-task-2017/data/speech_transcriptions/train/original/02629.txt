The accomplishment I achieved is that of winning a national gold medal in national roller skating. And this accomplishment  was something which was very important to me, firstly because it was a sense of achievement, it in-built in me the confidence and the belief in myself. Secondly a lot of hard work went into it and achieving this success was very very important to me. Then I had to prove myself at the national level among all the students from various nations and it gave me a lot of pride in myself about myself and brought in me a whole new personality I didn't know before. I felt like an achiever, a strong achiever this was why this accomplishment was important to me in all aspects of my life.
