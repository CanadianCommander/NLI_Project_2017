Once I'm away from home the most things I miss most about home are atmosphere, my family, friends and acquaintances. Um and other stuff like food, um my mother cooks the best food in the world so i really miss it when I'm away. Uh while I'm away I also miss the company of my brother's dog who is um I'm quite close to. Yes that about it.
