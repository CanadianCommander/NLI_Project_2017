The accomplishment, the accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the f- my during my engineering course during the fifth semester. That main reason for the accomplishment was like I had a very low GPA of nearing two point eight and I had to improve it immediately. So I had to work right from the beginning of the fifth semester and it was a real hard and tough job to get through the subjects there in the fifth semester and this was the most difficult among all the eight semesters. I had to struggle a lot but finally I had made it by getting a very good score of three point five six on a four scale, four point scale GPA.
