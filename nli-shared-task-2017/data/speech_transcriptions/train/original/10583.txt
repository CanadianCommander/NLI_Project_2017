An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the preparation of Olympiad examination after my high school. I choose this accomplishment as the hardest as it ideally took a lot out of me. I had to really work hard day and night. And why I can say this is important to me was because it laid down the foundation for my career ahead. It laid down the roots as what I'm I supposed to do and what I'm not supposed to do. It showed me the inherent qualities that I have to work hard to understand the basic concepts about Maths and Sciences and an ability to choose my career properly.
