<%> is the most when I'm uh far away from home. Uh obviously what I miss most than anything else is my family and friends. Um I call them all the time asking what they're doing and as well, I mean I miss a lot my mom's cooking and the food, the Spanish food because when I go away I used to go to the to foreign countries and I don't in the the food in there isn't as good as is in Spain but most of anything my family, my mother and my father and my dog as well.
