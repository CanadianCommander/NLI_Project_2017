The last book I've read was on chauvinism around the world. I uh, I like this book very much because uh it presented uh artists' uh works on uh chauvinism in, in different uh uh peoples uh in in Australia, in uh Am- America and Asia. And uh, uh then this uh original uh writing of the scientist uh was uh commended by the author uh to put.
