A special opportunity was given me as a dentist when I was working um in India. I was ge- I was asked to be um uh a leader in a dental program that we conducted for school children to teach them about preventive dentistry. Um I led a team of five dentists and uh we went to each school in my city and uh we interacted with young children and uh made them aware about um, about preventive dentistry and uh showed them with models and it was a very inspiring experience for me to be able to teach and give something to the community, from my side.
