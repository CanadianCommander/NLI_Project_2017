I like to read love novels because it's romantic and it's not realistic in the real life and also it's imaginative because the in love novels it's never become true so you can imagine whatever you want. Also it's romantic because the way that they describe in the love novel you can think any romantic way to um have the relationship between each other, the male and the female. So I love love novels.
