I lived in a very comfortable room, I remember the food that I eat which I miss the most and I usually miss <%> that I get from my parents. Uh those room is the relaxation that I have and <%> that I sleep in and most of all I miss my parents which love so dearly. I also miss my sister and brothers who make life so simple for me. The person I was uh miss the most is my mother, I miss her the most <%> every year in my life.
