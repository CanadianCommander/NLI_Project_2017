I think the special opportunity which was given to me is that I have got the ability to um to went to a foreign country, for example, Germany. I was born in in China in Peking and if I haven't got the possibility to go to Germany I would have grown up there and haven't got a so bright and good future like I have now in Germany because school education there it's, is much harder than here and um I think in um in China you will have not so much possessions and such rich and you are not so rich like in Germany or in other European countries.
