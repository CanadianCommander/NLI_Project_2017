Oh I like to read I like to read the poetry in my free time. Um in poetry it is fun to find out others heart and emotion. When poetry is written the other, author usually reflects he or his thinking and emotion. Um another reason is um I'm enjoying poetry because it's similar to songs. The poetry creates rhythms by repeating some phrases.
