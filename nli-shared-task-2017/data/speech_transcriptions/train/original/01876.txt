Well this accomplishment would be scoring good grades in my chemistry subject when I was in the twelfth grade. Uh I was always weak in chemistry since uh since third grade uh and I had had troubles with chemical equations and other related stuff but in my twelfth when it was really important, I had to score good grades to get into a good institution. I really worked hard on chemistry and I dedicated two whole hours uh almost everyday for the subject and uh eventually I uh when the results were out, I scored a ninety three one hundred and that was a really big accomplishment for me, and I was really happy with it.
