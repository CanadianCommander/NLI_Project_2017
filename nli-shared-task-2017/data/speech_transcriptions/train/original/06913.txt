The special opportunity that <%> is to come to the United States. Um and it was really special to me to come here because of course the job opportunities was much open and much wider. And also the the healthcare was much more better than what I had in my home town which was provides simpler place for us to live to know that we have a good healthcare with, especially when you're working and help us insurance to sometimes feel more safer um than than to be uh in your hometown and you don't have the, the same healthcare. Also it's a very good place for children to um have safe places to play in like parks.
