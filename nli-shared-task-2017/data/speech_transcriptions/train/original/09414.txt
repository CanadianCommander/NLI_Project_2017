If friends of mine were coming to Paris, I think I would take them to uh significant places like uh <%> or <%> um because it's um perhaps uh what you heard you can hear about France uh abroad. So that place first and then the uh the place where the French, other view is uh um shown as in theater or a good restaurant. So my friends could have a good glimpse of uh what is a typical French uh life and um after taht the countryside I think is good uh too.
