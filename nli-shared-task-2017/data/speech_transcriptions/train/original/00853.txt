The accomplishment tha- uh the accomplishment I'm going to talks about happened when I was twelve years old. uh I obtained a gold medal in a national mathematics competition. I I have worked very hard  in order to achieve my achieve my goal because this is a nationwide competition and uh questions are also are all very high levels. And this accomplishment here is particularly important to me because that was the first time I have ever won such a big prize and it boosted my confidence and kept my interest in mathematics up till now. Like I still remember the hard work I paid during that training and the patience guidance offered to me by my teacher. All my consistent work paid off for I receive a golden medal during the ceremony.
