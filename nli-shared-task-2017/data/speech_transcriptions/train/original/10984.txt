If I had a friend from other country, and I will recommend them to go to the Kyoto because of the following reasons. First of all, Kyoto has a lot of traditional culture places to visit so if the foreigners want to learn about Japanese history, Kyoto is the best place to visit. Uh secondly, uh Kyoto has uh very beautiful sceneries and also Kyoto has a lot of cherry blossom. So, in spring the many people enjoy seeing the trees and cherry blossom and sceneries. So I recommend the Kyoto to visit for foreigners.
