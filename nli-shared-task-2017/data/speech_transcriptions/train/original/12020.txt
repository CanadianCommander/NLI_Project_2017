Uh what do I miss mostly at the moment I'm away is specifically about because I'm living in international country I'm an overseas student and I live in Peru and I miss mostly about all the my home cooking and everything from my family because it's a different culture where I live right now. The culture that I miss far away, far away from me is very different and my culture is what I miss the different people they have, the different responsibilities that are even though it's the same city the same town where I live right now.
