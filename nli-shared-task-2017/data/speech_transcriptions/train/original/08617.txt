Uh my achievement was to <%3.1>, in America. I lived in America for one year and actually it was really challenging that um, the thing that why it was important to me, it was uh, I worked really hard to get a good grade at school. I always read many books, many vocabs, and I memorize many words. Uh s- I try to make as many friends possible and try to you know be as active and I, as out going as possible. So I think it was really important to me. You know it's like learning a new culture and fitting in a new environment.
