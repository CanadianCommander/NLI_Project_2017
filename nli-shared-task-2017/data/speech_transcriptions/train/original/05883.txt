For me, playing the guitar has been the most important accomplishment and achievement in my life. Playing the guitar has been very difficult and immensely hard working. Because it requires playing different types of difficult notes and playing them in the correct tune. If one is not able to do so, then the entire song goes hey wire and the tune is lost and the song appears to be somewhat played from a very broken guitar. Indeed playing the guitar has been very difficult but it has helped me to blossom my personality in different ways.
