I think the most important quality for someone to work in a group or a team is that they actually are able to help each other and uh, so that they can, they ask when they have a problem and they also help each other uh when they have a problem, so that it's not, that it's actually team work and not that everybody is working on themselves. Furthermore, I believe that it is important uh to be uh ver-, to be very friendly uh to one another so that uh working is, that it's uh, that working can, that they can work uh yeah. So I think that is very important.
