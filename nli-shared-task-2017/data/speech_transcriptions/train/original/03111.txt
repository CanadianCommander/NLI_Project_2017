The book I'm going to talk about is uh Cold Hotel By Arther Hadley. Well um the thing that I like most about the book is that unlike other books it gives you an in depth analysis of of of the topic it is talking about that is the hotel about the running of the hotel about how uh how much <%> goes into uh running a hotel about uh the subtle things you know which you would otherwise not even care to uh care to even notice. And uh the  be- the thing about he book is that it is uh very descriptive and uh when I say that I mean that it is.
