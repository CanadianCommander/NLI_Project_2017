The book I most recently read which was very interesting was the Burns Guide for G.I.E Preparation. This book was very important for me because I had to prepare for the G.I.E test to study in the U.S. And yeah it was an interesting book. It combined all the mathematic skills you need to use for this test and all the verbal skills and I think without this book I wouldn't have made the test preparation. So I think this book uh was the most important book I've read to prepare for this test.
