I read three interested book about the families in the Middle East. I saw I think that the family in the Middle East as you know all the family consist of uh husband, wife and children. The families in the Middle east all the time the husband is working uh outside and the wife uh staying at home raising their children, helping them to study and help to get uh very good education. The family in the Middle East it's different from the far and west east.
