Well last year I um, I um, I experienced um that uh an an a humanitarian association uh was looking for some people to to move to India to build two houses. And so I um, I thought it was a special opportunity to go that country to help these people and to discover a new culture which is really different from uh the French culture. And it was also a good way to develop my uh qualities.
