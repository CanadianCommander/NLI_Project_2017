Uh well in my school um I was given the opportunity to create a club called CTRM and uh because my school is an engineering school and computer science, uh I created this club on, on softwares and so uh people are able to go to this club and borrow softwares and install them in their computers. So when I was given this opportunity it was really great for me because I was allowed to have my own room and I had computers in it and uh it was really great to give me this opportunity because now the the club is really successful and that is uh that is a great thing for me and the students of uh my school.
