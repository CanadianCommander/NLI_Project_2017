If friends from another country we're going to spend time in my country that is Germany I would tell them to go to Berlin. Because in Berlin there are so many sight seeings and there are so many clubs and bars and cultural awareness. Like you can go to film <%17.4> or you can go to theaters or the cinema and there is always something going on and it's really really great. Uh I would say they should go to Hamburg or to Munich because you see the difference is between so, so Germany <%35.7> just one country has so many different things to show. Yeah that is what I would do.
