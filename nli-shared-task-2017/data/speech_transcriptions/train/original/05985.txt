The things that I missed most about my home when I am away is to see my friends uh and my family, because they are all persons who are important to me, and I can't see them when I'm away. Uh the fact that I can't be in my home is a problem too because I like it. It's it has an atmosphere really peaceful and I like it, so I like to be away but I like time I can go home.
