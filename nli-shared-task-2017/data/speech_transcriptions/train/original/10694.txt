First of all uh one of those things I miss the most when I'm away from home is my friends of course. And then uh of course my family, my parent and my dog and, but besides that also my house just all my, all my stuff, my things are uh something I really miss also is like waking up in the morning and opening the window and seeing that landscape not something and seeing uh trees and and the uh the river and stuff. I miss going to my church with my friends and with people I grew up with and seeing the people that know me that I know very well.
