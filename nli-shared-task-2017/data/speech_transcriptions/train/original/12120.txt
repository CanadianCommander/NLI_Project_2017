Now that I am away from home, there are two things that I miss the most. The first one is silence. When I was at my parents' home, I was living in the country and now I have to live, because of my studies and my job, I have to live in the city. And this is really weird to not to be in the silence any more. There is always some noise but the the cries or neighbors or everything. And the second thing I miss a lot is my mother cook cooking because I'm a really bad cook and my mother really loves to cook and she's a really good cook and well, now I have to order pizzas and everything in order to eat and not have my mother's cooking.
