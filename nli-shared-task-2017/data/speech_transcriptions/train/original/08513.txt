If I uh could have any job or any career I would choose medicine that is exactly the career I'm I'm serving right now. Um I like a lot because, because uh in this career you can help people um. You can uh do a lot of things for people and and that's uh could help them have a better life, and better and be- and uh and better quality of life. Another thing important about uh this career is that you have to put a lot of effort to be a good um doctor. That's why I, I like.
