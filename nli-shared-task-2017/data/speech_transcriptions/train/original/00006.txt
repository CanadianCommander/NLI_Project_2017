A thing uh I miss most about my home uh is uh when I uh study abroad uh I f- feel uh concerned uh a little bit uh become homesick uh because uh I can't eat my mother's uh cook uh food. So of uh because I like my mother's uh food especially curd rice so I can't eat uh curd rice that I want to eat and if uh uh I feel uh I miss my ho- home.
