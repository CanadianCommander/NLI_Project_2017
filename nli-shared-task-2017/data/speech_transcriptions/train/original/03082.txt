I was given the opportunity to travel to China with my job. And I really considered this as a great opportunity and an important one because I I got a chance to travel to the country uh get to uh see how the country looks like and get to know the culture uh see what are the monuments and history as well as from the business standpoint I got to meet with Chinese businessmen and I got to uh deal with Chinese coworkers and see how they conduct business. So I really believe that um uh having my boss giving me this opportunity was an important one in my career and in my exposure in my business.
