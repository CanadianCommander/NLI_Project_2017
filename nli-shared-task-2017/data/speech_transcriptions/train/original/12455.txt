Uh the kind of reading material I like is newspapers because if I read newspapers I can get a lot of knowledge and get a lot of knowledge from the newspaper and also I can know what's going on around the world. That means I can keep in touch with the world and I can know what's happening. And from reading newspapers, actually you can improve your writing skills by reading a lot of topics and materials. That's the reason why I like to read newspapers.
