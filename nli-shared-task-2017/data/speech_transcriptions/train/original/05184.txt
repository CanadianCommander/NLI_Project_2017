The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the experience in Germany as an exchange student. There I um, I lived there for ten months and learned German for the first time of my life. It was very new for me. And I had to work very hard by going to a special scho- school for two days a week. And it was very important for me because I learned many things from learning a foreign language for the first time. And, and it made me communicate with much more people than before.
