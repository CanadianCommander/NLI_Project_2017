The most interesting book that I read till now has been the Da Vinci Code. It was interesting because of a few reasons. Firstly, the book describes about one of the stories that has, that we all can relate to. It describes about Christianity, it describes about Mother Mary, about the uh the heri-, the heritage and a lot of other factors that could actually act on what has been believed until now. I like the book specifically because of its racy details about uh engaging the audience, about engaging, about providing specific details about how it is different from the rest of the books.
