If I get  the chance I would just ask  my friends to visit Hyderabad itself because it got history of four hundred years old history and of course it it is a blend of you know tradition and modernism. You'll find lot of changes, technological changes in Hyderabad. It's one of the booming cities in India at least and history it's four hundred years old, you will find a difficult culture, difficult Hyderabad culture then and he might really learn from, can see lots of new things which which he has never <%> before and uh modernization, tradition. So that is a good plan for him to come and see the city Hyderabad.
