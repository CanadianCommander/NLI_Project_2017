My university is far away from home, when I leave home I miss my mother very much. My mother is a very important person to me. She's very kind and always took care of me and she is also a mathematics teacher. He teache- she teaches me a lot about the subject and the way how to be a good person. She told me kind is very important for a person and we must be kind to everyone else and uh eve- everyone else will treat you as a friend. Now I I was far away from my mother but I always remember what he she have said to me.
