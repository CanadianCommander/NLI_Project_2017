If friends from another country were going to visit um Germany, I would say them they should visit Hamburg because I think this is a very beautiful and big city. It's the second biggest city in Germany and it's definitely worth it to visit. There is the river Elbe and a lot of different um things to see and activities to do for visitors and I think um you can do a lot of things at in the city because I've lived there for twelve years and I know the people are uh friendly and they'll um welcome you. It's an international city, so I think um people from other country will like the city very much.
