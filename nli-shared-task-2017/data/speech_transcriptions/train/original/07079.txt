My school is very far so I need to drive there all the time and uh it took me like uh a month or so to learn how to drive but when I learned, I was uh very pleased and uh happy because driving your uh uh it help me and uh uh depends on myself and uh uh never rely on uh drivers uh uh or my parents to drive me to places to go.
