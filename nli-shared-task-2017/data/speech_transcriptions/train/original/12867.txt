Um what I accomplish I think I had to work very hard for was um learning how to take care of people properly who have a um who are um disabled physically or mentally and the I had to do that in social services when I did social service. So what I had to do was um of course read about things and read about illnesses and the special requirements you would have for treating people right and learn how to take care of people, how to clean them up, how to feed them, how to put them in a wheelchair, take them out of a wheelchair how to um drive a wheelchair around. So that was kind of hard to do but I loved it.
