Well of course I'll miss my family the most. I miss my little brother my sister, of course my parents and I'll miss my room, I like my room really. Uh I'll miss my food my mother cakes and food and just miss it when I travel away. Um I think also I'll miss my town, all of my friends all hanging around with uh and going to malls and movies too. So, and uh um the most thing I'll miss is definitely my family and they're um sitting with them in the living room stuff like that.
