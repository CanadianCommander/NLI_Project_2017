Just invited from a company in Texas it was really a special opportunity because I can present my research proposal and I can meet other people, other researcher and share my experience and share my uh topic with other people. I think it is really interesting. And I'm really like this uh presentation because I can get to know how to improve my research for example my research tools or the methodology I'm going to use. And after I have finish this presentation then I would know which part I should uh improve and I can uh make my research better.
