An interesting book I read about was <%>. It is a story of Uh three IT students and the strengths IT. It is about how they coco- cope up with the boredom of IT studies and how they also manage to uh ma- manage to get of on uh going on with their studies. So an interesting example to quote is how after the test they used to have uh their expertise on the uh college hostel. That was a nice that was very interesting and why I find this book interesting was that I'm also eng- engineering graduate and it also link with whatever was happening in my life. So it was quite specific in that respect.
