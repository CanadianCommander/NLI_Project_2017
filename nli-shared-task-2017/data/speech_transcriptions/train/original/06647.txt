Uh we are going to uh the most when I leave home is uh probably my family because uh there are the ones that are really important to me so if I don't keep contact with them I just uh get lost or very sad. The second will be probably my house because I am in a uh six uh member family and so we are the big family house with a really nice garden and a nice view. Uh so it's really okay that I like to spend time. And the final uh thing that I would miss the most is probably the <%34.4> the mountains because from my house we have a very nice view of the  mountain and when I go in down town uh in my apartment I just don't see it and it makes me sad.
