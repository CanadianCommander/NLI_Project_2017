Well, a month ago I was supposed to give uh uh my diploma exam and therefore I had to read several books. One of it was uh Molecular Cell Biology. It was really interesting cause uh this book was probably wr- written and uh it was actually fun to read it. Uh there were lots of information in there and they provided a good overview about all the topics and it went into details explaining it accurately which really lead me to a good preparation for my diploma exam. This was a really good choice.
