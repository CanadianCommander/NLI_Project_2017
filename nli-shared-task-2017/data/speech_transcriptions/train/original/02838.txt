Well first thing I would miss about my home is my parents. I love my parents ever since childhood, I stayed with them and maybe I would become home sick if I'm away from home. The secondly, I will be missing my neighbors whom I liked them very much <%> stay for for since my childhood. They're like more my family members and most and my added towardly, I miss is my pets. I I have dog, I like it very much. It was almost with me for some six to seven years. I like it very much and even miss the food what my mom makes because I, it may be it difficult for me to eat outside in the canteen food which may not be good and healthier.
