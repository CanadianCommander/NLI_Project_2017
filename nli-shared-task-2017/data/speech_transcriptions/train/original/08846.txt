When I'm away from home what I really miss is my family and the food and the services I get at home. Uh because at home you ca- everything you got served the way you like it but away from home you, you should make everything by your, not everything by yourself, but uh uh i- it's hard to be comfortable wi- wi- with uh with others place you are.
