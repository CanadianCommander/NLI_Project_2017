Uh I think it makes someone a valuable member of a team. I think uh this is something important to do in the. First of all, I think trust is very, very, very important, because if everybody trusts, everybody I think is maybe, is either to work with. And second of all, I think care about each other is important also uh because like, because we're human being like we need like everybody care about each one. So based on those reasons, I think uh trust and care about each other is important role in the valuable member of a team.
