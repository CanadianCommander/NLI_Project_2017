I will definitely bring her to Kobe where I am from. Kobe is a big city and its many building. Kobe has many buildings and also it is good place for shopping but also it has relaxation but there is beautiful mountain and beautiful sea. So as well as they can go shopping and have fun, they can relax, and also they can meet my friends and they can go where I used to live and stop. So I think she will like Kobe.
