There are many things I will miss when I'm away from my home. The first thing I will miss when I'm away from my home is my parents and my brother. This for example, I'll like to say that because my parents and my brother are the ones who have brought me up to this stage. The second thing I will miss when I'm away from my home is, my mother my mom's food. This is because I love it so much. Final reason I would have to say why uh the thing I will my home I will miss my home when I'm away is, my home the that that is which I'm living from past fifteen years. It is the home where my entire life has been occurring. These are the things I will miss when I'm away from my home.
