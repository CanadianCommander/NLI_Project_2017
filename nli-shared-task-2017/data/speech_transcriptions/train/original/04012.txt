What I really miss uh about home when I'm away is my friends and my city because I really like Málaga which is the city I live. Um and I really like uh walk on the streets and and pass and see the passersby and take some bears with my friends and also of course my my family always there at my home. So they are always there to help me and I I can go and uh wherever I want uh from that place. I mean I have all the things I can do.
