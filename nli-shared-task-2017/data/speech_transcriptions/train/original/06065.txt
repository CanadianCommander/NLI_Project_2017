The lake is filled with the <%17.0> and it's very luscious nature. Uh Udaipur h as a many monumental tom- uh many historical places to visit um big temples and it's, Udaipur is a very clean and neat city, it is very green in nature. There are many plants and Udaipur is a very peaceful in nature. And there are many pla- places to, for food.
