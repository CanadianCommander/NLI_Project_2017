I think the most important quality of a person to be uh a good member of a team it's the ability of work together, because in a team there are all of the friends, you're not alone, so you have to be able to work with other people and of course to be a, a kind person and uh to have facility to uh make real uh friendship and relationship with other people and to uh believe in a team about your group. And I think also it' important to be a sens-, sensible person.
