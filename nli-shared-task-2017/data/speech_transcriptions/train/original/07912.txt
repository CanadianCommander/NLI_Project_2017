I always liked to be an architect because I like to draw and see um see lots of buildings and um see if you want to be an architect you have to be good in math and I think to me uh math is challenging and I love math. And since my uncle is an architect, I'll have uh many great things about uh great things about being an architect. So I always liked to be an architect and maybe earn lots of money and help people.
