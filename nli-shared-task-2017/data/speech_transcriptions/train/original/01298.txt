The reading material I kind of enjoy the most reading when I'm free is magazine. Because they contain information which is precise and accurate and it generally contains, you can spec- you can specifically have a magazines of your own choices of different categories and they have information mostly in a chronological order which falls <%> calendar a month. It follows certain, it has pictures, it has visual effects to it, gives you a more impact on your mind and that's why I feel magazines are better we do.
