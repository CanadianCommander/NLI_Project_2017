Well, actually the last that I read was uh the, the, it's called, it's a novel and it's called Therapy and it's written by the English novelist David Lodge uh which is a contemporary author that I like a lot. And I like very much this book because it's really has a lot of sense of humor in his writing and uh it really attract me a lot, I read it like in one week. And it's very interesting the history about a writer and who lives in England, has an apartment in London. Uh he lives on the countryside but also has his apartment he goes with his lover once a week. Uh uh he uh he also has a wife.
