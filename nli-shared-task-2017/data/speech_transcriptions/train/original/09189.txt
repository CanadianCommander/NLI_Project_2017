Well, I love fiction but of all that I, I have read until now, the book that I like best is the one by a seventeen year old Harvard Scholar called <%8.9>, which is called <%11.8> life. Although the name might quite, sound quite weird but the book is really interesting and it teaches me how uh, lack of funds in your life can affect uh your studies. The <%26.2> uh book was girl who spend all her time studying and missed a lot on the things that are usually in does. She aims at being at Harvard but could not make it because she was not a complete teenager. So that, this book thus taught me to maintain a fine balance in life and be focused about achieving my dreams.
