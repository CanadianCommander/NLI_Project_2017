Well the quality I think it is better for a team is leadership. Because that will give you the uh the vision or the guidance where the team has to go. And gives you the proper advice to what to do and the functions and the policies and what you are doing good and what you are doing wrong and take you to another level of he organization in the organization. Uh other, I think the other one is the initiative because if you don't have, if you don't like to work you don't want to do your task it is difficult to to make that leadership going through so I think it is there are two not only one.
