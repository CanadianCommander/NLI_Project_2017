One of the most inter- interesting books that I find is The Kite Runner. I have just completed this book and it's a book written by uh Afghani writer Khaled Hosseini. The major reason why I find this book very interesting is because of the importance this book has given on relationships and how when one's relationship goes south it affects your mental peace and your ability to think coherently like in this book the protagonist of the book does not uh support his friend when he he's in need.
