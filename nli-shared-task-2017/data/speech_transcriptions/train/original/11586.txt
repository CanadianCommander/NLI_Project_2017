I could have any career or job I wanted I would want to become a doctor because of financial and ethical benefits I would receive. Uh financial benefits because there will always be sick people so I would be uh insured of a stable income and ethical benefits because of I guess the satisfaction you get by helping other people. And this I know because my grandfather is a doctor and he has talked to me about it a lot of times and he is happy that he is a doctor.
