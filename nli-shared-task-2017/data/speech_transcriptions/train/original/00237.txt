I would like to talk about uh the Chetan Bhagat's book called One Night at the Call Center. Uh this book will introduce with the challenges faced by the, the workers work at the call center especially during the night times. Because are, in under tremendous pressure, the families of this workers underrate this members compare, comparing with, comparing this works, their works with other engineers or graduates doing other software jobs. The time, <%40.2> of these workers also a very bit weird compared to the other normal jobs.
