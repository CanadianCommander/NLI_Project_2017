Hi, whenever, whenever I go away from my home the first thing I, I uh <%9.1> the first thing I miss a lot is the love and the serenity of my parents. I have a very friendly environment at my home. I always respect my brother, my sister and all my siblings and their warmth. The calmness and the soothing environment is one, another thing which I always miss in the hush life outside. Also is this, good food is another thing which I usually miss. Hygiene is another point which can be outlined and cannot be missed out.
