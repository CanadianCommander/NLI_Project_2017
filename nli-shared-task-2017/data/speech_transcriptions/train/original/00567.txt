I use a combination of all the reading materials like novels, magazines and poetry. Uh I use novels in uh situations that I'm traveling uh to just pass my free time uh or to or just make or or read stories what are there in it. And I use magazines in my work uh and to keep myself uh aware of the current events going on. And I use poetry uh because I'm a lover of a poetry and I like to read those especially when I'm sitting uh in a beach or in a place where there are good number of trees. Or or I just love nature and I lot like to read this poetry at that time.
