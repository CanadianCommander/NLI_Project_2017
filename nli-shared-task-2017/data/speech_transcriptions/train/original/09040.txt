One of my big accomplishment was to get my engineering degree in uh industrial engineering. Um it was really hard to get it because I had to go far away from home, far away from my family. I'm from Morocco and I had to got to France, so I had to um get used to a new culture and also work hard for an engineering degree. Um my first days, my first also in school was really hard because I had to get familiar with all the people of the, of the environment and all this culture that was not really new but different.
