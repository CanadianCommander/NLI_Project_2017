I had to work in my hometown for one month in August and it involved a lot of work. The first characteristic of this um job, accomplishment was that I had to get in touch with a lot of people and that involved that I had to be nice and stay calm for lot of the time. Furthermore I had to be really focused on my work and in getting the phone and getting emails to to clearly adopt the time tables and the reservations made by the client. These are the two characteristics of this job that made it, make me work very hard.
