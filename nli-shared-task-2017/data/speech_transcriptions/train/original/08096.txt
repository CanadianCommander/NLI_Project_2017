One of the main qualities I will like to have in a member of my team or in a person team is honest. Honestly, it's a main factor for two reasons. First, it helps to deal with people. And second one, it helps to face the way you face a problem. In first place, it, when someone, people is honest, this is <%22.6> among each others and relations are better and thus with the effort of the team is better. Secondly, a honest person will be always honest in what he thinks about an idea and therefore he will not have his poor opinion about something, and therefore will have a better love for the team.
