When I en- when I enter middle school my mother talked about my future and if I was going in the future what I would like. She told me to work very hard, study very hard. Until then I didn't really realize the once I had a great result on my test then I found out that I can do it and made me confident. So I think from then on I w- work very hard because then I know, I knew I could do it.
