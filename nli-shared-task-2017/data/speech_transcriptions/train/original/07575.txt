Apparently when I have a guest like my friend trying to uh see my city, I prefer to uh go and take him to a historical city. And take him to uh most uh famous museums that reflect our history and our uh uh famous uh information about our background or culture, and all the interesting that he likes. And also I keep in mind uh what uh things he put in mind to see, and of course I will be a very nice guide to represent my city and my history and my culture.
