Well definitely I would recommend this friends to visit uh the south part of Mexico and also the pacific coast. First of all the south part of Mexico uh would be very interesting for them to go because that's where the most uh historic uh buildings ruins, some pyramids are. And uh you have great weather and people are very nice down there. Uh while they are there they should also go to Cancun, which is one of the best uh in Mexico. After that I would recommend them to go to the Pacific coast Mexico, which is a place in Mexico that has the best beach and the best weather and uh great food out there as well.
