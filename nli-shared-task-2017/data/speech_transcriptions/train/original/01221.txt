Okay, the place you'll visit in my country depends on the season when you'll be coming here. Uh if you are coming here in the summer season, then I will I will suggest you to go to Antaly- Antalya uh because uh we have in our country, there are lots of faculties juristic places to see, to visit and to spend your money. And also the sea is well, the weather is good and you will be uh liking to stay and finish your whole day there. But if you uh if you are coming here in the winter season or a colder warm weather, uh you should choose Istanbul and Ankara which are he cities.
