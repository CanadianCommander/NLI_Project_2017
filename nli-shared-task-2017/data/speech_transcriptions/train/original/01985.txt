Um to go to graduate school in the United State well required me uh the a bit of hard work to accomplish um because the graduate school I wanted to study in is, um I want to major in Public Relations and Public Relations is really requiring in the the English ability. So going to graduate school in America and majoring in Public Relation will be a very hard work for me to accomplish.
