I've recently being uh given the opportunity to uh transfer to like Canadian University. Uh I think it's a great uh opportunity because uh Canada itself is a city full of opportunity. It's a place where you're given a lot of choices and uh a lot of uh like opportunities for your future to widen your horizons. And uh of course it's a new city so Uh I'm going to be exposed to um a new culture. And I'm going to be dealing with new people so I'm going to learn how to uh communicate or interact with uh different uh kinds of people, different cultures.
