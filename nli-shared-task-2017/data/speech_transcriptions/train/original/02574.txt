I feel that uh group coordination is most important quality that should be present uh in a team member, uh this is important because getting along with people uh is good. Very much affected by uh the ma- manner in which uh the person coordinated with the group. Uh this will allow the group not only to be uh very good but also enable the group to be distinctive. Uh I would like to say site an example <%> I could invoke uh responses in other group members to work efficiently and hardly, this I feel is very important.
