I think a very important quality is to be responsible. Responsibility is very, very important because you are going to finish all your you and you are you're going to finish and uh uh and collect all your goals. Otherwise, if you don't have responsibility you are not going to keep the goal. You will have a lot of problems to organize and especially uh if you are responsible, everyone will have uh some task to do and to prepare. However, it uh it's not the only uh quality that we must take into account to develop but we are able to summarize if you're also uh responsible, the successful the success of the group is done.
