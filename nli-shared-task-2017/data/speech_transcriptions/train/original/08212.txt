One of the most important opportunity that I had in my life were, was when I was in the <%> school. In the primary school I was part of the of the gymnastic team uh thanks to this opportunity I can go around my country and know a lot of people and I know different kinds of food um improve on my social um abilities in general. So tha- I think that was really really one of the biggest bigger opportunity in my whole life. I will love to be there again but I know that time happen and it's really hard to to back back to the past but I would love to do it again.
