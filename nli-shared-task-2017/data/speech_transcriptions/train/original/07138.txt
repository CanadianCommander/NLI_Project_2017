To my friends that comes to visit Spain, I will tell them of course to visit Barcelona. Because I think it's a wonderful city that has uh whatever uh people a person uh needs to have a great time. Uh we have shops we have a culture architect of beautiful architecture. For example La Sagrada Família or El Palau de la Música Catalana. Barcelona has also the bitch and the mountain so it uh everybody can have fun in a place like like Barcelona. We have lots of theatres and lots of popular culture too.
