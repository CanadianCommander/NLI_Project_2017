I think empathizing is the most important quality one should have as a member in a team. I believe there are many people in a team who are sensitive about various issues. Now these issues when one is in a team should be careful about. One should be and one should be and one should empathize with others as to what he wants and I mean what they feel about a particular topic and the way they want to be treated. Now many issues such as cultural issues things uh and other aspects come into place hence empathizing is probably the most important aspect when I I when you are in a team, thank you.
