The accomplishment that uh the accomplishment that required me very work hard to for getting passing an undergraduate course and for it wasn't another by getting the degree I can get the job in some companies so that I can stand on my own legs and so that I can provide uh I can give some money to my pare- I can look after my parents. So um I think this is the most important accomplishment for me uh I can get a social position, I can get a position in less social the I struggle <%> getting the undergraduate certificate, because that was also very hard.
