Reason my character and my goals think the entrepreneur <%> career is the most interesting for me, uh there are several reasons for that. The the first thing I can think of is that the economic upside is unlimited really depends on and your skills and much hard work you put in and also you have a lot of flexibility compared to other careers. You can schedule your own time, um you can take a vacation if you want to and uh and of course satisfaction, personal satisfaction is much more because you're really working for yourself, for your own company as opposed to working for someone else and you're you're own boss, which is the best motivation I think for any job.
