The things I miss most about my home and my when I'm away working is my family, brothers and sisters. I also miss my friend who have been there and who I've lived with. The main uh thing I miss is the friendliness and the cooperation and less professionalism of the people living in my hometown. The place where I live now is more professional. I also miss the protection and the concern of the parents which I don't have living outside the home. I live in a joint family and so I also miss my grandparents and my uncle and aunt. I miss the kind of society in which I live when I'm at home.
