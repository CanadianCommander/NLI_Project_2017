The accomplishment uh that required hard work of myself was my masters which I had to take in order to get my bachelor degree. It was uh uh uh a test which was oral and I had to learn four weeks the whole stuff and the themes were very difficult because the mathematical material was very difficult to understand and thus very difficult to learn and thus I had some problems. But finally I passed the test and I got the bachelor diploma.
