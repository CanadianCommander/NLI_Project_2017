Well, an interesting book I've read is Nineteen Eighty Four. It's a classical literature and I think it shows how uh government has complete control over the people can affect the whole society and I think an-d the connections of uh feelings that a person will develop in isolation uh will be constrained to what the government says and such a situation uh complete control. I think uh freedom is essential and this book shows.
