The most thing that I miss about my home when I'm hav- away is that um I miss my parents, the other one who has take who take care of me. Um and also the local conditions they might vary, the cultural uh the cultural expectations that people expect of me and other such things. One more thing that I may miss is my friends. Um many of my friends um may not be living with me uh if I go away from home and some and reside somewhere else. And one more important thing is that uh in the new place I may not be comfortable able to adjust with the addresses of different places where essential items can be bought. These are the main things that I miss about my home.
