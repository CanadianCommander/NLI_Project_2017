The thing I miss most about uh staying away from my home is the food I get at my home. When I, when I'm not at my home uh usually I have to either eat outside which I don't prefer or uh get my own cook and uh get some food. Secondly I miss the comfort which is provided my home which I don't usually find outside say in hostel or if I'm in a tour. I also miss my family the most because I don't have them around me to console me, to be with me to share my happiness or anything of thought. I also miss the kind of infrastructure that I, that I had at home. All these I miss a lot when I'm <%43.4> my home.
