I read a book on uh, I read the book uh Trojan War recently and I liked it very much because the book resembles very much to Indian uh mythological stories and it particularly it resembles so much about Ramayana and Mahabharata where uh Ramayana like <%26.1> Rama and Sita are as man and wife and Ravana uh takes away uh Sita uh in, by force but in Trojan War it is not so. And then I like uh the way it ended also and how <%43.2> was brought back to uh Sparta.
