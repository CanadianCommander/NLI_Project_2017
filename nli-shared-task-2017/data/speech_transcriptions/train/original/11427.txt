When I was in the high school I was in the middle of my class, and this was uh uh hard thing for me, because all ready you're friends. Uh because you that sometime your friend would uh re- would deal with you as a friend not like as a leader. So they want to make their decision or make what they want. So it uh it's very hard to compare between all the friend and to compare to like a leader. And some time it can cause many problem like uh I had to loose some of my friend <%28.7> because uh I can't differ over it actually, because it was very hard. And also it can made some problem between your friend like uh if you take some objects from other and multiply with the other one. So that can make many problem between them and can d, divide them.
