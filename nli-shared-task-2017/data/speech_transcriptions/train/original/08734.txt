I think that working or coordinating activities is the quality which is very essential for any uh team member to have. This quality will enable uh you know many of us. Suppose we take an example of a project which needs to be done uh while graduating, now if one of the, the members has this quality of you know having networking skills and coordinating skills, he'll be able to keep the entire team working together at one time. And he'll be able to maintain contact with each part of the team in order to get status of what is, what is happening and getting things going rather than people just working separately as each individual entity and not coming up with uh quality work. So this will avoid repetition of work and it will be a very systematized process of working. So that's why I feel this quality is important.
