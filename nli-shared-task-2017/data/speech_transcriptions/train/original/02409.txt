A very interesting book I read recently was uh The Young Earth. It is a book that uh mainly dea- deals with the <%8.6> the creation, the creationist model, it means the scientific model that takes into account that uh all the things were created by God and not uh uh uh uh did not evolve over a long time. And it mainly was about geology, what kind of evidence can be found uh in the, in the earth, in the rocks which we see today. How they can be interpreted and why some interpretations of evolutionists are clearly wrong and how they can be interpreted in the lights of the creationist model and it was really interesting to see new ideas and how old ideas can be overthrown.
