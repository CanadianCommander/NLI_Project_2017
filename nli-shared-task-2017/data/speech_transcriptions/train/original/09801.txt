When I'm away from home I most miss my friends especially the friends at the Doodle Training. I can't Doodle Training in other places too but it's not the same as with friend. And I like sport very much so in another place they usually on test possibilities to do the sport I like. And citing for example I don't have much mountains when I'm away usually on my bike <%26.1> I can't cycle in another places. It's so difficult to transport a bike.
