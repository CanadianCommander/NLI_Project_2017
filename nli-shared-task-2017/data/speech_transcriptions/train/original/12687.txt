A very interesting book that I have read is called <%> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It is written in Spanish since my mother tongue is Spanish, we have prac- been practicing for my uh graduated program. This book is really interesting to me because you know <%> since the beginning, but is still you read it and you go along with the uh main character of the book, to find out what happens, how did he get to that end, um to actually discover all the hidden <%> uh features that lay behind this dead since the main character is murdered since the beginning of the book you already know who has murder him, why <%>.
