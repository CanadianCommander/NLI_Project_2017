The thing that I most, uh miss the most when I'm away from home is uh being with my parents and how can I miss my home, home-made food. I actually I'm not livi-, presently I'm not living with my parents. I stay in a city other than because of employment reasons so I can very well uh say that it is something which uh every person who stays away from his home would miss. Like when you have to eat out everyday, that time you miss. When you're alone at home you, that time you miss being with your parents, having the home food and spending good time with your parents and uh family. So this is what I miss most when I'm away from home.
