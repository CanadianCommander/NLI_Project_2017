I really think that I never had uh actually a special opportunity. Uh in the sense that uh what I've uh uh reached uh at school or at any level, at work it's uh done by, by my own. And uh I I I had, I haven't had any special help by my family because they, they, they cannot uh help me in that sense. And because we are uh three children, uh I mean three son and all of us have his own problems and.
