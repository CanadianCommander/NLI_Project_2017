I want to talk about uh read a book, I mean that I have read when I was in high school. It was book uh written by Agatha Christie, the title was um the, the <%13.9> Express. I love it because there is a lot of suspense uh, it is a story generally about a murder. Uh someone who has commit murder but you know uh, who it is, who you suspected uh everyone but not the real murderer. So there is a lot of suspense uh that's why I love it. Uh you know um the murderer at the end of the book. That's why it's a um special book.
