Of course this is a very important thing that I was given and uh I was given that by um uh an election that was made throughout the high school. And um I got the opportunity by uh the people that elected me to be the head of the student council at my school. Um this is very important because uh that will help <%> that's, it will help me um get into a good university probably and hopefully. At a, it wa- it's not something easy that anyone can get and.
