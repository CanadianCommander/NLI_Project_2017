It has got very mu- very much number of tourist places to visit. It also has got historical background this was ruled by a famous, <%27.3> famous king by name Deep Sultan. He is one of the greatest off- office time that I would like my friend to visit Bangalore, because it has got many places to visit, and administer about.
