Um a couple of day ago uh um I was given a book on architecture and um I rea- I re- I read the whole book and I found it really interesting um because um is um you get an idea of how stars influenced each other and and stars evolved and come back sometimes and um for example um the Greek star it it it was in the ancient culture and then it came back in the renaissance and then it came Greeks after revival and that was really interesting.
