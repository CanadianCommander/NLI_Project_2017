I think the quality makes someone a valuable member of a team is the skill because I have two reasons. Because the skill is an important quality for team or do a member to have. The first of all for example the basketball games we there are five peoples have here are five peoples to play the basket ball. But if one has one doesn't have uh skills he can not help with a with the achi- with with each other so it is very difficult.
