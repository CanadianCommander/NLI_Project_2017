When I was away, I miss uh some of the things for instance my mummy's food and the comfort at home and the, the safety feeling that I'm feel during uh while uh I'm living at home with my parents. I'm living apart uh from my parents during my studying abroad and m,y the first thing I miss is my mum always prepares the food for us. This, I miss her delicious food. And also in my, at home I have my own room but away, when I'm away from home I have to share my room with my people and I miss the safety feeling because my parents are always with me.
