I miss many things about uh my home when I'm far away. First of all I miss my family, we're a very close family and uh the fact that I can't see them really makes me sad. I also miss my friends um our parties, our gatherings um everything I used to do with them. Definitely I miss the places I used to go when I'm in my city, uh the walks throughout um my very loved um native city and um I also miss the food specifically the typical food um my city.
