One of the biggest achievements that I've done so far uh accomplishments that I've made so far is I cleared to join in this examination for the IT. I had to ou- work very hard for this because it was it is one of the toughest examinations in in the world. Around two luck students write the examination and only like two thousand student are tak- are selected for it. This was very important for me because for at the end of that short level ITs are considered as the best institutes around the world and this is this is like the basis for uh for any engineering student to go of course uses as the instrument to go higher in life. And then it gives uh a very good knowledge base for all undergraduate students in engineering.
