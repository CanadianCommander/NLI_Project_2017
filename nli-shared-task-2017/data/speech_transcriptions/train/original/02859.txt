I was given an opportunity uh when I was still in China to uh visit a Scandinavia Scandinavian countries with the Chinese press delegation and this has been such a eye opening experience for me. That was, that happened um in early nineties and uh we interviewed uh so many different organizations in Scandinavian countries to understand about their social safety net system. And uh when we came back, we reported what we have interviewed uh and we published articles in the newspapers. It's a wonderful opportunity and and I really <%> opportunity to see a different cultures.
