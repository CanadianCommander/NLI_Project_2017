I think it is very important uh for someone to, to listen to the others to be a valuable member of a team. Uh because uh in a team the most important thing is the cohesion and uh to have cohesion you have uh the, the members uh listen to each other uh speak to each other and look at each other. And uh I think uh, uh without this you cannot have a team working out.
