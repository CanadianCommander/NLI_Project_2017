Okay I think that the most important of a person in order to be part of a team is uh cooperation, because you want to be part of a team, you can uh, you have to stay  with a lot of people and you have to play for example uh, uh baseball matches ro do things and you have to cooperate with your uh partner or with your uh, with your team. Without cooperation, uh you cannot play those matches, or you cannot stay with a lot of people. And because of that, I, I think that uh the most important quality is cooperation.
