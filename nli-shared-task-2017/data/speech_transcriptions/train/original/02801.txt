For me, I prefer the kind of books in which the fiction is the <%> role. Uh in fiction or novels, we can think beyond our limits. We can uh express our fantasies of what they in fiction and they will be a chance for our mind to be become flexible so that we can uh go for variety of ideas and uh uh some of my favorite books are Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter. And they are so adventures uh which we uh can do, we can dare to do but uh but we can experience that we can meet. Well uh just it's a fantasy.
