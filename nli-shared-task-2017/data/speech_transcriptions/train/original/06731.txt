Actually I'm gonna miss my whole family my mother, my father, my sisters, my uncles, all my family because I used to live with them uh my whole life. So when I go away from them, I feel something is missing um, uh something is missing, I don't feel that I am uh the time con- any comfortable. I used to live with them so that, so that uh I don't feel comfortable. And actually everything is here but <%44.1> nothing.
