When I'm away from my home I miss the parents mostly. I miss my parents their care, my mom's food their guidance. I miss everything. My parents' guidance is the most important thing to me. They guide me in the proper way. And I miss the culture I miss the nature of the beauty, I mean, I miss the nature, I miss the culture, I miss all the neat frontier.
