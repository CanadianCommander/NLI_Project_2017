Well actually I prefer uh all three, all three uh uh mediums uh novels, magazine and poetry. It depends on the time uh I have uh free with me. Uh I like to read novels in the long times I have because um uh I don't like to uh to uh cut it. Magazines uh mainly novels on vacations, magazines on the weekends and poetry uh in the weekdays during work 'cause it's short and uh uh full with inspiration.
