An interesting book I read uh it's Charlie and the Factory's Choc- Chocolate. Uh this book it's uh a very ni- uh nice and in my opinion it's good uh for children but for adults too. Uh because uh he needs the writers' is displaying the is displaying the important uh of rules. Uh so if you uh respect rules uh you can have a good result in the life. And uh so this book uh uh it's important for everyone.
