Uh that is uh to choose that job because of my uh current job is a marketing assistant in a uh, in uh accounting firm. And uh my job is to um i- is to organize some seminars or co- or conference or something like that. And that really give me much fun. But, but uh I think it, it would be much f, uh it wo- it would be more funny if I work in a PR firm cause that is what they really doing, and uh I will be.
