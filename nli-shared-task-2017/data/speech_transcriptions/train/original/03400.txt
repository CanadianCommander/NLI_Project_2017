While I am away from my house I miss many things. Uh like uh the first thing that I miss most uh are my whole family, my sister, my parents. Then I also miss my bed when I sleep because it's very comfortable. Then also the weather I have in my, in the city I live because now I live uh far away from my house. But the thing uh I miss most maybe the food my mother cooks. He's a really good cooker so is make really fantastic meals and well uh the meals uh away from my house may be good but not as good as my mother, my mother one. So uh that is the thing that I miss most.
