Well if you ask what do I miss most about my home when I was away. And my answer is definitely my mum and my dad. Because mum and dad are the most great, greatest person to me and they brought me up and they gave me their love. And they are so important to me. And in nowhere can you find two people smiling at you always and tolerant whenever you make any mistakes. And there's just so good. And they are, they are more often and, and I mean they always cook dishes for you. And in nowhere can you eat things better than that. And I miss my parents.
