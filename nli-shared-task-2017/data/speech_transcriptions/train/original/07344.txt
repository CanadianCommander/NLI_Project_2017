When I think about a special opportunity that was given to me I think about the opportunity that offered to me after my graduation. And after my graduating from college I was offered a job at a marketing department in <%> Corporation. I like this opportunity because I can use my knowledge in my major to applying to my new job and I really liked the marketing department because uh I can have a chance to contact with different people. It is imp- it is good experience.
