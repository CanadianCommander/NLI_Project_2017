I came to America by my fathers job when I was the age of five. And when I came to America, I received many opportunities different from the students in Japan and students in America. Because I could speak Japanese and English which I'm both fluent in. And these two opportunities gave me to, to be a person who I could express and explain my culture in Jap- from Japan to my friends who are Americans and then from Americans.
