The last book I r- uh I read is The, The <%3.9>. It was translated into many languages. It is about a boy and a girl uh and a boy who falls in love with a girl. The gir- uh the girl is actually a woman, she is much older than him. Uh there uh is because of that there is a conflict between him uh uh and and later in the book the, the girl is uh, plan uh is uh uh is as officer in uh the <%35.8> and uh the conflict between the boy and the girl is that he knows that she can't read and uh he has to.
