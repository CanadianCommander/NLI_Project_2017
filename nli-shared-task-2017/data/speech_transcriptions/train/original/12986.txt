Just have been one year since I'm stay away from home. And what I miss most is Christmas with my parents on one side because they provide me with love and affection and comfort and warmth on a daily basis, something with is very necessary for an eighteen years old girl trying to build herself. She needs the comfort of others surrounding her to help her go through that stage. Um the other side I also miss my friends and the southern friends um mentality. In the sense that friends help you get uh friendly environment and that is missing for me in Paris. And same uh happens when I'm studying abroad. Those two values I miss most.
