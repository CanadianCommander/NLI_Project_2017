If I would have any job or career I would use to be an IT manager for a hospital. Because for, it is actually for two reasons. First of all I'm a computers science and I graduated and also because my part of experience is in medical IT. And third in studies I have a good uh opinion about the hospitals and what they need to get uh and in a new technology, uh and also how hospital information system would be done.
