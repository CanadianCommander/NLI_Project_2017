I would definitely prefer reading magazines in my free time because uh I don't have that um then to watch poetry and novel because magazines, you know what's new, what's going around you and uh it widens your horizon, not limiting yours view to a particular area that wide your idea of uh material it contains. Of course magazines may tell you about some uh they're selling novels or poetry that you may go on for it, but magazines are of course my choice when and I want to read in my free time and uh that's what magazines are <%>
