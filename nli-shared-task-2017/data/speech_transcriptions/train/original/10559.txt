What I miss most about, about my home when I'm away is um the my mainly my brothers and sisters. I have one brother and two sisters. And I'm very close to them, we always discuss about our important issue and they are uh really good <%20.1> for me, they help me a lot. Uh another thing that I miss when I'm away is the, the good atmosphere uh of help in the house, because uh, uh when we are a fa- uh a family who is has children as of course everyone has to help, and it is a very good atmosphere.
