If friends from another country want to spend time in my country, I would go with them to Berlin. Because this is a city which is fa- very famous for its museums, and the history which um were there. The culture of Ger- of Germans, you can see there are very well, because there are a lot of um stores, which are very famous for Germany. Um in addition, I think it's very good to um bring them there since the, um the public transpo- trans- trans- transport is very well organized there. Furthermore, it is very cheap to buy things there or to live there. That's why I would bring them there.
