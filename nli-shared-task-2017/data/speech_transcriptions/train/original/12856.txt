If friends from another country would come and visit my country, first I would consider geographic aspects, cultural aspects, gastronomic aspects also and uh the art and history included in my co-. I would take them to the capital first uh to see this, where they could see the ocean is Cartagena. Would also take them to Medellín where there is a lot of uh art and history included. Uh on the cultural aspect, I would uh take them to small towns for example where they could meet uh the old customs of my people. That's it.
