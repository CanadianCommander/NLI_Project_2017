I most like to read the magazines in my free time for example I'm really interested in cars, and mo- modified parts so when I have free time I choose to read the auto car magazines so in that way I can learn the special details and the new developments in that technology or in that industrial system or otherwise you have another option in choosing the magazines like you can quit magazine when you want because it's not like a novel or it's not like a poetry you don't have to finish. You can leave it or you can quit whenever you want. So I mostly prefer to use magazines in my free times.
