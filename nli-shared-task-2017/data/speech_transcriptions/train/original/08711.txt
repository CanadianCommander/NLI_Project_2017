Um when I am living alone in a foreign country, uh when I face difficulties then I will have few people to talk with a- with about the difficulties I face. At that moment I will, I will think about my, my parents and their ways to help me overcome my difficulties. And uh ano- uh another time when I, when I miss my parents more than normal times.
