I miss my family the most when I'm out from my town or from my home since I'm staying with my family. And we're a joint family we're staying all of us, my uncles and aunts and everyone, so it is a very very big family. And when I'm out from my home I really miss them because I don't find their company with me. And even if I have to make the kind of decision also I cannot, I cannot made any kind of decision without the presence or without the uh without their presence. So I really miss them drastically, also I miss the environment what I get in may home with you cannot get outside, I miss my house.
