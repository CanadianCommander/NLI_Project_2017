What I miss most that um my home when I'm away is the peace and the quiet that it provides. I come from <%9.2> which is a nice city in Belgium and uh I live in a really peaceful neighborhood there. So what I miss when I'm in a booming city like London is um the peace that I get there. What I also miss a lot is my family, I'm very close to my family and I have a little four and half year old sister and I miss not being able, not being able to see her grow up and um not being a, able to hold her and talk to her face to face.
