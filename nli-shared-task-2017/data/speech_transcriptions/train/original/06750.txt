An interesting book I have read was Julius Caesar and it is about Julius Caesar the emperor of Rome who took over Rome after he defeated Pompey. I found it interesting because uh it contained a lot of drama and characters whose personalities changed. For example Brutus killed Brut- killed Cae-, Julius Caesar because he thought he was doing it for the good of Rome and uh he was actually just helping the other people to kill him and all they wanted was power and in the end Brutus kills himself and uh realizes that what he did was wrong.
