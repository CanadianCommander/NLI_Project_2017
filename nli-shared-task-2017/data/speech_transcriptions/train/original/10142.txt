How the f- electronics are integrated into mechanical power using this automobiles and it depends on how you actually perceive things at first of an automobile, it ex- clearly explains what's, what do you need for your automobile to be fast and to have the power to run on the roads and how usually automobiles go, how they uh usually broke down.
