A special opportunity was given to me is coming to United States because I can play better quality golf in the United States since their programs and environments are better than where I used to live. Also I can learn a new cultures as I'm living with other peoples from other countries and there are a lot of people from other countries like from Europe, Asia so I can meet them in one place. At the same time, I can learn a different language which is English.
