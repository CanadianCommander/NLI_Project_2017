Um uh I will suggest you take her to Hong Kong because it is the country that I used to live there. So I I will be more familiar with this country and I can't bring you wherever you want to and Hong Kong is a place that very popular and lots of things that you can do like site seeing or shopping and eating. And it is a multi-cultural country so you can meet different um friends that you come from different countries and also it is a really small country but you can go everywhere you want to.
