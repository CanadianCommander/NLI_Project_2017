A special opportunity that was given to me was actually given to me by my parents and this opportunity was that they trusted me enough to allow me to travel alone with my friend to a country that I have never been to. This, this opportunity gave me a chance to grow and prove to them that I'm worthy of their trust and how I can manage to be alone because in co- I was going to be off to college in a few years and this opportunity showed them that I am capable of the responsibilities that are going to be held upon me. Um again this opportunity also.
