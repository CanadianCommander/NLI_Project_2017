When I have sometime I usually uh like reading news papers. Uh first of all because uh I want to be aware of what it is happening outside uh outside my little world and um on the other hand um this kind of reading is close to my field of studying. I study history and I contemporary history and I would like to to improve my knowledge also by um reading some uh stuff that is uh included in uh newspapers or magazine or um news on the web. Things like that.
