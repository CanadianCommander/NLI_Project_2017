There are many kinds of books that I like to read. Uh the first one is science fiction books uh because they for me they they stimulate my imagination they also uh help me to understand uh or to try to imagine the future. Um the second kind of book that I like to read is biography, biography of leaders such as uh uh India Gandhi or political leaders because it helps me uh also understand what leaders have in mind and the last one is eco- economical newspapers just because I like to uh to trade and to play uh on the stocks market.
