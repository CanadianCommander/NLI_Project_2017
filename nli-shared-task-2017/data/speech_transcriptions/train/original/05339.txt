In my free time I uh prefer to read comedy, romance novels in English uh scientific journals that um help me understand important issues about my studies and French poetry. I like to read these English romance comedy novels because they help me to relax and to have a good laugh and get away from my studies. I like to read um political political magazines such as foreign affairs uh because they help me understand important issues about my studies such as migration, nation building, conflict and peace, uh conflict resolution and peace studies. And I also like to read French poetry especially because I'm in a Fraco-German course and I love the French um.
