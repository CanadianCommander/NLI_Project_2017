I think at the time when I was at school I um I like to to read novels and and um poetry and um but now I think that it changed now that I'm at university I focus rather on magazines and sometimes I read also novels to relax but I think it is very important to be informed um about what is going on in the world and um as a student, as somebody who probably like to um have a post of high responsibility it is always important to um have information and to learn to touch um the the things that are happening in the world.
