I recently read a biography about Wins- Winston Spencer Churchill. It was very in- interesting for a lot of reason. First of all because I realized that Winston Spencer Churchill was not a good student. He had bad grades at school that it didn't impeach, it didn't impeach him to become a great politician. A politician who saved, I could say the life of his country and even more I could say life of the world because he opposes, he opposed the Hitler and the <%> and worn the the war. That's why I found this book very interesting and I can recommend it to everybody.
