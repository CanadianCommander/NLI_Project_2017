Um when I am away I miss my family of course and uh my friends. I miss my dog, kind of my girlfriend uh. I used to live in the United States for quite a while so I know the feeling, and uh yeah I miss my bedroom too because yeah, I feel comfortable in it, it's my home. Um I stayed in this house for twelve years so when I'm away I'll really miss it and uh, yeah I'd like to be with my family and have fun with my friend. And uh yeah, it's nice to be home when you're away. It's good feeling and you can relax. And I uh yeah I miss the food too.
