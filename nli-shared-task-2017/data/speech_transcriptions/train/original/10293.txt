The Fountainhead, this is the book by Ayn Rand which I have read recently. This book about objectivism changed my life, my thinking, my perception of life, everything changed. The book taught various aspects of life and the domination is one of them. Howard Roark, the character of the book exemplifies very well that, when, one, when the man knows where he is going the whole world steps aside. He, Howard Roark is again an extreme character and he's become my role model. His struggle was very inspirational and motivated me quite a lot. His in-depth passion for architecture taught me that passion is a very important aspect of life and then one should be very passionate about everything which one does.
