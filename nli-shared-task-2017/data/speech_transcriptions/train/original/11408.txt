Um the special opportunity that was, I had uh, I was um studying at the United States because um in my country there is no too many people could allow to study in the United States or the other, the other country because, because of the financially, some financial problems or um usually um my country's men has to go to army definitely. So a lot of people couldn't come even they want to. So studying in the United States is qu- really good experience for me.
