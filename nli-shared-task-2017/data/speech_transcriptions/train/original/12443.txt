I would rather prefer uh prefer reading magazines to novels or poetry because they are more of entertainment and news because and it does all what we need in this busy schedule and lives we have now. After a days work whole days work uh we need some entertainment to come down ourselves. So magazines are a means of entertainment. So and poetry is uh as I I'm an artistic person and I admire art, I prefer poetry to so that and.
