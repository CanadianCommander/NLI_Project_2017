One great book that I have read and I saw that it was uh very interesting is uh the, The Old Man and the Sea by the Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway. It was interesting in my point of view because it describes how genuine in life as the old man uh sails through the see. It is portrait as the our journ- as our journey in life and that it is full of challenges. Also what I've got from that book uh is that uh <%34.4> during his life uh is faced with many difficulties and challenges. Uh life itself can also be the nature uh.
