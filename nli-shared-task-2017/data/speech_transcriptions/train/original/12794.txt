I'm one of those people who likes to spend um their time at home. Um so I miss a lot of things and I miss a lot of doing things. Um and one is my, one of them is my computer because um I do most of my stuff in front of the computer. Also um since I cannot carry all my music collection with me, um I like to um browse through my music collection and uh pick one and listen to them uh in my free time. Also um some might find they're stupid, but uh I like to organize my Library um, uh and it is a fun thing to do for me.
