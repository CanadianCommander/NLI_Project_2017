The book which I read and found more interes-, most interesting is uh My Experiment with Truth, My Experiment with the Truth by, written by Mahatma Gandhi. Uh this book uh is generally explain the basic uh rule about the, how the one individual can uh beat uh anything in the life and any challenge without just speaking truth. In this the Gandhi has given an example of his childhood, where he was once scolded by his teacher <%32.7> because he told his teacher truth but then he was pleased by his teacher because Gandhi told him the truth and the teacher praised him because he was.
