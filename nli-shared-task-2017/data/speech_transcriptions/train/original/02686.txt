Well the accomplishment that required uh me a lot of work it was the French high school diploma that I passed in nineteen ninety two. It was very tough because of different classes that I needed to know in French language about math, physics, chemistry uh history, geography but at the end of the, of the semester uh I passed the test and I did it with a very uh high level uh marks. I was really glad and that was the best uh part I could, I could do in my life. It was a very good accomplishment.
