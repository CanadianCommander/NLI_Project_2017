Um my accomplishment was that I painted a wall of a restaurant it uh in my neighborhood. The accomplishment was important to me as I want to pursue in artistic career and that was a practice for me to and some recognition. Um I had a lot of fun doing it and it turned out to my satisfaction very soon it was called the three birds and I painted three birds sitting around the table just having a good time and I'm relatively proud of my accomplishment.
