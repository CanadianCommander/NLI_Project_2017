I I miss many things when I'm away from home. Out of the many things I miss I miss my parents most because they used to care for me very much. And the I also miss the home food prepared by my mum which I like most because I'm very particular about the food I eat. And also the friends around my home with whom I play, I loiter around and I enjoy gossiping with them and another thing I miss is my pet dog, which with which I play most and I spend most of the time. All this I miss because I'm away. These are the four things parents, home food, friends and my pet are the things I miss most when I'm away from home.
