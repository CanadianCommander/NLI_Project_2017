The last book I've read is the Harry Porter trilogy. It's one of of those great books available in the world. It's um it combines both fun and knowledge. It provides knowledge because it's uh it talks almost about everything starting from the generation of elves tell, uh you know the small tiny things available like you're using like nails and stuff like this. So it talks about the uh how how things are generated, how things are discovered. Not only that it talks about like the um uh uh how people reach to to these discoveries. So that it's it's a very interesting book and I recommend it for people to read and to go through it because it's it it gives lots of benefits for the reader.
