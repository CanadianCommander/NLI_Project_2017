What make me to work really hard was my studying in California to become a nurse, I'm a nurse here in Germany and I have family in California so I decided to become and work as a nurse in California too. And that was a hard path to go. Um I had to do a lot of tests, to go to college to do a lot of things that I um need to accomplish and everything that really made it really hard for me or put something in my way just made me to work harder or to believe in me and.
