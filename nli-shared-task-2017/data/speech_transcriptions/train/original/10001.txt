The most important achievement that I have made in my life it's getting the bachelor degree. I think it's I think it's the most the most important accomplishment in life because I started the first year with a grade of uh very good, that why my my aim was to be at the top of my class. So I've tried my best to study hard to to even so to using new methods to look for further references and to to to to look into the Internet for how other people think about the subject and to prepare to the exams very well until I get the this achievement. I think this achievement is the most thing I have worked in in life.
