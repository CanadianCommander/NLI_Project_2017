Basically in my free time I read uh both novels and magazines. I read novels uh because uh they are fantastic, because they create a new world based on what I invention. Um and when I read something I really uh imagine uh the contents in my head. So I have certain pictures in my head about what the author wants to tell me which is quite interesting. I also read magazines to keep up with current information with news and events for instance in the music scene or the movie scene because I quite follow, quite quite follow that um, so novels and magazine are the two kinds of of materials I read the most.
