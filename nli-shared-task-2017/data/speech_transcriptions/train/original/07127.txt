If I could have any job or career I wanted, uh I would like to be a doctor so I can help people, and I can make a lot of money. Uh and being a doctor that's something you know you learn every day, something is a doesn't end. So I learn everyday, I study and work at the same time and help people. Sometimes I might volunteer and helping people, that could be a nice job.
