A special opportunity was given to me was the opportunity to swim. Because when I was small boy when I was like five or six years old there wasn't many people around that could swim in the pool. And I had the opportunity to swim. Uh I was I was actually instructed by a private teacher. So it was a pretty much a real big opportunity for me and later on in my later years um I could swim in the sport team of our high school. And so I could make some degrees in swimming and also there are some adventures of swimming like your body builds up and you become more healthy. So I think swimming was a good opportunity for me.
