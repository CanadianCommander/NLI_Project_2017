If my friends from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest them visit Bodrum. There are many reasons for my decision. First of all there are many activities that they can do in Bodrum like swimming and camping in the forest. Another is that there are many historical places around Bodrum and they can visit this visit this places and this will be interesting for them. And last year uh my frie- a friend of mine came from Italy and I uh took him to Bodrum and this was really enjoyable for him.
