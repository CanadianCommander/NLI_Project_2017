If I have to choose one accomplishment that requires I had to go hand is the to be quiet. There are two reason why I think so. First of all, to to be quiet is very good for my uh to my concentration on my work very hard and for example, when I'm in library, I can very concentrate on the work and uh I can do uh very good <%> accomplishment. The second, uh accomplishment that I will require is so to have the reason.
