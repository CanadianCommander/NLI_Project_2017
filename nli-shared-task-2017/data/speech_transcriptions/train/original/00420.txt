Well, if friends from another country were going to spend time in my own country, I would suggest them to come to my place that is Hyderabad. The reason being the cost of living is very less uh more, more places to visit. And of course the cost of accommodation is very less because I'm going to accommodate in my own flat. And of course I will, uh for example uh if I want them to get accommodated into a well lavish hotel, it will cost him a lot. Uh they would probably plan their uh funds to spend on different things like purchases shopping and etcetera. They will, they need to spend all the money uh towards the accommodation if they stay in a good hotel so that leaves the.
