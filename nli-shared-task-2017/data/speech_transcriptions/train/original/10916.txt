My major achievement came when I was selected for a job that perfectly suits me. For this job I had to enter into an engineering college. My specialization was in electronics and I loved electronics very much. I made all the efforts to learn more and more electronics, get to research oriented and worked with best of the professors and tried to convince them to give me good projects. I tried hard for all my four years in my undergraduate studies and the result came out to be fruitful. I was selected, I was the first from the campus to be selected for the job and that was a perfect job for me in electronic instruments. Yeah, that was my achievement.
