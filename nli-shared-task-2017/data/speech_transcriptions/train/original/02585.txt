When I'm away from home, well the first thing I miss is the good meals my mother prepare to me, because when I am a lone on my own, I've got to prepare my own meals and they are not as good, well that's basic. But the other things I miss are my brother and sisters because I like to be with them. I've a little brother and a little sister, and I really enjoy having fun with them, spending time so I miss them a lot. And the last things that when I am away from home, I can't do all the thing usually do, which means being with my friends and going out to play sports of any kind, and I miss it a lot also, that's all.
