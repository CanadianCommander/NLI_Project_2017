I miss most um when I'm away from home, my friends and my family. Because I really love to be um together with my friends, because they are great background for me, and um they give me uh strength. And so um that's my family, because always uh if I have a problem I can come back to my family, and she supports me um with all her strength. And another thing uh I really miss is um my dog because I love my dog. And um I grew up with him, he's sev- now seventy year, seventeen years old, and um he really stands for my complete youth so, um I definitely connect him uh with my childhood.
