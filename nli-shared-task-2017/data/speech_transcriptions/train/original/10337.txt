The book which I recently read is written by the great Indian poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. This book, um the title of the book is Rashmirathi. This book I like most because it gives an idea uh about the um about the hist- historical event that had taken um that has been taking um um take place uh in ancient India. Uh this book reveals some uncovered truth of the ancient Indian history in form of poem and since poem is uh very interesting thing for me from the very beginning of my childhood, that's why I like this book very much.
