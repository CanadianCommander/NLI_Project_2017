The most important interesting book that I have read in the recent time is Da Vinci Code. Uh This book challenges the fundamentals of Christianity and it uh it mo- the story in the book it moves from uh U.S.A to the Europe and it's very thrilling and it keeps you in the edge of seat. It isn- uh it provides us a very very in-depth information about the uh about the analysis that the author Dan Brown has done on it and the ending is also very good.
