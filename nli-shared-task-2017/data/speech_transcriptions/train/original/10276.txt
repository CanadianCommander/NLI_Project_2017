There are many things I miss about my home um food, home food being one of them. My mom prepares very good food which I really miss, being uh being the student uh staying out of the city I have to face a lot of problems because this uh the food over here uh in the hostel is not uh that good, it's very spicy, uh compared to my moms food um it stands nowhere. Whatever mom prepares I love it because she makes it with care and love and uh this is uh thing I uh miss the most being far away from my home.
