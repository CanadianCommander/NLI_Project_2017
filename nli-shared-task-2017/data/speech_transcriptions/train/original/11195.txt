In tenth grade I read a book called The Giver, I don't remember the author but I found it an interesting book because he conveyed the ideas of having feelings and emotions for other people and how in a society with no emotions and feelings one could live. Um John the main character uh was taught the feelings of love, of happiness, of sadness and he was the only one that could experience these emotions. The Giver was like his professor taught him to not say this to anyone else. In the end of the story, he thought that people shouldn't live like this, that was a failure of to life and he can decide to escape from the society.
