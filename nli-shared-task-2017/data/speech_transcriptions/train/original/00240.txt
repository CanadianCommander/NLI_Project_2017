The kind of reading material that I will choose is magazines because I like them. Uh I like to read any type of um magazines whether it is computer and it's or anything. Why do I like this? Because I can concentrate on reading them and I don't have to think anything and on anything else. I just concentrate. I would rather read magazines over poetry or novels because um I can find a variety of topics on them and in each day, I can find different topics that I can choose from and they are very cheap compared to novels. So it's good. Thank you.
