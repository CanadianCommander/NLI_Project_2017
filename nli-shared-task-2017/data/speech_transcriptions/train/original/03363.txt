I've been away from my home last year more than USA for a year and what I miss the most was my way of life like going to bars, seeing my friends and I don't know, do stuff with my real friends that I know for a time and one of the stuff that miss the most was my turn tables because like it's my stuff. I'm a DJ and like listening music and stuff like that just make me happy and all those kind of stuff I couldn't <%> there so I missed it a lot. And what I miss the most too was my family because I I couldn't talk to them, I couldn't see them for important days like chri- as Christmas, as anniversary and stuff like that. So is what I miss the most.
