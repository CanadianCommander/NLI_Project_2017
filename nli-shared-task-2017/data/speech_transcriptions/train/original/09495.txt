Called Macbeth by Will Shakespeare. Uh this, this is a play and it has been reproduced by England books. Uh the book was really interesting. It uh describes how a person can change from being passive and being a good person and can change into being an aggressive evil person. And uh I really enjoy this book cause it shows the different characteristics of people and the way they react to different situations. And the book is quite, quite interesting because it does relate to history and is not completely based on fiction. It, it does have a lot of fact in it. That's all.
