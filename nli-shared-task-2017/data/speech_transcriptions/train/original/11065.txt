The interesting book that I have read <%2.2> someone, it is written by <%5.0>. And I think this book is quite interesting because it deals with the life of uh three students, three friends. The whole path in IET. It conveys  the message to youth, how, that is the way they need to uh utilize their student life uh and college life. And it even gives uh message, how not to waste the time and how can your life be screwed if you don't utilize your college life properly.
