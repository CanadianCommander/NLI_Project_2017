I was given an opportunity to gain the class representative of uh my school in graduate's course. Uh at that time I thought that it is not that good uh opportunity but I have learned a lot from that. Because of that I came an extrovert person. I organized uh several events and even I participated in that and um moreover it increased my communication skills to a great level and uh although um I used to feel shy in uh speaking and expressing my views in public but because of this opportunity I became a real extrovert person. And so being class representative for four years was very helpful to me.
