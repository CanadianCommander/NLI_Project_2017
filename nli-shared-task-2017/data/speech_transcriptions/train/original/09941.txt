Since I'm studying mechanical engineer the most one of the most cha- challenging uh requirements for me and one of the toughest challenges that I faced in my three year course was to pass this exam on machine design. And basically it requires uh it's taught for three semesters and then you have to give an exam and which you have to draw and uh uh you have a drawing section and a writing section and uh it's extremely extremely difficult and uh um I worked extremely hard for it for about three weeks and uh in the end uh all I can say it was a success and I did pass uh uh it was important because I get to continue with my engineering and it's good achievement.
