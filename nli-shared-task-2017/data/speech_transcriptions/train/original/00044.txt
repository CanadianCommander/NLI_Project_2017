Really the most interesting book I, I have read recently is a book written by uh a famous uh activist. He's an Arab. He's called, uh his name is Doctor Salman Abu Sitta. Uh this researcher and activist uh wrote a book about uh the right of return for uh the Palestinian refugees. What was amazing about this book that it uh, it let you know, know uh facing uh some uh simple facts and he answered.
