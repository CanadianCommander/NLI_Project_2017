The special opportunity that given to me um was uh to be a dancer in a famous company in France because before I wanted to be a dancer, a professional dancer but um for me it was really, really important because uh it was my dream to dance and to travel the world with all the dancers in the company to, to find and to find new culture and to meet uh all the danc- dancers with different technical from mine. Um I really, for me that was really very important but finally I refused because it's um, it's um.
