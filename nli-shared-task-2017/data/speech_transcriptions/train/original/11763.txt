One of the interesting book I have so far was a book by Paul Auster named In the Country of the Last Things. This book was interesting to me because if you reflected various kinds of humans you mentions and you could, you could imagine yourself in various situations that in normal life you can never ever, even talk about you could be there. Such as human desperation, excitement, hope. And it also taught, it also taught me how to, how to, the solutions, how to, how to co- how to resolve my conflict in my soul.
