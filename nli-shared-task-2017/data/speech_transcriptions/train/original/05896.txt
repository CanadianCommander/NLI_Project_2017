I like to read Bible because I was born as Christian. In the Bibles well I believe in Bible than than a lot of different types types literatures and when you read Bible you can learn a lot of things, a lot of new things, a lot of old things that you never realize or that you didn't know before. And when you read Bible it guides you and it leads you to better better life and better goal closer to God and I think it is and I like to read Bible because it helps me to understand God and get closer to God.
