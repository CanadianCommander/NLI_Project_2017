One of the accomplishments that I want to note is my uh PhD. I have a PhD in um in Engineering and of course there was a lot work to um achieve this. It's um highly sophisticated, the scientific work which you have to <%> to achieve uh PhD and you have to do a lot of writing and a lot of research. Um I hope that's um this accomplishment will help me in my later career and that's tha- that it may take or open doors uh for my uh for the professional career and allow me things to do which I couldn't without the the uh PhD um.
