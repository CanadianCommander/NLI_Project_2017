In my free time, I love reading I love to read business magazines. This is basically because I love to uh I would like to be a become an entrepreneur one day and in the business magazines it is full of  stories of people who are entrepreneurs and their success stories are written. I take them an as example and devise strategies how would I but how  to succeed in my life and how to devise a plan using their strategies. So it's very important for me to to uh take them as an example. So apart from this I do refer to some novels also and because novels are also a very important material where you can get some stories from life stories also but it's but which can entertains you. Thank you.
