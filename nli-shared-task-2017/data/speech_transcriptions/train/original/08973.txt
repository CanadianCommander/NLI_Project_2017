The special opportunity that was given to me is, I was given to serve, a couple of us to serve the community. And this opportunity was very important to me as I had proved myself in the community for e- uh as a physical therapist by profession. I hel- I have helped out the poor and helped the people to relieve that pain to some extent. And this has helped me to come up with more confidence and also it has given me opportunity to think that in the future I have to serve the community.
