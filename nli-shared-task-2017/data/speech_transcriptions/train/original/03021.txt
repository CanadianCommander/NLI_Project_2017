Uh what I miss most of my home when I'm away is definitely my mother's food 'cause she can make really excellent food that I'm not able to prepare and I also miss going out with my friends and going to places uh um and bars that we always go to and I I also miss um family members a lot especially my mother. Um and I also miss the places where I grew up and that I always like return to and and that's about it.
