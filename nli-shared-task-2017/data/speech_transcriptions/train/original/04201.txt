I was uh recently given the opportunity um to teach for one year some music classes in a public school. I had like uh I got like a long term uh substitute position and that was very good for me because I'm planning on becoming a music teacher. And getting this long term position um exposed me to um a lot of classes and it gave me a chance to learn about the curriculum that I had to teach. So it really uh gave me uh you know a lot of experience and I have been gaining a lot of skills from that experience.
