The thing I miss most when I'm away from home for a long time is of course my brother, my little brother, my mother's food because she is a great cook and of course my father because he's my best friend on earth and uh we have a very special relationship and of course my house, my room, my bed and all my friends, my grand parents. I miss this thE security, I feel at home. The love my parents give me and all the little details I only have in home. That's what I prefer.
