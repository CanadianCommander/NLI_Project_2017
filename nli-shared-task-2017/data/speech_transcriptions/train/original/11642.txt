The book that I found to be interesting was Harry potter's first edition, uh and the first read. I believe uh it was interesting because of the language that was used in it. It was very informative also the story line was very adventurers and it brought me back to my childhood days and the fantasies that are surrounded by uh childhood nature. For example the riding on the on a broom was an interesting adventure and passing through the wall was surprising enough. When I first read the book it was hard to understand the language but slowly I developed the meaning of it and it was easy to understand.
