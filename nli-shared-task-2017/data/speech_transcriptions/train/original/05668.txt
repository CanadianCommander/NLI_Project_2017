If I could choose any job I wanted to I wanted to be, I would be a sports agent uh greatly inspired by the movie Jerry McGuire. I like to follow my my clients to their sports games. For example I like to follow my if my clients to a Super Bowl and I would really enjoy watching him perform greatly in such an important game in front of a huge crowd. And um and I would also find great pleasure if I could find if I could support my uh clients both financially and both uh in mental in in and helping them.
