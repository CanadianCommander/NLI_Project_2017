Uh when I'm away from uh my home uh I miss uh most uh my family, uh my mother father and elder brothers because I uh spent uh enjoyable and beautiful times with uh them. I also uh miss the conformity in uh my home because uh I don't feel comfortable uh uh in uh anywhere uh um uh like home. Uh home uh is the best place for me to be happy and this.
