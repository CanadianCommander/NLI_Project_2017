Well, mostly I miss about my home when I'm away is the first the first thing is my mothers snore and the second one is bath. The first why I miss my mothers snore is that she's the best cook in the world and she just cooks what I like and there's the reason for I miss the bath is I can relax in the bath and I I can warm my body in the bath and that's what I need when I'm tired. So well actually when I miss my bath it's in case when I'm abroad so but I still miss it.
