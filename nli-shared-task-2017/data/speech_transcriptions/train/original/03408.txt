If I had a chance to choose my job uh I would like to be a singer. Because I would like to play guitar <%9.5> because of that, because of my habit. And I would like to give concerts to, to lots of people and go world wide and see lots of people and to see them to play the guitar. Uh I would like to be a singer because I would like to sing about, uh about the things that I want to that I want to measure very truthfully. Uh that's all.
