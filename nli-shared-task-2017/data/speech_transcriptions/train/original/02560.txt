I will choose to be a nurse and I will I do like to be a nurse because uh I like to help people in pain. People who sick to get, to regain their health. I think um every everyone in this world needs help but mostly the sick people. And um and if you get sick uh everybody needs helps to rec- uh maint- maintain their health. So um there is a lot to do in the nursing field and um there is always time and opportunities to do better for the people.
