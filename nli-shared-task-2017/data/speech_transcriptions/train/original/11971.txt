Well one one of the main qualities for a person to be a member of a of a team uh mainly the the more important which I consider is to to be a team player. Once you have that kind of quality, uh it involves also solidarity, it involves being uh a real part of the team or a group. You you cannot be uh really a um a team player and stay aside of the goal, of the focus of the of the group. You'll always take part in all the the work they are doing.
