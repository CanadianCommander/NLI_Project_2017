Last year I was given the opportunity to study abroad uh in Germany. This was for an eye opening experience as I discovered a new uh, a new culture new ways of living. Um and most importantly a new educational system which uh suited me very well. We were able to choose our classes more freely to attend classes uh which were more rel- relevant for our, for our future. And uh this was for me uh the best year of my studying courses and I am very thankful for having been given this opportunity.
