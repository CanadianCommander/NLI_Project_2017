I read the Oliver Twist. He's a he was a poor boy because he always no mo- he hadn't didn't have mother but he had with been helped a lot of people and it's, I it was when I read it it I was moved because a lot of people helped him and uh so so it was so sad story but the end of story is happy because he become happier than before on at young.
