A very special opportunity that was given to me was to spend a year in Spain after I finished my high school. This was firstly because I had the opportunity to learn Spanish uh beside English this is one of the most important languages in the world and for planning a career it's very good to be able to speak Spanish. Secondly, it was a great opportunity to get to know the culture of Spain um to get to know many different people from, from many countries. And thus this opportunity to spend uh almost a year in Spain was very good to make various very uh worth-full experiences.
