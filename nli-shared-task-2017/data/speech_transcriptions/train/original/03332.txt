I want to be a teacher since teacher is moral for education. Education is the highest goal everyone would like to achieve and education is useful for the whole universe. Teacher job and by by being the teacher, I can have a close relationship with students and with that I can uh extend my relationships among people. Besides a teacher is considered a second parent for the student and by this way I can advice students and treat them like children, especially if I'm not married and I don't have kids, I will be happy.
