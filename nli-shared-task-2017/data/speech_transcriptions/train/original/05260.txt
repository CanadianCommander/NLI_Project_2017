An interesting book I've read uh I guess it's uh The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald. I think he's uh he's a great writer who is very descriptive and very vivid in what he writes about uh especially in his description of uh the main character Gatsby, Jay Gatsby. And uh he's just this crazy romantic fool who's after uh Daisy, if I do recall correctly. Uh she's beautiful and he'd do anything for her and uh he's just so romantic. Uh it's, it's fundamentally about the uh the jazz age of the US, in the mid-nineteen something and uh, oh my God.
