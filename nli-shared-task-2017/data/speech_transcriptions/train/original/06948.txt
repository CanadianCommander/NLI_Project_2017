I have been here for six months. It's a great and big opportunity staying in the United State because for me and Colombian people it's really hard to obtain um the American visa. So it's a big opportunity for me. Two 'cause I'm studying English and I live with Ame- American people and they can show me uh all about all could about the culture in in America. Uh I like stay here.
