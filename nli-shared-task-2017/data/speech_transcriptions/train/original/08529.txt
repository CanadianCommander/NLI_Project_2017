First of all I would suggest to my friends to come to Caracas where I am from Venezuela. They will um I will recommend place, places like the beach, Cubagua is a very nice beach in Venezuela it has very, very pretty views. I recommend uh a restaurant near my house called <%23.8> which is a place where they make Venezuela's typical food and uh, and they talk to you about that a little bit. And I will tell them to visit some of the museums like the museum of central of Caracas which is a museum of historical development of my city.
