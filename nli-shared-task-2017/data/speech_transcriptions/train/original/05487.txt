The interesting book I've read recently is uh Angles and Demons written by the written by Dan Brown. Uh the story is set in Venus where uh where murders are murders are done at random and the hero of the book Robert Langdon too uh investigate the case as he is uh symbol specialist. Uh aiding him is a is a woman who is a scientist and uh in their search for the murderers they through they go through very interesting facts around uh surrounding Venice and ultimately there's an interesting interest to the story uh which involves which involves the pope of Venice and this finds very interesting to read because of the facts and not only the blood because of the facts also.
