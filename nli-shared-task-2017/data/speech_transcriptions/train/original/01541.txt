In my free time I use novels as my favorite kind of reading, then magazines as and as the last kind of reading that I like is the poetry. Well first of all uh I like the novels because uh you can read good literature and also read a good history and it takes you to some of the world's realities that you can see. Then the magazines you can know about current topics. And the last one is poetry because I like the the way it's structured.
