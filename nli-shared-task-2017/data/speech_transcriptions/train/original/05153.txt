I personally would like to read uh materials during my free time. I personally like to read magazines during my free time because magazines uh just provide short articles about topics that I'm interested and due to my limited amount of time and all my acade- because of all my academic responsibilities, I don't have time to read over long novels or poetry which is hard in meaning. So I tend to read magazines which has short articles and I <%> they convey a message to the point and I get the message quick. The same with news and newspapers. They're in the same category.
