If friends would visit my country, I would recommend them to visit Rome because because of it's history. Um you can walk down the street and there are also everywhere uh uh museums and uh exhibitions, it's very interesting place. Another point is that um its life um um another point is that, I have lots of friends there that could um show us the city from another way as just going to city. It's always better to know somebody in the city. You get a better approach to the city.
