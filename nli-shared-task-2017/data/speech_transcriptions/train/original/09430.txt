When I'm away from home, the most the thing I miss most are in fact uh my wife because I like, in the evening to meet with her uh to prepare the cooking and then to spend a nice evening either by watching telly or uh simply talking. Definitely another aspect is also just feeling at home which is a feeling which is difficult to explain but it's just being surrounded by <%> that you know uh not being surprised, never be in a hurry uh and never be dependent on other person's life, for example in a hotel.
