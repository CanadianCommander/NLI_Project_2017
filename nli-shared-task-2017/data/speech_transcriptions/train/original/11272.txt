Since I'm from a town that's <%1.6> I miss the most the beach. I love the beach, I love sunbathing and I love just relaxing and chilling there with my friends. I also miss the views I have from my house because my house it's in the ninth floor, so I see all the bay from my window and I can also see <%20.5> from my house. I miss that's <%23.1> and I also miss people because people there is very happy is very open minded and they don't care what you're doing, anytime you can do whatever you want and you do not have to worry what will they be thinking the next day. I also love it's it's weather.
