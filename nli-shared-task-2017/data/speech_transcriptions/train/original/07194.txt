When I am away from home I always miss to sit with my family and talk with my father about many issues. I always miss to sit with my little brother to talk to him, to talking about the school and what he is doing in school and how he's doing his subjects. And I always uh miss to uh sit down with my little sister, she is little and I would like and I always like to help her in her subject and in her homeworks to make her understand everything. And of course uh the most important thing is sitting with my family and having the uh conversa- conversations with them. And uh that's all.
