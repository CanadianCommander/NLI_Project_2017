Uh last year I went to United States. I spend there one year studying in an American high school and that was a great accomplishment for me because I've never been abroad. I've never been away away from my hometown. So going there was a great deal for me and I had to study hard before going there because my English was not that good. So studying was a big task for me to do. After a month, I went there and I had to deal with new people and new experiences. That was hard but unhappy I'm happy because I finally got it and I got home with new experiences and new stuff.
