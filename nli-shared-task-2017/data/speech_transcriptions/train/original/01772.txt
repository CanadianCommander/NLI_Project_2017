I like to read uh novels such as killer novels and spy novels uh because they usually have very good endings and uh they covered a lot of you know uh interesting uh story lines and plots. And um uh usually spy novels also co- contain information about a lot of countries and you know what's happening between those countries. I like to read a lot about that uh you know with story line as a background. Uh coming to magazines, I like to read lots of uh news because uh I can uh find out you know about the current uh goings in the world and you know gain perspectives on various issues. Uh I don't like to read much poetry.
