Um the interesting book that I've recently read was um by Philip Roscoe called Terry Man. I I I find very interesting because um it mainly dealt like the protagonist was a was a quite old man who um yeah who has uh family problems for example and everyday problems of ordinary man. And um he gets older and older and sort of his his whole life is um is described in this book and um in the end his family um is sort of destroyed and so it's it's like interesting to see that other people also have problems.
