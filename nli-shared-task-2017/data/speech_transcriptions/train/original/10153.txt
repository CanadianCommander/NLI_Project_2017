I think I would probably choose to be a scientist. Um in my opinion uh being a scientist is quite a noble call. And uh most of the scientist have but, but not for the most part they have good pay and would care to do research in uh any <%19.7> in, in any field I am interested in. So I would say it's more flexible then or maybe a job in a company in which your primary thing is to make money. So going deep in, in addition to those reasons uh a good scientist can instruct others <%39.6> in his field of research which I think is a word against word.
