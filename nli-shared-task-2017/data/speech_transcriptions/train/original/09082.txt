The interesting book uh I have read is uh on uh JG Ballard, I don't remember exactly the title but it's very interesting. Is about from the politic. And uh he gives uh special ideas about society of nowadays. Is talk about people getting mad about uh public center that giving them uh special and uh, uh a lot of choices of uh information of uh, um customer service and uh something else. And so the work is really fantastic but uh also very practical and very close to our reality.
