Uh when I go, I think that what I miss most is food because I, I lives in Japan and like the food is like very good but in Switzerland the food is quite bad so I miss the food very much. And I also miss my friends like since in my primary school because when I go abroad I'm kind of alone and I can't really see them often. And also I miss to go to shopping because I, in my school I, I couldn't be able to shopping like I really do if I were home so.
