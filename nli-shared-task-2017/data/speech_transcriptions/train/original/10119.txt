I would like to become researcher um I'm not sure whether or not I want to become a researcher about a technology company or a professor. In anyway interested in <%15.2> my major in science and I'm really interested in those topics. So why I choose a researcher as my career is that, my job is going to be something that I'm interested in which means I earn some money at the same time I enjoy my career. So I think the most important thing is that to enjoy my career or job to enjoy myself because job is so significant.
