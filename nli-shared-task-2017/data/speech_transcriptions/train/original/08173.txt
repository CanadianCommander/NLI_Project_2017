The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was basically the organizing uh process of technical festival that was supposed to be held at the college. I was suppose to prove my organizational abilities as well as my ability to work the team. Because I want to apply <%> and um that was very important for them to evaluate whether I could work the team or whether I was a good candidate for uh applying to the school. Um it it made me uh reach into my inner self and actually ask myself how I can ask help to uh improve certain situation work with other people. It was very important because I had to prove my worth to the school that I was uh a good candidate to be admitted.
