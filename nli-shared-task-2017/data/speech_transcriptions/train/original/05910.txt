I think one of the funny things that you most miss about your home when you're away are that you're being at home mostly complain about. For example stereotypes about Germany include um accuracy, punctuality, all the people are not so friendly and not always open their arms for you but if you're away and you miss these things and you always wait for a bus, well if very many people great you and invite but you never <%> is really mean the way. Um you think you you wha- wha- wha- the things you you didn't like didn't like at home and then it's like that.
