The interesting book I have ever read is The Little Prince who wrote by the French writer. It concludes uh philosophies or or stories. I think it is the most beautiful uh storied I've ever heard. Uh it deal with something like the talking rose and the fox who raised by the little prince. I this interesting because it feels something I can't <%> uh I can't understand for a while but after every time you read about it, you have new <%> of that. So I think it's the most interesting book I have ever read because um I think it's full of some things new.
