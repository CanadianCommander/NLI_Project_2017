The most thing I miss about my home when I'm away is my family. When I'm away from my home I can't even see their face and even it miss they self. And this is the, the second I miss my musical instruments. I play the guitar and ca- uh piano and music thing, music means very important to me. When I'm away I can't play them and I miss them. And also I'm um, I'm a guitar collector so I miss my guitars very much.
