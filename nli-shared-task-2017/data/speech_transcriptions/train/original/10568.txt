What I mostly I miss when I go away from home is my mother we have always had a great relationship, we've alw- uh and I can speak to her about everything. She is always there when I need her to try and help me with my issues I have never had any problems thanks to her advices and I hope that it will always stay this way because I think thanks to her support I will get very far in my life.
