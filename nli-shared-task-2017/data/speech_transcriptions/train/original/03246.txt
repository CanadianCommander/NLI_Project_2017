I would suggest my friends to uh, uh for my first countries, the city of Montreal uh because is, it's the biggest city uh, Canadian city in the North, North East. Uh there is much to do there uh from seeing the uh diverse cultures uh whether being Italian, Greek, French, English, uh Portuguese, or Lebanese, there is from all kinds. Uh, uh there is also uh an older area where the uh first uh colonist came and settled, which is very nice and uh very rich in culture. His, this will have.
