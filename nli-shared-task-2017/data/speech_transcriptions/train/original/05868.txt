Although I'm really interested in poetry and reading books, I don't read that many books voluntarily beside my study because I have to read for science, for example. So many uh assignments and books so that I don't have the additional time and don't wanna spend my free time on something like that. But what for me is especially important is to read the newspaper daily to get informed about politics and I also need it for economics to knew what is happening in the world.
