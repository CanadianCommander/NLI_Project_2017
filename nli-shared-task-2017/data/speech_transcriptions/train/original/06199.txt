Well if a friend of mine would come to Berlin, I would recommend them to visit Berlin. It's a f- uh to Germany sorry. Um it's a very diverse city and Germany has a lot of interesting things to do, a lot of in in opportunities and there are a lot of funny things you can do in your leisure time. Another thing I would recommend is Munich because that's the October fest. I would um recommend them to go there in October or September when the October fest starts because that's fun and you can meet relative different people from various countries. And the third place to visit is definitely Hamburg. It's completely different to Berlin. Berlin is actually my favorite city, but still Hamburg is very nice to see. It's very luxurious and very um.
