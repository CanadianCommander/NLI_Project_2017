When I'm away from my home, I miss company of my family members most because when I was there, they used to encourage me when I'm down and they used to talk about a variety of topics and I was I used to get really inside abut every topic. And now I miss those points and I miss the company of my of my mother who and her food which she used to cook very well. So this is the second thing I used to miss most and apart from this, I used to, I used to miss uh my further advice on various career topics, that's all.
