As a team I think the most important thing is the cooperation, I mean like in a team maybe some people have more <%> than other people do. Like in the basketball team, I'm interested in basketball, it's like <%> star game he is like a star player in our team. It's like the ball always passes the star player but the star player can make the ball very well and make the team win. So I think the cooperation is the most important. Number two we can say the star players as normal as the other players. Maybe in the other team they are the same and but in real team they are like we have to have a center, we have to have a star, things like like collaboration and build star. I think that's the team.
