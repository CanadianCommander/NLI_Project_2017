The thing that I miss most when I'm away from home is the food. It is the most important uh substance that any any human really need. Uh especially the taste of the food that is made at home is just uh very good because the food made outside has too much of oil and spices in it. Along with that taste of the food and the quality, the company also does make a lot of difference since eating with the people who are most new and new to you matters a lot. It somehow changes the perception of the food that you're eating.
