My special opportunity uh that was given to me is that uh I had uh a lot of opportunity  to go to different countries such as  Europe. Many uh countries  and the Philippines and Thailand and uh Canada. And uh the, the opportunities  help me see and understand other cultures. Um through that um  opportunity um I can be more easily adapted to uh this country United  States and is uh it was a good privilege for me.
