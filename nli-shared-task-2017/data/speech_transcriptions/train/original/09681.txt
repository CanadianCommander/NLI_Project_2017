I think a quality that makes someone a variable member of the team it's the love for the well done work because sometimes who's in a team working with the only ones to do the stuff and then get back to their lives or go taking a nap or something like that. So I think it's very important to work with people really likes to do things who are properly and who wants to satisfied by doing a work that's uh below their possibilities. So if they really don't give everything or do their best they won't be satisfied. I think it's very important.
