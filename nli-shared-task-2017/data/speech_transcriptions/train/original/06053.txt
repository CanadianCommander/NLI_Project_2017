What I miss most about my home when I'm away is uh the sound of birds chirping outside my window when I wake up in the morning. And the voice of uh my parents as they uh, talk after they wake up. Uh the breakfast I found, I find ready on the table as soon as I get out of bed. And uh how my sister and I have long time uh long night uh talks at night uh about everything and nothing. That's all.
