Uh I do software implementations for, for large uh fortune <%12.7> companies. I would sink in this profession because it enables me opportunities to work for different clients. Uh clients who are completely different from one another uh as varied as working from aviation to agricultural uh engineering and, and whatever have you. This, this gives me a lot uh chances to understand different uh industries and, and see how they function. And it enables me to effective bottom lines directly by implementing softwares, which, which enable them basically to, to get real time.
