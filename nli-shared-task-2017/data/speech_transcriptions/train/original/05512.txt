Of course the thing I miss most about my home when I'm I'm away uh is my family, people who usually live in my home and that's because uh they help me, they, they advise me cause it's better to to be with your people uh they can give your ideas and conversation and and they can help you so that's the thing I miss most from my, from my home. I don't miss material things, but the people who lives with me and uh gives me their hospitality and and they don't <%35.0> to help in in that time I, I am with them. So that's the thing I miss more when I am far away from home, my people.
