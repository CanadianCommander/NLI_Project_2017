Well I would definitely recommend when you come to Mexico to visit some of it's beautiful beaches specifically go to some place uh down the Riviera Maya. The Riviera Maya is uh, uh one of the most magnificent uh places in Mexico and the Caribbean uh where you can find several different species of, of wild life. And most, most important of all some of the most beautiful beaches white sand beaches. There is a nice, it's a nice place also to get to know the people. The people from that part of the country are the nicest people there are. I would definitely recommend you coming to Riviera Maya.
