Uh uh I only enjoy to read about this because I am aware about what's happening in the world. I I'd read about different kind of <%> theories that explains what is happening. For example the war in Iraq uh or diplomacy in Venezuela <%> and and what are going to be the impacts of those kinds of events or situations that are in the rest of the world and particularly to my world that is Peru, United States and Europe <%> of world uh.
