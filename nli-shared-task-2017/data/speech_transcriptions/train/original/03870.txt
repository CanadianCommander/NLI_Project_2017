I would think I think I'll miss my parents the most because I kind of love them like as as many others do as all people do actually. And uh and my sister my sister who lives with me I'll miss her the most because I love quarreling with her and I mean it's all fun to be with my parents and my sister family. We are a close family, close knit family so I'd probably miss my family the most and apart from that. I'd probably miss the food that my mum cooks, I just completely love it I might not kind of get the same food anywhere else in the world. The food probably comes with all the love.
