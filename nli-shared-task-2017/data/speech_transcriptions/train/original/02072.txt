Uh I think the most important thing is that you may miss is I believe it's the comfort. Because like if you go to hotel or a holiday or even some other places in European and America the only thing is like I can be conformable when I live in my place. So I think the comfort is very important and also the local foods and like the things that you get used to it like drinks like even like movies you go or like theaters or like the bands you listen. Um and also like the things you miss like, I don't know maybe like uh when you go somewhere like you have to do your other stuff like by yourself but uh when your home like your things are all there <%>.
