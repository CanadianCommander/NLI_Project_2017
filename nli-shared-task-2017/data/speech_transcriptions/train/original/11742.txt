I like to read novels because it explains the story, it explains the idea formatted by the author. I love to read novels, especially by Shakespeare. It depicts the emotions hidden behind his writing. It's a very beautiful, he expe- he suggests or he places his ideas in a very beautiful and <%> manner in the novels. And hence, I love to read novels especially which has a story behind it which can weigh some information and also which gives me information about the past because very important to know about the past and hence, I love to read novels which has a long story related to it.
