An interesting book that I have recently read is called Cracking the <%>. The book was uh quite interesting because it did not not only prepare for the test itself but it also provided information on how to deal with lectures or text in an academical uh environment. For example um there is also an audio CD um on which tell us about the lectures that provide you with good examples.
