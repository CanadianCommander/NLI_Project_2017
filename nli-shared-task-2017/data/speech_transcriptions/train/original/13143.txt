Uh in my opinion, I think uh a good qualities that make someone a valuable member in a team are uh three. The members should be a strong and uh smart and experienced. Uh those three things uh the first one is strong so he can be like uh the other members can listen to his orders. And he have to be also smart and secondly to uh have uh that's the right response in each situation and experience because he have a background. Those are the three.
