If my friend come to my country I suggest that he should go to, he should visit Shanghai. Because Shanghai is a modern city and of course it is a really big city. Shanghai has uh, has many kind of big building that make the, make the city looks modern. And we ha- and they have many uh fashionable stores that you can shop there. Shanghai is a really big city and you have to <%32.4> spend almost three days to travel all the ci- all the places that you, you want to visit. And that's why I suggest that he should go to Shanghai.
