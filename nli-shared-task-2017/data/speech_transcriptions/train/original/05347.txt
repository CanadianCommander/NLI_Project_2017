The most important thing that I miss about my home when I away from is the home itself. I, I really love my parents a lot and I've been born and brought up with them. Uh I really miss my mother when I'm away from her. And the most important aspect of uh what I, the most important thing that I really miss when I'm away from home is my food. I'm very specific about food. And I love eating the home, home made food with my mum cooks very tastily uh for me. Another important thing that I really miss when I'm away from home is friends. Uh my friends usually comes up in the evening and we chat up in the evening and, and spend very good amount of time together. When they don't come, I really miss them. When I'm away from home, these are the two important things that I really miss. Thanks.
