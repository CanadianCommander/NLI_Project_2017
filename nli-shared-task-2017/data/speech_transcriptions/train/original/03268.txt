The uh when I am away at home I miss actually lots of stuff. Some of these stuff uh the main things that I miss are my family, my father and mother, and sister and brother. I'm loose uh I miss my pets, I miss my bicycle, I miss my laptop most, because most of the time I sit on my laptop just go online I start chatting with some friends, and do some researches about specific topics I need to look at. And uh I also miss my game station because uh because like twenty percent of my time at home I just sit on the TV playing some game cube and play stations. That's all.
