The thing I miss most is my own bed because I love to stay I love staying in bed long and uh ha- even have breakfast in bed and I don't feel comfortable in other rooms than my own. And the second thing I'm missing very much are my own books. I have large collection of books um and I love to go to the library as well and um the combination of the books is the best think about home for me.
