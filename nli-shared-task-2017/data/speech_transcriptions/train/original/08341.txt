I would suggest to visit Berlin because I once been there and we saw on a lot of things in Berlin. Um like the Bundestag where our politicians um work and um decide all the things in our country. And they've got other things like um the Brandenburger Tor. Which um has um historical background, and you can no- um you can um go shopping in Berlin very, very well. Because um they have a lot of um shops where you, we can buy um gifts for your friends at home or for your family, and this is what it.
