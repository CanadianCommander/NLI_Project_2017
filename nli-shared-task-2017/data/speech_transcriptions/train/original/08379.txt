If a friend of mine would come to uh to my country which is France to visit uh part of the country, I would suggest him to go to visit Paris because after all Paris might be the most beautiful city in the world. So he could travel to see the Eiffel Tower, The Tour <%> and to have uh extent knowledge of what the the art in Paris, the architectural art and although the uh the way people live if it is the city uh which of course the capital of France. I also mean uh if I told him to to go to visit museums of Paris like especially The Louvre uh.
