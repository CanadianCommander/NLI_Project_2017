I had to work very hard at university in my first year because uh I'm studying bio-chemistry at the moment and the work was very hard because we had uh practical courses in the fields of uh organic and inorganic chemistry. And we uh guess we had to make a uh little uh, a lot of uh experiences uh and uh just be there. So the work was very hard because its uh we have to work uh we had to work eight hours a day everyday on Saturday too so.
