An accomplishment that required me to work very hard, was um the acception for a program as an exchange student to live with a family in the United States for a year. Um the reason why I really wanted to do is that at the age of sixteen, um I felt that it was very important to go out and uh meet different people, experience different cultures and to especially when it comes to the es- to experience um the school system in the United States. Um the reasons or what I had to do for it was, have very good grades in English, so I had to work hard for that and study. And also I had to meet all the criterias um and I had to pass an interview um where I had to present myself as a represent, a representative of German culture.
