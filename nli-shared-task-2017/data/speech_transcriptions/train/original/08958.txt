I live in a hostel so I miss home most of the time. One of the most important thing that I miss when I'm away from home is sleep. I almost never get to do it when I'm not at home. The other thing is good food food that taste good and is nutritious, it's palatable, it's it did not look bad and uh and it's been made in a clean way. In in a hostel we get really a atrocious and terrible food we can't stand at all. Um again I miss dog, his name is Sheryl, he's an <%> and it's it's really sad when you are upset and there is no one <%> to get cheered up by. Of course I mean my parents as in everyone does.
