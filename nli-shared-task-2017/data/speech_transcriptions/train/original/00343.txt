Actually, I'm living in <%2.3> so when I me, when I live home I mo- mostly miss the chaotic side of my, my beloved city. The, the traffic other things that might care for me and actually other things I like, I mostly miss the people because Turkey people are mostly hospitable, hospitable people. So I love to have some kind of archaeological side and stuff in Istanbul. That's that's all I think.
