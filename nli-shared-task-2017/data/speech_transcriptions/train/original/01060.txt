First thing would I ever miss about my home when I'm away for a <%> and lastly is my family. First of all cause since they're also working, we can see other so often and only time we can see other is holidays and on the and this sometimes impossible because they're also working on holidays or I have things to do. The second thing is my mom's cook because, since I can't cook very well, I have to eat either on the outside of the restaurant or either a friends house or some place else, but again, it;s like my my mom's cook and also my room, is the third thing that I will miss.
