Uh well when I am away home, I'm quite sure that the most best, the most important things that uh I, I miss are my family. At first especially my parents uh because I have a strange, a very strong relationship with them. And uh I, I um I feel very alone without them. But other things important are also some friends of me, of mine. And especially one that uh was, that uh attend with me also the high school and the, the, the elementary school. And we had a so, so strong relationship that we don't, we cannot stay without the other.
