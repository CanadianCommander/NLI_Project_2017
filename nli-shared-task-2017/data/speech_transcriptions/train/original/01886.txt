I think the most valuable member of a team has leadership. Uh the first reason, it can allow me to gather together uh when I assume some other project in high school art class, there are someone who has the leadership. I can adapt my improved skills in the project and they, he lead us uh one group, as a one group. Finally, I got, our team got A plus from the teacher. That's why I think that leadership is most valuable quality.
