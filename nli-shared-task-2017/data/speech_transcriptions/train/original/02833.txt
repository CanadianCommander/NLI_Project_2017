What I miss most when I'm away from home is that I'm responsible for making me my meals or um yeah at home start storying my mother or my father so I can relax and be happy of my leisure. Furthermore I don't have always to clear up everything but when I'm away for example in my university city I have to clean up the rooms myself. And also when I'm away I don't have so many people to speak to like I'm when at home. There I can speak to my mother, my father, my friends and so on.
