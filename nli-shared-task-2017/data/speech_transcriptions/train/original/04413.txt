Well belongingness to a group very good and the person should be able to connect with other people and he should be patient to listen to the views and present his views which are clear. And then he should not be aggressive while he presents these views, he may not be a group leader. To be a group leader he has to take the views of all the people but as a simple member of the group he has to be patient non-aggressive and there should be a feeling of belongingness to that particular group. There should be some kind of emotions which connect that person to that group and it should not be like uh he is separated from the other people and he have an instinctive just like he has to sync in the differences which he has with the other group and then he should be able to cooperate with other and there is no competition within the group members. It's all the cooperation and it's the best of the group and the best of the person which is being taken when a person is in a group and not just the best of the person. So that's it.
