That's a project on the stock market that's the Indian stock market that is BSC and BNSC. It was an important uh project the accomplishment because it is basically you know related to uh the masters degree that I was going to pursue. And the project that I was going to do was basically going to help me a lot on the masters maybe, like the in the financial and engineering and operational research that will help me in that particular area. So the topic had to be a real topic to which even had to be critical and the work I had done would definitely help me in the admission that I got as well as you know in the overall course.
