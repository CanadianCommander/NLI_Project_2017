I think that the thing um I miss most uh when I'm away is uh space and the great room that uh my house offers uh because I live in a country um when I'm in Paris for example um I miss this great space. Um moreover I miss my parents uh and my sister uh which help us and um I can always rely on. Uh and I have I have strong uh links uh with them. I can always talk uh about many subjects and I think that that I made that.
