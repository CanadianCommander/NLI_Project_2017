I read a very interesting book which is Men Are from Mars and Women Are from Venus. This book tackles the basic difference between men and women. It also talks about the differences and the reasons for the, for these differences. It basically gave specific examples about uh misunderstanding and misconception that happen frequently and that lead to uh common uh conflicts or common clashes. This book uh gives a new insight about this relationship. And it provides a nice grounds which you see the basic differences between men and women. That's all.
