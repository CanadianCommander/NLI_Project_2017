I had oppo- opportunity to play my first solo in the big hall in one of my summer camp I went which was um Northwestern which was at the Northwestern University. And I played in front of a lot of people and it was the special opportunity for me because they gave me a lot of experience and playing in front of people and gave me strength to strengthen my confidence.
