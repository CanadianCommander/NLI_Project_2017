I think someone have this our team make someone a valuable member is uh I think uh most of the thing is honesty because uh absolutely, we have to trust uh each other in the member, and also it's uh important quality for a team because uh if the team members is can't uh they can't uh they can um they can believe each other, we can uh make up a make enough good team. So I think most uh valuable input into quality honesty. Uh second reason also, if someone has some problem or if they can maybe accident uh they can if someone had to honesty, they can lie so we can trust each other. That's why I think honesty is more important.
