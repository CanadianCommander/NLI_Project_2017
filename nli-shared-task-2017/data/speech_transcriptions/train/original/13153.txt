The accomplishment I choose uh to talk about is uh my competitive exams uh to the entrance of uh uh engineering schools in France. Basically you have probably around six thousand people going through those exams. Uh they last over a period of three uh months and uh the objective is to get the best score possible compared to the other students to be able to choose uh the best school available. Uh uh in order to do that I had to work for two years uh in uh what we call <%36.6> uh with intensive courses on uh Math and Physics, working probably like sixteen hours a day.
