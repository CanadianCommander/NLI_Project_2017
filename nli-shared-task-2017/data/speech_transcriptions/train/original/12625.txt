For me passing the TOEFL is a great accomplishment for my next life because I would like to go abroad next year for my last year of engineering school. But for me it's uh the test I never work so hard for for this kind of test because uh for there was a field surveys. It's easier for me but English it's uh it's difficult the the the part the a whole part of English speaking part of English is the most difficult part because you you must be understood by people and it's not very easy. But I think it's good good preparation.
