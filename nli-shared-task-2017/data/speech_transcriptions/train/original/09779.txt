A good opportunity that came to me was coming to America because I wanted to attend the university here and now I'm on a high school in <%11.1> get a basket scholar scholarship which I have not been really able to do from Germany because uh first of all it's harder to get into American universities from Germany because um playing in America is as I said it's easy to get into a university. And also the coach in Germany has lost trust for me to play in the team so I came here to try something new.
