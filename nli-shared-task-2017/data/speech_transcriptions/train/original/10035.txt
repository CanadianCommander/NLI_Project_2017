I have to prepare very hard for engineering examination. First of all, it's a status symbol in my state. People see those who compete for engineering competitions in his esteem. Secondly, it is I have to choose it as my career. So I have to do lot of hard works to prepare for engineering. Finally, engineering exam involves mathematics. Mathematics takes lot of brain to solve the questions and for that I needed lot of hard works. For all these reasons, I think this preparation was much essential and much hard to go for.
