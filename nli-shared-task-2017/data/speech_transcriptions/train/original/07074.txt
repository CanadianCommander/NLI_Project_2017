The fact that I like, uh that I miss when I'm uh away from home, is um the fact that I don't have my own spaces. Because usually when you're not at home you, um you, but at some friend's houses and uh you don't have your own room. And or usually you have to go out with your friends or do something with other people and not just you know stay alone or do the things that you usually do. Um I also miss a lot uh my house because I live in the country and I have lots of cats. And I love to spend time with them and be outside. And um that's all.
