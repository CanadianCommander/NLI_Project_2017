Opportunity I was given was um to enroll uh, uh at university and to go living in a big city. And this allowed me to experience how it is living in a big city. I had to learn how to um arrange my life and um uh take care of myself. And um I could studies many interesting things and uh I could prepare for my career. And um at the same time I had a chance to meet several peoples uh who still are my friends and uh I'm still in contacts with.
