I mainly enjoy reading novels which are a mix of science fiction and fantasy. And I have a very lofty kind of imagination because of which I think my mind can actually relate to these kind of things because such events are displayed in these novels such as <%> by <%> and Eragon and the Eldest, the Inheritance series by uh Christopher Paolini have such vivid kind of experiences and stories in which the various characters are eels, dragons and gnoms and dwarves. Because of it and reading about them it it kind of.
