First of all, I would recommend them to visit Mexico city because it's the capital of Mexico. It has a really beautiful cathedral and uh most of Mexican goes there. Also I would recommend to visit Guanajuato, which is a beautiful city near Querétaro. And uh Querétaro obviously because it's the city where I live. Querétaro has not a cathedral but it has beautiful churches, it has museums, interesting places.
