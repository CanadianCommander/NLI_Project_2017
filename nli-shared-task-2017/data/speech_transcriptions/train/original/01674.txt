A special opportunity was given by my parents, um when I was uh fourteen they sent me to America to study in the, in an American high school and I thought that was a really special and pleasured opportunity because that English is a really, well a common used language in the world. And uh studying in a American high school helped me improve my English speaking skills and then, and give me the opportunity to uh view different cultures and widen out, uh widen my world view uh which is really important to me.
