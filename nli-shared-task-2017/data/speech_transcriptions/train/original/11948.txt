I like to read biographies. I prefer autobiographies. Um I like them because there is a sense of um reality in biographies um it is about somebody's life, that person's achievement, how that person got to uh his aims and are narrations about different periods in  that person's life. Um all these make a biography very real to me and therefore I like it. I also like reading fiction, um some nicely told stories, short stories. These are the books I like to read.
