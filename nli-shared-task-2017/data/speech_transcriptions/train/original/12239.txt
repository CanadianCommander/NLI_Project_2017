Okay so what I really miss when I'm away uh from home is first of all my bed. I, I think my bed is where I really can sleep well and I really miss it when I'm away. Another thing is my family, I lived with, I used to live with my family and when I'm away and I miss them, I miss them a lot and it's very familiar person and I like to stay at home. Another thing I miss is the food uh.
