The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about what I miss is my guitar, since I never carry the guitar with me when I go away. Uh every time when I return I really glad to take my guitar and play it. Of course at home I have a lot og things that I can do and when I'm away the choice is not as wide. When I'm away without my parents of course one could say that, that I miss them, although I would have to be away for quite a time.
