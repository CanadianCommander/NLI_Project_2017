As a very small child, there were different kinds of uh inter populations which which was present since the beginning and there were many barrier between the two countries. In my own small way, I organized a meeting between India and Pakistan, the delegates where delegates from Pakistan came into our country after a lot of uh paperwork which had to be done by us and we uh drafted resolutions which was then forwarded to the to government. This was a huge accomplishment because through this I tried to breach the gap between the two countries which has been created over the years which were like only preconceived notion people mind about countries of each other but when we met we we knew that both were similar in nature.
