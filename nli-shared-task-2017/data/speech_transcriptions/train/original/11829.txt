I think a member of a team should be able to share things with other people. That means his experiences and his feelings share with other people. I mean he, uh, the person should be open to other people and the person should also be fair. I think these are two, uh qualities team members should have. Sharing this is important, because when there are many people in one team, it's, it, it's important to be fair. Another quality would be to be some kind of altruistic.
