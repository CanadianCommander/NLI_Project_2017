Um this summer I was offered the opportunity to volunteer at an economic conference in China, Beijing. And in this economic conference I was able to be a translator for the um the Harvard law school professor. And um besides being a translator I also um worked uh to prepare um material things. And through this um conference I learned a lot like things like um how to prepare before going to job and how people can accomplish things that they thought they couldn't.
