Um um the kind of stuff I like reading is basically western philosophy and uh theories such as utilitarianism and uh capitalism were the first few economic um political theories that uh greatly attracted me. Uh I think of such Jasmine or Henry David Thoreau's who you know uh like interests me greatly and uh especially Thoreau's work with regard to Civil Disobedience uh is pretty interesting especially because it was uh borrowed into the Indian scenario during the Freedom Struggle by uh Gandhi and uh it's very interesting to study how these theories are uh imported altogether from entirely different context and implemented and are successful.
