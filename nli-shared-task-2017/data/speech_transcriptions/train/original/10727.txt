If I wo- would have to choose uh a job I would choose uh sales rep. I would like to be a sales rep because it gives people freedom to do things to um elaborate their ow- own schedule, to prepare um their job at home, work from home. Uh in my situation I could be able to be a mom, stay home mom, work at home and at the same time uh care of my kids. Um It's also a very well paid job in the United states whe- it's the country where I live now.
