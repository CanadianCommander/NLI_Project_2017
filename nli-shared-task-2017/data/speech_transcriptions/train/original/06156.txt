Uh interesting book that I have read was the A Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It was an interesting book because it was uh telling stories about several people from a family, from several generations; the grandmother and his son, and his son and his grandson and all of these people were living in the same place but going over different situations and uh their lives were so different they were living in the same place. And this book was so interesting because uh it was written in uh such a interesting way.
