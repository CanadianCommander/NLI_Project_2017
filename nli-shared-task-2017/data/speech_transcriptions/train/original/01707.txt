Uh if a friend from another country is going to visit uh my country, well of course I would uh bring him in Quebec because it's where I live and uh I would like to show uh this person Montreal, many museums uh you can uh see in Montreal. Um also all the good restaurants. Uh you can find restaurants uh with uh a lot of food from everywhere in the world and the uh older Montreal which is really uh famous. And I will also go to Quebec city to see the old Quebec uh which is really pleasant in summer with uh all the people uh all the activities going there and the Plains uh of Abraham which is a historical site and that must have be seen.
