Now I live far from my home town. Uh I lived in home town for a uh twelve twenty two years and uh what uh I miss most uh is my friends uh which I spend uh uh a lot of years uh in my high school. Uh so they now uh separated and uh I wish I if if possible, I wish I could uh play with friends and discuss a lot uh with friends uh like uh uh the days uh I was in high school. That is what I miss most.
