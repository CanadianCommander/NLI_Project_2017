I love my family very much uh so when I'm out of town where I can't stay with family then uh I miss a lot of things like my mum, my family, my room, my sister the p-, most of all the thing which I greatly miss is my pet because I can speak to my mum on the phone and get in touch with her but uh, but uh I miss the morning  which I share with my pet. That is something which uh, that is something which I miss the most when I'm away from my home. So it's my pet which I miss the most.
