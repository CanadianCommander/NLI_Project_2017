I would like to be ambassador because ambassador it's one of the profession that you can show what you have in your own country. What you have as values, as the cultural values. And also you can have connection with other cultures with other cultures like different operations or similar <%22.7> in that country. So I would prefer to go to nation country countries, to European countries where you can see more differences than you have. Why this one, because also, I like the it make the this to speak different languages speak uh French, German. And I would like to, to learn some Japanese so it's a good way to practice.
