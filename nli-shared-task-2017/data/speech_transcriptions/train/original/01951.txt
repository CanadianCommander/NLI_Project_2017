When I will be away from home the most thing that will be missing would be my family, the fun and the enjoyment and the care that I receive from my parents and my sister and brother would be nowhere found on the earth. The fun that I share with my brother and sister, enjoying playing is something very different and the care from my mom and dad. They also give me the direction to move ahead in life. When I'm wrong they teach me how to correct. Secondly, also miss the food that I have at home. No one can ever prepare that delicious food uh one the <%> as well. Actually also the location of my fa- uh house is too great. It has a huge green background available to have energy, liveliness and company.
