The accomplishment uh that required me to work very hard was getting admission into Indian Institute of Technology, which is one of the prestigious uh engineering schools in India. I had to really work hard for it because uh there is great competition. There are around about one like fifty thousand people appearing for the exam and there are only fifteen hundred uh seats. So I had to really uh sacrifice all my fun activities like sports, movies, and uh work for it. The accomplishment was very important for me as it uh help me secure a very good job and uh as a result of that, I'm leading a very happy and prosperous life today.
