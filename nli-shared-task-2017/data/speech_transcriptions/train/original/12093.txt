I'm a student of United Royal College which um offers the IB diploma at the grade eleven and twelve level and to get um a higher recommendation for math I needed to be very good in grade ten. After my performance in at the end of grade ten uh my performance was judged and I was recommended for a higher level with a question mark which meant that the teacher wasn't sure if I could do the higher level and cope with the requirements. So, but since I wanted to do the higher level because I want to do engineering at university and it's one of the requirements, I worked very hard over summer. I pushed myself really hard to improve my math. I had spoken to my teachers before so I knew what had gone.
