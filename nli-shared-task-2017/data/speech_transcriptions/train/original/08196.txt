Uh what I miss most uh in uh, uh, um about my home when I uh when I am away is uh I suppose it's my room, because uh it's modern place, it's uh a place where, where I feel at ease. But as a matter of fact uh when I am away, it is because I am on a holiday or because I am uh in a different country learning about culture and so on. So I am not exactly homesick, so I am quite glad when I come back. But um, uh I don't exa- exactly miss something that uh I should come back to. So well I think the response is my room.
