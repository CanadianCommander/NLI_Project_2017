Uh I recently read uh a very interesting book that is uh Gone with the Wind uh and uh I think it's very interesting uh um for two main reasons. First of all it's a very romantic story uh that is really touching uh you have two main characters that are Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler that are really really fascinating. And the second reason why I I founded this book very interesting uh is that uh it gives you uh an uh very <%> description of the history of uh that time that is uh in uh in uh the in uh eighteen uh hundred um century and um it's very nice.
