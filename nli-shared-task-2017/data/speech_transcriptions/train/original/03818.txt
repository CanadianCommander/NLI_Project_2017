When I go away a long time the most things that I miss me um the most, it is uh my animals, I have a dog and a cat. And they uh they are so friendly with me and uh between us. So uh in second time the thing that miss me it's my bed uh it's mine and uh you never uh sleep in the same time in other. And in fact I live in a combined house in nature miss me uh when I go away for along time.
