The last time the uh book I read was a Shackle Deed with <%>. It's the story when when when he was a child, how his abusive mother forced him to work and treated him uh like the dog of the house. It was very interesting. It was a story about a struggle and separation and it was definitely uh uh an inspiration for me not uh not because I have the problem but because later in my life if I see something like that I can help. and it really want me, it really made me think that there is a world outside of mine.
