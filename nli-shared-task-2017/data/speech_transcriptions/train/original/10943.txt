An interesting book I've read in recent time was the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown. I think this book is very interesting because uh Dan Brown very detai- uh describes very detailed uh how the story happens and characters are very realistic and the tension is is brought on well the tensions uh rise all over the book and you have uh lots of background information uh in this book and the style and the language he uses to write is very nice. So I like this one and all the books Dan Brown very much because helps us in the content.
