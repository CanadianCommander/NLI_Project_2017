Well I miss my son when I'm away. Firstly because my son is very naughty, when I am not at home, he does not obey his mother or other family members at all. When I'm not at home he obeys me quite well. Secondly because my son is very easy going when I'm not at home he likes to going everywhere, you know from neighbors to neighbors. He likes to play everything on the street for example he likes playing football and playing basketball you know, he even <%> he's so easy going and naughty that I cannot help missing him when I'm away.
