If I can choose any job I wanted I want to be uh engineer because, um although I was not interested in engineering but after I studying civil engineering for a year I found it very interesting. Um and the other reason is engineering is very hard and the test are <%> and if I can solve a question right I'll get a high mark in the exam I feel very good. And um like this um if I can decide or structure myself I will feel successful, that's why I want to be an engineer.
