My special opportunity that was given to me was like coming to Ok- Oklahoma which is America because I can study in here like whatever, what subject I want. And it's actually easier than what the education that I learned in Korea. So it's kind of pretty helped me a lot to learn English and everything goes fine, easy to learn and it's easy to talk about my life and everybody is so nice. That is why this opportunity was so important to me and.
