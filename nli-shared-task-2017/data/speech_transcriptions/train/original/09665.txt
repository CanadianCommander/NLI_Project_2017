Um an interesting book I've read was a novel by Stephen King called It. Um uh it was really interesting to me uh firstly because um it's, the story developed where we slowly but intensively and after I've read half the book, I just couldn't stop reading it and so it makes really an impress to me. And um generally it's just was the whole story, I like all these how and fascinating stories and just was really and good book uh the best book actually I uh ever written. So this was the best.
