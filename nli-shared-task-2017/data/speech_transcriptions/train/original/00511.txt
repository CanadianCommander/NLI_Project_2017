Uh second I miss my well my my pets and all my dogs because I like to to play with it etcetera. Uh finally, what I miss the most is also the all the activity that I can do when I'm home. Uh which includes uh calling some friends, uh well well includes too uh playing the computer, etcetera. And finally my home is also a part of my town and I really appreciate staying at home because I like my town.
