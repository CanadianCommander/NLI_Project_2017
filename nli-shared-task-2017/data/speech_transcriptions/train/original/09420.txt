The thing which I most miss when I'm away from the home is the firstly my mother's food. And my mother uh cooks very good food and when I'm away I really miss the uh food made from her, and as um as I live in a hostel so I don't that much quality food when I, when I'm away my mo- and I prefer my mother's food. The second thing which I miss the most when I'm away is the affection of my parents. As I love my parents a lot and they love me also, so when I'm away as nobody is there to take care of me so I really miss my parents affection and love, and that is all.
