The most one I would miss away from the home is the first the love and affection from the family members that is especially my father, my mother and my sister because they tend to me grow in a proper and a guided and the next time I think that <%> is her food which I love to eat much. And the next the other aspect I would to miss that I would miss is the guidance my mother who is my role model in in who is responsible for uh ruling or making me as a successful person until now. So this are the few factors which I would miss and apart from this I would like to miss the <%> atmosphere at the home which is not as fun anyway. So I miss their love and affection or and atmosphere.
