I, I would think the spirit to cooperate is a a very, very valuable quality of the member of a team. Because team work is different from individual work. It requires a combination of efforts from different people while these people may have different work styles and characteristics. So uh in order to perform successfully in our team a member must possess their spirit of cooperation. That is willing to uh accept others opinions to adjust uh his or her own behaviors and his as a way of doing things. That will make us perform more successfully.
