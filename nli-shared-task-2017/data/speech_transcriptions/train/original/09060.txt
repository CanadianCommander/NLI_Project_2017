When I'm away from my home I miss a number of things but most important of them is the sense of belongingness. It's the best place in the whole world where I think I belong very well. I adjust to that place very well. Uh second thing I miss is my parents. Uh they are my guide and even I admire them and therefore I miss them a lot. Another thing which I miss about my home is the food and that my mom prepares. It is very delicious and also not available anywhere else. So I think these are a few things which I miss about my home a lot.
