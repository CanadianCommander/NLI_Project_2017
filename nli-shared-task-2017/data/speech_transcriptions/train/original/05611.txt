I joined a track team last year, and it was during winter and I never run in my life and I was never a runner. But um when I, the first practice, it was really hard and I couldn't really run. And I gave up a couple times, but my coach helped me to run with me. I mean he helped, he run with me and I was really unconfident about myself. But um at the end of the season uh he gave me confidence because I improved in running, and I achieved the track team.
