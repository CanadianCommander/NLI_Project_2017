When I was in <%2.8> I wanted to score very good <%4.9>. I worked very hard for doing that. It was very important for me because I didn't school well in my intermediate and tenth class. It was um the tough time for me because if it was not all that,  if uh I would not have been schooled then I would not get good job or I could not write yearly out of the exams. So I worked hard for my exams and I worked, I was successful in doing that. Um and then I did.
