If I could have any job or career I wanted I would choose to be a professional volleyball player. This is because I have been playing volleyball for five years. In this five years, I met a lot of friends and I like playing volleyball because it is exciting, I like hitting the ball and also I enjoy doing teamwork with other people. The cooperating process between us is very fun and I'd love to do that. Also playing volleyball give me many interesting memories and they are very good memories and I love to have them in my life time.
