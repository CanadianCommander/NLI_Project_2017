When I'm away what I miss the most about my home country is the food. I come from France and there the food is really important. My favorite food is cheese and often abroad cheese doesn't taste as good as in France. Uh for example in Germany um the cheese doesn't have a strong taste, German people like rather um um other they they like Gouda for example which is a kind of cheese that I don't like because I don't feel that it has a taste. So when I guess when I'm abroad I'm dreaming about cheese because it's the thing I miss the most.
