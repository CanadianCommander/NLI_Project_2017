The cooperativeness of a person is very important for any team, for any team member. And I feel this property is very important because of a couple of reason. Because if a person is uh, is cooperative, then only will be helpful and team will strive further to achieve his goal. And if a person is not a cooperative then it will be difficult to adjust himself. And for other, other member also for in the team. The second reason why I believed the cooperativeness is important is that uh, if the person is cooperative then uh it will be a harmony in the team and the team will perform better. And you can put this suggestion and uh you can get, the people can get the idea from him also and this should be.
