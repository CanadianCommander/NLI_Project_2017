An accomplishment that was very hard for me this summer when I went to the <%> to do <%> in a summer school and <%>. It was very hard because I was uh in my own. I had to study very alert. And also my family was not there so I don't have at least someone who I can see everyday to support me and to encourage me in my investment. That's why it was this way it is it was very difficult for me but I know that I'll lear- I learned there a lot and it was what encouraged me to go through the difficult and through the difficulties and go to the end of and I obtained my grades there.
