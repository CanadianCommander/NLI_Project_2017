The most thing I miss when I'm away from home is spending time with my family and my friends from home because um I was used to so in formal times and I really like to um do things together with my family and my friends. Um and also miss um the house and the garden and the nature uh we have at home because um now I live in a big city and it's really hard to find um recreation areas and nature in the city. So I often travel home because I like doing all the recreation stuff.
