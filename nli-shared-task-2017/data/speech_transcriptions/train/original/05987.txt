If some of my friends from another country would come and see me I would show them uh the biggest city of Turkey which is Istanbul. And the reason why I want to show the city is that uh firstly the city is both traditional and both modern. So, it has a lot of more sites and things to offer for trees and practically for my friends. And a second reason why I would like to show Istanbul is that it has a really a very rich night life um and I know that my friends like go, going, like going to the bars and night clubs and Istanbul is very rich and has a lot of alternatives to offer.
