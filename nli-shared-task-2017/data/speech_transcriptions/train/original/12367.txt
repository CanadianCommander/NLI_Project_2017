I've been given the opportunity this summer to go to Ireland for two months. I think it's a special opportunity because I've been able to work there. So that means to live uh all the time with people speaking English. I've met uh friends that I wouldn't have been able to make in France with different way of thinking and different surrounding they were not coming from the same um class a me. And uh I also appreciated the fact that I could visit a new city that I, I have be- never been to which was uh Dublin. And uh I um I also very, appreciated very um.
