I think if a friend comes to visit me I will um take him to Venice first of all because Venice is the most represented, is a representative town in Italy. The second place would be Rome because it's the capital and it's the most historic place uh that Italy has it's uh well known everywhere. And the third place would Florence because it's uh the most important town for uh renascence in Florence uh you can see um the best part of uh ita- Italy, Italy, Italy sorry. And also Florence is uh, is uh very nice place very good place to uh for food and wine. In fact Florence uh has a lot of very beautiful restaurants and that uh very nice astronomy we can also.
