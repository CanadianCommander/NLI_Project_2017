Went to Hanyang University in South Korea and my major was tourism. And when I was in a sophomore, when I was a sophomore I I had a chance to go to Japan as an international exchange student and also scholarship was provided and the dorm was provided so I didn't have to worry about my finances so that I could con- focus on studying Japanese and making friends there so that I could learn a lot of things from Japanese and lang- language s- s- so it helped me a lot about studying my major tourism. I'm very appreciate it.
