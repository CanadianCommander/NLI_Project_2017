One of the most important accomplishments of mine have been me clearing Joint Entrance Examination and getting fifth rank in it. And it is very it's really very important for me because to enter in this examination is one of the most difficult examinations in India and once you get through it you get into you can get can into IITs which are really very prestigious institutes of the country and and and I actually had to work really hard for it. I prepared for it for two years and I had to study for around five or six hours each day. And now, since I've cleared it and I have accoomp- I've made this great accomplishment, and I'm also now I'm realizing that it's really very important for me because I can choose difficult subjects and I can study various interesting IIT provided to me and it was really important to me.
