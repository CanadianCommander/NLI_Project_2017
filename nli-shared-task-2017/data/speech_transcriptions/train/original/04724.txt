I suggest to visit uh Tokyo and Kyoto uh because uh the Tokyo is the capital of Japan and the Kyoto is uh ancient uh Kyoto used to be uh capital in ancient time. And there is a lot of historical buildings in Sawan so it's and there's a lot of visitors and tourists in Kyoto. So it's nice to visit, and then Tokyo is currently uh capital of Japan is it's well developed so that uh there's so much shopping center so it's nice to do shopping.
