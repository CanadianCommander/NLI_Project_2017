As far as I'm concerned I believe I will choose Harry Potter because uh firstly, uh I I I I study in the department of English and so the Harry Potter is one of the books <%> my presentation and I gain a lot from from there and it is very interesting. And second for me, I think it is very interesting and in the uh when I read that book I can think lots of things and think lots of impossible things like it to be true and the book is really amazing. It really beyond my imagination. I think I love this book. I learn a lot from it.
