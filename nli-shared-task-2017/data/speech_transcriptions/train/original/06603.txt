The book I've read is called uh To Make History. Um it's about a professor who wants to change history and he um goes back to the to um goes back in the past and he kills somebody who has done something bad and then he looks what happened in the future and he sees that it's not that what he expected. Um everybody was different, every everything was different, the whole the whole world changed and it's not this what he liked. So the book is about that you have you have to learn, that you have to learn that you have to accept the the past and  you not, you should not try to change it.
