An interesting book I have read um is the one called To Kill a Mockingbird. I thought the book, this book was very interesting because it had racial conflicts in society and it was about this lawyer who despite um uh despite society's prejudice against black people, he was able to defend a black person for a crime that he didn't really do. Um <%> didn't really make um the black person free <%>.
