What I miss most about my home is usually first of all my family. I've been around my family for a long time before I moved away when I was twenty one. So I get used to have all my my parents, my sister and my uncles around me. Secondly what I miss about home is the comfort I enjoy and the food my mom cook for me or that I didn't have to clean my room, to clean the house. But what the problem is most are all my friends. The <%> environment that I live within and the stuff we did in the evenings like going out into the park and <%> because all the circumstances have changed quite a lot while I was away.
