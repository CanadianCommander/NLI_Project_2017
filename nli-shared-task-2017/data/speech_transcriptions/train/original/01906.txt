Uh I miss my bed and bedroom mostly when I'm away from home. I also miss mother's food when I'm away because I like her food and I don't like really eat outside. And when I'm away I uh, I miss to be comfortable in home and uh that's the biggest, um biggest thing I really miss because uh nowhere is like your home,and nowhere is like home eat uh.
