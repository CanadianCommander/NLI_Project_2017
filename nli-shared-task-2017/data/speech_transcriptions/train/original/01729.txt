So usually my country is a really beautiful country and there are cities that uh a person that comes from another country has to see and visit such as Roma, Florence Venice, and for me the <%17.2> islands as well. I really, um if a person from another country came to Italy I would bring him first in Rome. Because from it is the capital of Italy and it has a lot of culture. The second city should be Florence and then Venice.  A place that I really like in Italy are the <%41.8> island, uh this little island.
