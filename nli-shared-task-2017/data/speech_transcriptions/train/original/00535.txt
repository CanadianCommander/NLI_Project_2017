Home is the best place to live. The the first and the foremost thing that I miss when I am away from home is my family. Especially my father, my mother and my sister. They are the once who whom I love the most. The second and the most important thing that I miss is food which I probably don't get uh outside. And the third and the most important thing is fun. When I stay with my family I enjoy and I feel very lively staying along, they are very motivating but staying outside uh I feel very lonely. So I feel staying at home is the best.
