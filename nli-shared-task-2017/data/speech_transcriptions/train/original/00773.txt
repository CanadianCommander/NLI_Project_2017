This <%> is asking to talk about what I miss most when in my home when about my home when I when I am away. I guess uh uh there are two main uh things that I miss most about uh my home when I am uh away. The first one is uh the food, uh the food that my mother or my father prepares to me. Uh and when I am away I have to prepare it myself or just go away uh to eat uh for example for uh to a restaurant. And the second uh thing that I most uh miss uh is uh uh my family care. Yeah, when I have any problems.
