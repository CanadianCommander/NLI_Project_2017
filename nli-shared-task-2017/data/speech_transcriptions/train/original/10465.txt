There are really many things that make me miss my home when I am away. I think the most important one is the support of my family, my mother and my father because they always talk to me, be with me, share ideas with me. This is very important I think. You cannot be as close as your family with your friends. So the second thing is the noise in the house, I mean there is always someone and there is always noise in the house that makes you uh not feel lonely.
