I had a special opportunity when I was in high school student, that is um at that time I had to go to university so I had to take a uh career SAT exam but I didn't at that time I don't have to I didn't have to take uh the exam. Uh without the exam I could go to the university. It means uh uh I I had like I had an essay uh had an essay instead of the F instead of the uh SAT in in Ko- SAT in Korea. So I think that is my uh special opportunity.
