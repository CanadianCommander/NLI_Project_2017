I have read a book on computer science once that is talking about C sharp and object oriented programming. I think and believe that uh it has a long lasting contribution on my life in in ordinary life and the way of uh thinking and in the practical side of the science. I think that the book was inst- interesting because of the, all the examples that were included inside it. Uh there were examples about programs in different uh parts of the language and the subject.
