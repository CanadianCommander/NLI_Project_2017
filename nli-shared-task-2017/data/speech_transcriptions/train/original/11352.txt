My special opportunity would be that I came to the United States four years ago. It was not my choice and it was my um father's job um that was because of my dad's uh my father's um job. Um I was very nervous about it but as the days go, pass by, I could make friends and I could improve my English skill. That would be the best opportunity for me.
