I like to uh reading a lot magazines of various subjects. Magazines have a lot of information and depending on the kind of subject we have. Suppose science, a science magazine would have a lot of information about the scientific projects and the new inventions in science. Uh it will have a lot of information about the latest inventions and that is uh what I like reading basically. So I feel that reading magazines is a better option than reading novels or poetries for that.
