I read the history of Morrison when I was in high school. The idea of how mathematics came into being impressed me a lot. For thousands of years for hundreds of years people are interested on counting and the originals of the numbers are very interesting for me. And this book is also the reason why I'm studying mathematics in my undergraduate years and why I decide to be a mathematician as a professional in my life and later I've read more on mathematics.
