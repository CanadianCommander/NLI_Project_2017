When I was fifteen years old I had the opportunity to go to France to talk um about some books I had read with other students coming from every country in Europe. I think it was a very important opportunity because um it gave me the possibility to meet people from other country and to uh talk about this book, these books and to um improve my French and um my English. And so I think it was very important for for me.
