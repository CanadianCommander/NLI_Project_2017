During my free times I prefer to read about the magazines, especially the medical ones because it's coming from my experience. Um I like the information that it gives me uh including the medical uh theories, the how to prepare things. It's easy to access, it's easy to get medical magazines because it is common and I can get it from everywhere. Also they are cheaper and they can be available in many bookstores especially if it is well known magazine. Um the magazine in general is shorter, it's unlike novels it takes lesser time for me to complete one magazine as I said especially like medical magazines.
