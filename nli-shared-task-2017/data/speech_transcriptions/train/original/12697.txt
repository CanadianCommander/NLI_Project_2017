Uh in my free time I'd like to read novels. The first thing I would like about novels is it's a very good pass time. So you can pass in a lot of time or free or free time uh reading novels and uh you can easily uh get novels uh everywhere. So and you can easily carry it whenever you want. And the more the final thing is that uh when you need a novel you can imagine uh the various characters and then in the novel and you really enjoy such kinds of imaginations. So watching other movie other things like television won't uh won't allow you to get such kind of information. So that's why I usually go reading novels on the free time.
