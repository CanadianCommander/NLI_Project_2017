I miss the quietness of my home when I am away. Uh because there are usually uh a few people in the house. Uh it is always quiet. And uh I not find this uh quietness uh in out, the outsides. Uh therefore when I uh go out, out I always miss the, the quietness the on my house. Moreover, the because uh quietness makes me uh feel relaxed. It's better for me to stay at home.
