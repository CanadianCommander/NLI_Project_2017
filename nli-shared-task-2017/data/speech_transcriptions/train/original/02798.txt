I'm from Colombia um there are two places that I would suggest to to visit, the first one is Cartagena, Cartagena is an old city like Quebec but a lot hotter. Um it is a classical, classical city with the uh with sea, with beautiful women with uh with very, very kind people in every corner, in every, in every little space in the city. You can spend time wherever you want. If you want to dance there are a lot of opportunities, uh if you would like to eat there is also.
