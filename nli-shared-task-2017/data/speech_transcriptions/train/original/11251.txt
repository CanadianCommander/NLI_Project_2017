For instance um I, I will miss a lot, I will miss my mom's dishe,s my mom cooks a lot because I think she's the best cook um ever in the world. And also um I will miss um how my, how my dad treats me um although he is always kind of strict. Um however I think um he is the bad, best dad in the world and also my sister my siblings and yes everything in my home.
