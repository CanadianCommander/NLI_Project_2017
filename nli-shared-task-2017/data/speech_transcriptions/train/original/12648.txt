If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest they visit Berlin. Now the reason I'd suggest is um are the following: first of all Berlin is the capital of Germany um and there are um and also a lot of administrative um institutions which uh do have opening days and for friends of mine this might be of interest. Then Berlin is um very important cultural  centre and especially here the development of the creative industries uh is very important. Um then.
