If I had to choose again which career to study I would choose psychology again for two reasons. Because I like to learn how to help people. I would like to develop therapeutic skills, how to manage with the problems people have, how to help them find solutions to their problems. And the other reason is because I like to getting to know people. I like to know how they think, with different theories like psy- analytic theory or system theory and I like to know how they react to different things. I like to know people that's why I would choose again psychology.
