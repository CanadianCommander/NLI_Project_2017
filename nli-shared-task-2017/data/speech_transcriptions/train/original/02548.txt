The kind of reading material that I like to read are novels. I like novels because they are descriptive. I like complex stories with a variety of description and characters. My example the last novel I read was Anna Karenina from Leo Tolstoy and it was a novel I liked very much. This is why I like novels, I like to read them in my free time and always so novels are very interesting, they are very complex story and so this is what I always read during my free time.
