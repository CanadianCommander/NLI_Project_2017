An interesting book I have read is the Three Kingdom which is a book about history of Chinese in the past. I'm interested in history very much especially the three kingdom because it involves a lot of wars. And kingdoms and there is a lot of heroes and I can learn a lot of choice from them like wisdom or privileges. Their act in the wars had great greatly impressed me and I think I can learn lot of things from them.
