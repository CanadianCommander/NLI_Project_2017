Uh the most special opportunity that was given to me is op- is opportunity to receive education in America. First of all I think it's a good opportunity for me to see the world and to see the especially since it's America. And also I can get uh the academic education in America so that is much more different than than any other country. And we all know in America has uh very high academic uh educational level and also is an opportunity to learn new culture and to accept it. And also to uh show the f- the foreigner about my own cultures. So I think is the m- is one of the most important opportunity for me.
