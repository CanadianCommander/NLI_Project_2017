When I finished high school they gave me this opportunity of a plan to win a scholarship to Mexico. I wanted to go to um Monterrey Institute of Technology. It's a very impo- very, is a, a very good university to study Engineering. This is opportunity is very special fro me because since I was a little boy I went to study there my father and my grandfather went there and they said it's great. Uh this is, this opportunity is so important to me because I can get a very good education. And for the a few uh better preparations for the future as a condition to my country uh the working conditions are not very good at the time um.
