One of my favorite book is The <%2.0>, a French writer. Uh rig- very interesting book because um first um there is a very um kind of funny story, which uh explain how uh human can be, can god and learn how to became god through um lessons and classes. Um but for the story, there is a very important and uh interesting aspect about uh sociology and how people react together and how um civilization is build from the beginning uh like uh from the first time until great civilizations.
