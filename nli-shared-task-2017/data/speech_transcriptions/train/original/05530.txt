I want to have a career of system engineer because I think myself as a great the ability of computing and I want to make new systems and make other people's job easier and faster. Of course there is many solve a problems still but I want to be a professional of computer and solve them such as insecurities or Internet addictions. I think of course other jobs is of course also attractive for me.
