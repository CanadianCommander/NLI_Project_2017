This summer I go on to as a computer teacher at a community service center in <%> Jordan. Uh the purpose of the uh uh the what motivate me to volunteer for this was a uh awareness program held at the Washington DC at the national <%> conference I attended and um many of the people I worked with in the center were past senior refugees who were not given the pr- proper uh education and uh schooling institutions uh in the communities they lived in. Uh this when I first met with students, they did not know anything about computers whatsoever. They uh for example, did not even know how to hold a mouse. However uh by the time that we were done.
