The special opportunity that was given to me is uh doing internship as an intern in the school. First, it was very important for me because I could practice my English and I could learn how to communicate with other people. Second, I could get i- important work experience and it was very helpful for my job and my study. In short for those reasons I think it was very great opportunities as an intern because of practice English and work experience.
