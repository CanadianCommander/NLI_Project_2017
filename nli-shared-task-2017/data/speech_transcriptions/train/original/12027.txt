The most special opportunity that was ever given to me, the first opportunity of my life that was in the Rotary Club where I was asked to speak about uh the dental education and about the dental hygiene and convey my views regarding them to uh all the public that was around a thousand people in between. It was a great opportunity and was a life changing opportunity. From there I became an active member of The Rotary Club and even today I am doing extremely well and I'm actually a good dentist.
