Free time I usually like to read novels, love stories. Um mostly for Nicholas Cave, Nicholas Sparks, he was the one who wrote The Wedding and The Notebook, A Lot To Remember. Many of his stories are very interesting. I like reading them in my free time. Magazines, mostly fashion magazines and sometimes I like to read um well family mag- family magazines such as Reader's Digest and stuff. I guess that's it. I like reading stories that much. I like to study though, not read <%>.
