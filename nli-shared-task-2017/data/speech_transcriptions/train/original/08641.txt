I read was of its unimaginary life. What I find what I found interesting about this book was how the uh character um takes along with him into his journey. It's sort of like a psychological journey through the characters mind. It explains every emotion and detail and it kind of um takes the viewer on to uh an exploration of the of it's uh life. He described each element in detail um and it's very interesting um to be part of the characters experience and life. Um this.
