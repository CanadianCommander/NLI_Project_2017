I think the quality uh makes someone a valuable member of a team uh supposed to be um honesty and um either respect and uh their uh work ability. So um those kind of qualities uh qualities can make the people make the make someone to be a valuable members. Uh as long as they are honesty, uh we can trust them and just give them some project or work we can do together. And about the respect if uh the person, that someone uh do not respect others is really hard to work together.
