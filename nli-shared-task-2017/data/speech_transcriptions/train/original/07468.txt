I could be if I could have any career I wanted, I would actually choose to open my own shop which uh where I would sell clothes and accessories. I would like to do that because I like to be my own boss. I don't like anyone to tell me what to do or to give me orders. I would also like to have my own schedule and um uh I wou- because that will give me the freedom of um opening the the shop when I want and closing it when I want. Um and I would be also more motivated that way because I would be earning my profit and not just being an employee waiting for my salary at the end of the month.
