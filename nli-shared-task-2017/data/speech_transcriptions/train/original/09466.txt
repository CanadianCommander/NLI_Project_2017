My greatest accomplishment was that when I was studying for my BITS, BITS Pilani examination the required cut off was about ninety eight percent and I had to stress very hard to get that percentage. And the advantage of BITS Pilani as we are well known and it provides a good future and it is a pathway to success. I believe that by studying in BITS Pilani you can even rule the world if you have enough competitiveness. And that is why I love, I had to work very hard and work co- constantly increasing my uh time towards and towards my studies and I was devo- devoting myself to you know increasing my score. I really work, worked very hard and decide what I got.
