When I was away of my home I think the person I missed the most is my family and the food I represe- represent my my town. The reason I miss my my mother the most is we have the really closes relationship and the food for example, if I was study abroad and other countries I won't have the same, I won't have the chance to eat the same food. So this will remind me the most.
