During my free time I read mostly novels, but not of my favorite uh because at the university we have to read a lot of books mainly nov- novels or short stories um and I do read uh magazines um mostly on royalty and people. Uh it's a way to to decompress and to evacuate all the stress from the university and to talk about su- and to read about subjects that are not that important and.
