Visit uh Italy I'll suggest them to visit uh Florence and Rome. Florence uh because of uh the many work loa- lots of water you can't find there and Rome uh because of the Vatican City because uh of uh the churches you can find there because of the wat- water you can find in Rome as well and because uh of uh the food because I think that the Roman food is the best you can find all over the world. Also food from Florence is good but not as the food uh you can find in Rome.
