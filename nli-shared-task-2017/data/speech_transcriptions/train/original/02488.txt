When I'm away from my home I miss a lot of things. I miss my parents, my mum and dad and the beaches which which has is our city has a beach but then a city which I live in uh doesn't have a beach. So in a free time I used to go to beach when I'm in my city but right now in the city I'm not able to go beaches. So and the other thing which I miss is food, with my my mom cooks such wonderful food that which I'm missing in the city. And um and the friends uh which I made throughout my childhood and my during my engineering graduation. I mean I miss all of them right now but but this is something which I can uh start up in the city too like make some new friends and that's all.
