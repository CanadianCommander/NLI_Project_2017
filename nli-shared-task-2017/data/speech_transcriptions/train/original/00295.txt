Away from my home I miss a lot of things like uh, uh I don't get to see my friends  uh a lot when I'm away from my home and uh I miss them a lot. And uh I miss my parents especially my mum, because uh she is so close to me that uh I can't spent even a single day without seeing her. And uh, uh I miss my sister and uh, uh well uh especially I miss uh my home cooked food because uh I can't eat u, uh some alien, alien dishes like uh which are not cooked at home and uh which are not native to our place so I miss my home food a lot.
