I firmly believe that uh tolerance is one important quality that uh a team should uh um have in all and all it's members should have because uh the success of the depend upon uh um uh how how all the members of the team are cooperating and it's not important that all of the uh all all the members should have the same opinion they should have the same ideas, so um all the team members if they are tolerant to each other idea, each other culture, each other view point in respect to some situation, they can uh uh they can very well decide a conclusion or a solution to a problem so it's a very important quality as far as I'm concerned.
