An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was my uh make way into the in in the inter <%> or the inter-university team of soccer. It required a lot of uh strenuous practice and also dedication to make it into the final playing squad. It also needed me to be motivated every time and also be in touch with the uh upgraded skills and techniques which basically are being taught uh simultaneous with the regular classes. It was more all the more difficult because I had uh my end semester exams closing up and it was important for me because I love basically love very uh very much sports. So it was very much important to me.
