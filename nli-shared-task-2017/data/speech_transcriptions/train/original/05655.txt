Also if a person with good social skills can see when another person feels insecure or in- uh, infe-, infidelity. It is better for the team to accomplish a mission. In order for this, it is absolutely necessary that this person also already knows some people and has had a certain experience in life. So, with all these together, it is more, it is better to lead the team.
