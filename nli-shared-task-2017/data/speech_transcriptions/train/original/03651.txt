Uh what I might missed uh about home when I'm away is uh my family, uh my brother and then my mom. And um especially um home cooked meals and and uh a nice comfortable bed 'cause I have a large bed in my bedroom which I miss it a lot and when I go away. And um what I miss most about student life is my washing machine at home and uh I also have four cats at home which um I kind of miss and not being able to see them uh when I'm away. Uh another thing I miss is um being able to listen to my music or read my books.
