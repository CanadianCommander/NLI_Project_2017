I like uh reading novels a lot more than the magazines or poetry because I get to explore new world uh beyond new horizons and I can, I can uh leave my imagination <%> and it can go anywhere to uh to moon to endless anywhere uh in this universe and uh it just gives you feel, the joys that I don't think the magazine or poetry could provide. And I also do like to read newspaper just to get uh keep updated about the information on know what the world is doing and uh everything. But still I will prefer novels. Uh I prefer <John Grisham uh novels. Uh he write good stuff about.
