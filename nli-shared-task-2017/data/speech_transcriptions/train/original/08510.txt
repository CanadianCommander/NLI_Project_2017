Well um the great accomplishment for me was uh to take uh big test uh for medicine so I had to work quite hard for um uh during the whole uh semester and especially sometime before uh before I took the test and so yeah it was really important to me to um not to fail in this test um yeah because I wanted, I really absolutely wanted to uh to be a doctor. So um yeah that's it.
