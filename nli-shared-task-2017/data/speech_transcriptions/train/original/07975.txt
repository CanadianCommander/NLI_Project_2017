Uh one thing I miss about when I'm away is my mother and father father, um when I was when I was uh I meant home, they take care of me when I was away from home uh I miss their cares, I miss their sayings. And after I, uh the second thing I miss about my home is the music uh I usually and always listening at home uh because one time uh I take a tourist but I haven't got the CD with me um uh I uh really miss the music I usually listen at home, um so I can only sing by myself so that I can uh remember what I have heard when I was at home.
