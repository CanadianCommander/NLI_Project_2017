If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country I would suggest them to visit the city <%>. I think <%> describes the heritage and culture of our country in one of the most beautiful ways. Palaces and sports spread all throughout the city areas that has garments and other animals which are used in the desert culture still roaming about in various section of the cities. It is there is free markets which will attract <%> a lot. this is what inherently appeals to the uh to the foreigners. The they would like to see what is actually part of the culture of that country as they are visiting. Rather than seeing a financial centre.
