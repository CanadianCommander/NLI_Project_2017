A special opportunity that was given was when I, I got scholarship for um, for my, my university class. I was so happy because I like studying, so um when I got that scholarship, I was be able to continue my school and because my family was not be able to, to, to, to, to give me all I need to, in order to, to finish my school. So it was uh important to me uh because uh I, uh I didn't, didn't have any other opportunity so I was so happy because of that opportunity I got.
