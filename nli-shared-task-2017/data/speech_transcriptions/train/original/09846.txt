I do like to read magazines during my free time. For example, it's like GQ Esquire. I like fashion, I like to follow trends and these are popular for my age people. Also I'd like to major in fashion through college uh, I always care about my styling and, and <%> I even make my own clothes and design them. Therefore in my opinion, I think reading magazines will help me most.
