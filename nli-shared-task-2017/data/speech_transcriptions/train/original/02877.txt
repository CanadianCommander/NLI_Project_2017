I had to prepare for my ICSCs, I had to work hard daily. I had to give enough time to study and less time for play and I had to study very hard. I had chosen subjects like business studies, economics, accounting and uh natural economy, Maths and English. And uh my grades were pretty good and I accomplished what I wanted, I achieved what I wanted.
