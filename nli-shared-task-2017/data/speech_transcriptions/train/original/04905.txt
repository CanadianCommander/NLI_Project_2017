Well being honest I am not that kind of reader type so um I actually prefer to read some magazines but not like magazines on some topic of concern for example economics. I prefer to read to read magazines with the topic of music. Um my favorite magazine is called Visions, this um magazine about uh what's up uh new in the in the music business and uh which bands are new and where they're from or what kind of new CD they brought out. Um uh furthermore I do not like to read novels or some poetries. Uh the main reason for this is um so June.
