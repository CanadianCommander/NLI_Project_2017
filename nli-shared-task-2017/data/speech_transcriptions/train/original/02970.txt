If I can choose any job I would community environment. I would like to work for uh for the development of people. I really care about helping people and give them the opportunity to have some po- to have some chance to improve their lives. Many of the people in the rural area of Guarimala are lack of opportunities and sometime they don't have um any help from the government, from the institutions so I will, I will help them to.
