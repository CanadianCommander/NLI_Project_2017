The, my best accomplishment was uh writing a <%3.9> the uh program for uh analyzing uh the structure of uh arrays. Uh it was important because uh, uh when you see a reason generally, normally it cause the span or few bite and uh analyzing that the square for uh accessing them and uh optimizing that performance would actually mean a lot a lot in increasing that performance of the overall program. I was able to uh increase the performance of a si- single array which was to <%40.2>, which had a thousand units so uh, some to.
