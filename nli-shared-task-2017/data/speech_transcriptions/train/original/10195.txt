My parents gave a special opportunity to me when um I was seventeen years old because they allowed me to go to the US and study there for a year. So that was very important to um first evaluate my English and then improve my English and to get to know uh other people than I would have got know in Germany. And so um this opportunity really changed my life in that I know, now know a lot of new people and um have better grades in school in English and especially in math because of a nice math teacher I met in the US.
