Yeah I miss my family, my friends, my freedom when I'm away in home and uh when I'm away in the home and I think I miss a lot <%> and and also things which are like <%> most beautiful place in the world and when I'm alone I want somebody to support me in the home but support and interaction <%> family and friends. But I don't get it when I'm alone so I think the home is the best place for me, I miss it a lot when I'm away from the home because there is a lot of difference between staying at home and away from home.
