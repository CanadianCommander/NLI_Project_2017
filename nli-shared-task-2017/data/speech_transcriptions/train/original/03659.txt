Uh my, uh my interesting book is uh Put off the Society because uh it uh mean uh, it contain, contained that it is important to concentrate a pre- a present so I, I am very impressive this book because uh I think that uh present is more than important the past or future so I very uh agree with uh the author of this book and very many things I learned about the importance of the present.
