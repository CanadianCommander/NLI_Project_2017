I think the main quality that makes someone a really good member of a team is uh his or her trust ability. I mean she or he or who we talking about has to hold to hold no secrets from a team and n- sh- doesn't have to hide any secrets or attitudes from team. Of course she or him have to be uh alive and lovely to the teammates.
