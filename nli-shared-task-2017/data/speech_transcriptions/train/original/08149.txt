One of the best accomplishment that I have myself achieve is um going to a Chinese um speaking competition. Um since I was a child I've been learning um and practicing Chinese but I have never um participated in a competition so I practice everyday um s- speaking. And I'm planning out my speeches and I work very hard um to deliver good speech. And um the um as a result I had a second prize and yo- um it was. The experience was very meaningful because not only it improve my language skills, um I um became to improve my public speaking skills and overcome my stage fright and also um increase pride.
