I love to read novels which are <%> that is because it takes you to a different here. It also uh let you know about different cultures, different people and different type of incident or circustances that exist at that time. It can give you a great insight about the history and other events of that period or of that time. Coming to magazine I love reading about current affairs, politics, social issues and reviews of music and movies. Magazines are a great way to know more about these things and it also helps you be an outgoing.
