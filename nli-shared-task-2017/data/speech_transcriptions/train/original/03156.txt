If you ask me what, uh what thing the most I miss uh my home when I am away uh I will say I miss my family members most. Because uh I spend most of time with them and we talk to each others, we watching TV together, we uh have dinner together. So the atmosphere between me and my family members are so uh warm and pleasant. So it is a feeling that I would never forget. So when I'm away from my home uh the most ones that I miss is my family members. That's all.
