In my free time what I enjoy the most reading are newspapers, international newspapers to be exact. Um one in the one hand because in my school work it's very demanding. I study international relations and I have to be aware of all the things that are happening in the world but also for my personal culture. I love knowing what's the news in the world and what is happening every time and everywhere. I also like to read novels in English like Frank McCourt to improve my vocabulary and also to think about something else rather than problems and news. Um then if I really have a free time I enjoy reading magazines such as cosmopolitan.
