When I was in America I missed Japanese food so much. It was the most thing that I missed. Of course I miss my family, friends and all my thing I have in Japan but food was totally different in the United States um because I it took it took for it took for a while for me to get used to it. And when I when I was eating American food every single day I got tired of it and um it was just really different. So I think food is really important and it keeps me up.
