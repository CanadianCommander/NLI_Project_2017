Um although other people would prefer uh reading novels and uh poetry and uh I like to read magazines especially political magazines because uh they had um background information about politics according to newspapers I read everyday. uh you got um a lot of diagrams and pictures and interviews with um important people from politics or uh out of the society. Uh there are uh large number of uh things and topics you are able to uh to read about and so um, I prefer this instead of novels.
