In my opinion the most important quality a team member should have is team spirit. If a person doesn't have a team spirit he doesn't have the ability to work with each team or a group. The person might not uh have uh have a chance to explore his uh own qualities and give it to the team. And ultimately would affect the end result. By working in a team if uh if all the members of the team uh the much the quality of team spirit and work coherently with each other they would definitely bring a better results and ha- help to the success of the goals. And um moreover if uh there 's there's better understanding if u people are ready to work in a team effort and have uh true true spirit towards that colleagues.
