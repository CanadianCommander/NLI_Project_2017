I'm from Italy so if someone wants I'm here I suggest to go to <%6.0> because uh there is a city in the <%9.0> in the <%8.8> sense it had and the most important park Vernazza because it is is a particular city Rome that was the capital of the former Roman Empire. and they because it is an important city, it is out of Italy so you can't see all the places in Italy. Then another little city that I suggest is <%29.6> with like of <%31.1> because I'm from there so I'm really proud of it because like it is really beautiful and known all over the world.
