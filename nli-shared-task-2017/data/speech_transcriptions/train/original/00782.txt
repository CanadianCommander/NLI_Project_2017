Actually the special opportunity for me uh which is given to me actually to get the visa to the United. Um why this opportunity was important? Because I had time in my country um live like uh in freedom and live like take my uh my rights um because uh over there there is discr- discrimination uh against uh Christian people and stuff. So actually it was very good opportunity to got the visa to the united States. Uh it is my dreams and hopefully everything will be okay and um I achieve my dreams.
