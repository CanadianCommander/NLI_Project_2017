I miss my two little brothers because I love them too much as much as they love me. I love playing games with them, in fact I never get excited or happy in any game without them. In addition to that I love to teach them whatever I know. When I'm away home and I I'm not able to see them I start to miss them and I start to wonder what they are doing without me. And I strongly believe that they feel about feel the same way I feel about them. They love as much as I do love them.
