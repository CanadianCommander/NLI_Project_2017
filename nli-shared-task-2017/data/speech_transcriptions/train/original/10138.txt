If I could choose to have a job or a career, I would like really to be a teacher. This is a suitable job for me because um I have the talent to be a teacher as I'm patient and well qualified. At the same time, a teacher gets really satisfied when the students progress and they show understanding to the material that the teacher is explaining. Really being a teacher could be described as a gift of the life. So it's really the kind of career for me. Being a teacher is something I always looking forward to. It really gives you a chance to help other people and this is the best thing about it.
