In the year two thousand I was given the opportunity to come to the United States of America to learn English. I was very impressed and very happy that I was accepted into a program of English as a second language at the university in Miami. This opportunity gave me the um the way to get into a school in the United States. Education business and knowledge were three of the main things that I was going to acquire if I was able to learn English. And if I was able not only to read it but to speak it and to use it in different settings in the United States and abroad.
