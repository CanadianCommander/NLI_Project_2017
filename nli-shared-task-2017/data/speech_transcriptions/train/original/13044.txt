If friend of mine uh want to come to uh to France to visit me, I'll say that Paris is absolutely it's the most beautiful city of the country. Beautiful because uh Paris uh owns uh a real historical uh atmosphere in at most streets and little bars, little restaurants, very beautiful buildings to see beautiful, parks uh if you want to relax and of course Paris are not really welcoming but this is absolutely is the most beautiful city of this.
