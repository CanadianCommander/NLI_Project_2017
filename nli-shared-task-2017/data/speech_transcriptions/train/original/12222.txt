I like the book written by Arundhati Roy, The God of Small Angels. It's a wonderful book because uh the the writer, the author has organized the subject matter in a <%18.9> manner. She handled it in an excellent manner and uh the organizational <%25.3> the introduction of the roles and uh the building of the personalities of the roles and tying up with the social background the way uh other characters interact with each other and how much of the im- impact it has got on the society are really not worthy. I liked it.
