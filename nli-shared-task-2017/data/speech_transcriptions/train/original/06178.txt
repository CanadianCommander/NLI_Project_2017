One of the special opportunity in my life given was to act as a manager of my company for about a month. It was not just acting but to be the manager of the company for a month. I think that opportunity was the most important as I was able to demonstrate all my skills and abilities in that time. And even I was able to know all the employees and different kind of attitudes, the behavior and the skills and abilities.
