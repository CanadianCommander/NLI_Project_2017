When I am out of uh my home, I miss my mum. I mostly miss my mum because I love her very much. And the food she prepares is actually excellent. The taste would be very good, uh very good. And we cannot get it outside. When we are out of the place I can't get that food that is prepared in the home. So uh I miss my mum and the food she makes. And I'll be far from my friends when I'm away from home I'll be not meeting my friends so I'll missi- I'll be missing them. And coming to my family, I'll miss my family members also. Daily we'll be communicating and we'll chit-chat with the family members. Then yeah.
