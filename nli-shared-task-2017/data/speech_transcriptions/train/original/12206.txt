It once happened that in our college we had to conduct a program for the visually impaired children and there were few volunteers who elected for that. So I was one of the lucky ones to be selected. It is one of the most special opportunity that was given in my life. Special in two aspects one because I'm doing some social service and other because it's something dear to my heart. So when we went and gave our performances to the children, the happiness that was seen on their faces was just couldn't expressed in words. And I felt so much happy and I felt so much relieved after we've given that <%42.1> to that children.
