Well I recently read a book um Forrest uh Forrest Gump by Winston Groom. Um I really love that book. You know it's um, it's kind of funny written because he makes all those grammar and, and vocabulary mistakes. And um it just tells the story about uh this guy called Forrest Gump from the movie and um the things he goes through. The things he experiences in his life. Um it's um unbelievable and he has been an astronaut and a fam- famous uh football player, ping pong player, he has been in Vietnam, saved uh many people's lives. And um but still he considers him, himself being an idiot and well astonishing what he is accomplishing.
