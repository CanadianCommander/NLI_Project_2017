I would like to a doctor to help people and save their lives. Being a doctor is hard also as medical education too. But being a doctor at least so uh if I was a doctor, I would like to just save people lives and also their beloved ones lives.And also uh being a doctor is also stressful but it has a lot of benefits for yourself and for your patience and their families. Saving lives is always important for human beings because loosing a beloved one is always and so stressful.
