Um if my friends from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest Seoul to uh have a look at it for two reasons. First reason is that Seoul is the capital city of my country South Korea. So uh it is I think it's important to visit the capital city when you visit another country. And second reason is that there are many, many cultural like historical arch- architectures in Seoul and there are many facilities that shows our Korean cultures. That's why I suggest this place.
