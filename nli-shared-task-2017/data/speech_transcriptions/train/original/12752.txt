I work very hard including my afterward place to exams to uh to get an entrance, an entrance into an engineering college. That was a very difficult time where I will struggle uh around fourteen to fifteen hours a day. Uh there are some days where I didn't sleep at night and I just struggle,  traveled I just worked hard to get a good score in my entrance exam. Although I worked uh an average school that was, at before, I prefer to say that that was very uh, that was a time where I worked hard and that was my, that was my experience in working hard.
