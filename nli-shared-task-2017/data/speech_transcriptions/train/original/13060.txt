I also like to read the magazines. One is because magazine have different topics and some, most of the time those topic are really interesting and you can learn from them and you can learn fact of what had happened. Different <%> topics and you don't need to walk to another place. But novel anything that they are not really interesting for me. The novel uh s whole diverse topic on issues and they have enough information and they <%> improve my knowledge in different area. A lot I think, I think that is why I prefer magazines.
