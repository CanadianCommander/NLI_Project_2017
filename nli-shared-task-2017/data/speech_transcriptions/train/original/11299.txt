If friends from another country were to spend time in my country, I would definitely recommend Kyoto to visit. First I think the size of the city is um suitable. I used to live in Tokyo for quite a long time and what I was quite surprised when I went to Kyoto because the size is uh kind of moderately small. And it doesn't take much time to do site seeing. And obviously people will, uh you can enjoy the city um by just doing site seeing for two or three days. Uh secondly I think the people in Kyoto were extreme nice. I was also amazed at the fact that when I traveled to Kyoto and when I was looking for the, on the uh guide book, every person ask me where I want to go. Uh where I should go. So it was very interesting opportunity site.
