A special opportunity that has been to me um has been given to me after my A levels um in Germany. So I got a place in a very good um university in France and was allowed to par- participate on an international undergraduate program. And uh this international program was um taught in three languages in German, French and also in English. And um what is was very important for me about this is um that all the people who came there were also international and so it was a great opportunity to get to know different cultures.
