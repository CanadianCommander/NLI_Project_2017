What I miss most I'm away is uh actually the comfortsOF  my flat because usually I don't live in places really comfortable. And I really miss to my friends because uh I'm used to go out with them weekends or during the weeks to uh to have dinner during the week and that is what I miss the most. And finally, I do miss uh some other things like you know my uh, my usual habits like going, going shopping or going to my work.
