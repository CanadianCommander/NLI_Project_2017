The last and the most interesting book I have ever read uh belongs to a great philosopher um called Spinoza and the name of the Ethica. Uh that first of all, I'd like to say what appeals to me about this uh book is that uh it has e- even an introduction in the beginning uh and other reasons why I like the book and I find it interesting part uh the thoughts are developing in a very quite and intelligent manner. Actually the philosopher is talking about being happy in life uh but uh it is not evident this in the book. You have to abstract the ideas by yourself on your own.
