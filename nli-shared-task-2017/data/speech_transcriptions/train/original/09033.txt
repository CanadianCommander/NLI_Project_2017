Well I don't think a lot of things as much um when I'm not at home because well according to my own experience I spent six months is Huawei so without my family it uh it was for studying. So my family doesn't miss me much and uh in fact I'm twenty five years old and I'm ready to live without my parents and uh thanks to new technology always welcome all that to keep out of contact with my family. However as for where difference it would miss me much and as way 0f life and friends was bidders I know where were people were predictably bad manners.
