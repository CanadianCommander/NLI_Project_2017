I think the best quality uh that makes man a valuable member of team is the truthfulness. If he is truthful in his uh words and well as in his uh work than at automatically the team will appropriate him. For example uh if in a <%> team if the captain cooperates with the others uh with uh truthfulness and it is excitement was then the um that members of the teams also will cooperate with him. Uh at last I used to say to the truthfulness is the main quality of the man to make a valuable member of a team.
