Uh I'm very interested especially in history novels because of my major. I study foreign affairs and I believe it's very important. I'm also very interesting of a lot of cultures and how they lived and how they live right now and also shows how they might in the future. I also enjoy reading about traveling which is also consistent with the culture interest I have in history and especially science fiction too because I think it's one of the fields which a lot of people don't really know about and that has helped in many way from many recent discoveries and science and technology that we live upon in everyday basis. Uh that's one of my main fields of study.
