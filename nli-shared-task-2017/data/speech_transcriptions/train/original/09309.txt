One of the best uh books that I've read is a book called Brethren by the author Robyn Young. It talks about a young man who lived in Scotland and went off crusading on his own. He joined the, the, what they call the Templar Knights and then he went to Jerusalem where he fought the Mus- Muslims of the East. There he encountered many adventures and fought many fights and he uh defended many important religion, religious uh places like Antioch, Jerusalem. Uh it's a fun story.
