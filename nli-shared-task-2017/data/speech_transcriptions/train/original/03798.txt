So the accomplishment that I chose that required me to work very hard is I remember last year when I want to get the scholarship the Lion Heart Scholarship and it was very hard for me because we were about fifty, fifty students to, to ask for this scholarship and the trust kind of competition and for me it was really important. Because if I had the scholarship, I would go abroad for six months to have my training and it would help me to.
