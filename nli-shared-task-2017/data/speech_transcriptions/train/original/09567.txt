I prefer to read magazines rather than reading novels or poetry because uh novels and poetry are known for being bo- uh boring and uh magazines are known for being interesting. So they talk a little about everything usually and uh uh they usually talk about interesting stuff, what celebrity that did and uh they give you facts and things that are important for your everyday life. I guess that's why I prefer to read magazines rather than reading novels or poetry.
