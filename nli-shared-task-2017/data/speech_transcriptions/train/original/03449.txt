For history, uh writing material. I would like to prefer reading the magazines. Uh several reasons to support my thinking. Firstly I think articles in magazines are quite short and concise. So it's won't take a lot of time. Second thing magazines normally, it's normally it is quite flexible. So anytime you want to read, you can catch up magazine everywhere. The third reason I support it is that um, normally magazines can bring a lot of like trendy and new ideas. So this can help me to keep updat- uh to keep updated with the <%> the new innovations. So that's why I think I prefer reading magazines in my free time most. Thank you.
