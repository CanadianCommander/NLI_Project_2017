The, uh, the quality that I think someone a valuable member of a team is honesty. I, for, in my opi-, in my expe-, experience, I can't trust a person who doesn't, who doesn't say true things about people. And, I think that trust between members of the people make the team stronger. Trusting each other makes uh pe-, makes the team invaluable.
