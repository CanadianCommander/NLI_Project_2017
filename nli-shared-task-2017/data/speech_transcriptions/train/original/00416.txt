A great opportunity I had was in the two thousand year because I was send by my mum and dad to be a change student in the United States. So I get to learn the language very good and I get to compare the culture and to get away from home it was a great experience also. It give me a lot to do and like mature way I get to be by my own and to learn how to be responsible and how to be responsible with my money and my things and like response by myself or for myself.
