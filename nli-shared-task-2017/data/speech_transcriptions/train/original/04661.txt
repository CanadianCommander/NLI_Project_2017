Uh well um I would um if my friends were um decided to they come to visit Italy I would suggest them uh visiting Naples my home town. And uh main reason is uh obviously because I think that Naples is an amazing uh city with uh a with wonderful landscape and um it's really a city uh worth uh worth visiting. Uh the first monument they should uh visit uh visit is the Royal Palace in the center of um the city and in front of uh <%>. The <%> square where the king was used to have.
