When I go in another country for a holiday or uh for a travel, every, everywhere, every time I miss my parents and my brother. But in particular my girlfriend because I, I have a strong feeling with them. For example the next June, Ju-, July I went to Dublin and I have a big homesick, a big homesick. So I think that the relation with my parents is so strong that's it's impossible or me to go in another country for a lot of time.
