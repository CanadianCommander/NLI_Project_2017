I remember my project to graduate from university. It was three years ago and um it was very hard uh to do all the stuff, you know the details, all the uh drawings you have to do in um, in maybe a day. So you know it's kind of hard to do a lot of work uh in a day. That's why uh, it was hard for me um to uh did a project like that but I had to, that's why I did it like that.
