The opportunity which was given to me was the Leonardo scholarship which I received from my university. In from October to January I was able to spend uh uh time in Holland working for a multi-cultural center with HR and also with other people from different environments. And that this opportunity was very meaningful to me because I got to know new cultures and I improved my my knowledge of the arts, and I was able to live in a different country for so much time and was a thing that I never had before that. Also was given the chance to have eight hundred Euros per month and that was quite, you know uh productive because I managed to go out and have a have a house of my own.
