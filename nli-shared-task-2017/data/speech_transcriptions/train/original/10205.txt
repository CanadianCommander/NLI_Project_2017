My home is in Hong Kong. Um I'm currently living in Singapore. So I'm always away from home most of the time. I miss my parents, my family, um the fresh and the food, my friends and the television programs there. Um yeah I live with my family until I'm seventeen, so um I um, I spend most of my life with them. And every time when I go home I will um, um go to my favorite uh fashion and shops and shopping malls to get my clothes. And eat all the food from my parents and meet my friends and watch a lot of television programs. Um that's all.
