So it is quite difficult to choose my favorite book. However if I have to choose one of the several book I read, I would like to talk about a George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty Five Four. His books this book presents a future society dominated by the territories haters hence at criticizing our society. Indeed in this book it says that <%> is not uh good for to lead the society. Is very beautiful books because he's able to prevent what will happen in the future. Indeed he talks about the society such as <%> or native society.
