A very interesting book I have read is called The Shadow of the Wind. And it deals with a boy who reads a book in south and actually it turn out in the progress of the book that the boy s, um own life, yet his real life intermingles or mixes uh with fictional story of the book. And I really enjoyed reading that book because it's very um exciting and interesting. It keeps you from the first page to uh to the last and you are very keen on finding out what actually happens and um why the two stories are related with ea- with each other. And um also it deal with about it, it deals with the topic book and I really likes, like books and uh literature in general.
