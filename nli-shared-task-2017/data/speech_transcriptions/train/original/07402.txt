If my friends from another country were visiting to spend time in my country which is Korea, I would suggest they should visit Seoul. This is because it is a great place of entertainment and cultural experiences. Uh firstly uh Seoul is a place of entertainment such as um we can go watch movies and shopping and there are various other things that you can do. And for cultural experiences there are palaces where the kings and queens used to live. Therefore I suggest that my friends should go in the Seoul in my country.
