Um my favorite book is The Count of Monte Cristo it was written by Dumas, I think the son or the father. Um it was really ambitious book. It was like um from man that was in jail without being without or sort he didn't needed to go there. Um later he fell in love with a woman and in the jail he met uh really wise man who taught him everything from culture, to mathematics ,to physics. And it was really interesting when we went he went out of this jail.
