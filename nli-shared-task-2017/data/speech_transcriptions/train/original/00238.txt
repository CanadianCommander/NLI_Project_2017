When, when I am away uh from my home I suppose I miss my dad and mum the most. Uh they are my parents after all and they help whenever I feel sad or whenever I feel angry, happy, anytime. When I'm at home there's always my dad and mum to help me. Uh the second thing I miss the most when I'm not at home uh maybe my bed. Uh I really like sleeping so whenever I'm in my bed I feel peaceful and uh I really, I just feel I love the time I spend on my bed.
