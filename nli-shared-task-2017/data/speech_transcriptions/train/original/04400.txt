First of all my room my bed, which are very important for me, it's always strange when uh you have to, when you have to slip away and out of home and out of home uh then if uh I'm away far away I mean abroad, another car uh another thing uh I would like to have every time is the car uh because I like my car and I like my my main car which is uh very important for me. Then uh another thing I I need when I'm away from home and I would like to have even if I haven't it is uh uh my friends, because I am very close to my friends and I like to stay with them.
