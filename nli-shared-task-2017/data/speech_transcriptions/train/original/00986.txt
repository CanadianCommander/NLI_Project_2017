In my free time I like to read uh first of all fashion magazines because basically that's a mind of many of the stuff that I've been doing such as studying. For instance, uh novels from Milan Kundera, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and <%>, I basically love to indulge myself in stories and I think about philosophy and many of the other stuff but the fashion magazine uh oh yeah fashion magazines on th other hand for me are like I love fashion for many different reason and fashion magazines are a way for me to follow what's going on and the trends around the world and decide on what to buy next to go out of curse and.
