One book I read that I really found interesting was Friday Night Lights. Uh as you've probably seen the movie, it's a football and in Texas. Uh it's about the rivalry of football in cities of Midland and Odessa which is in the middle of nowhere in Texas. Uh it was really interesting to me because uh I love football, I played it myself and uh it also showed me how important it is for the people that live there. How it is more important than college football and professional football and pretty much anything else there. It really gives you a great idea of what these people think of Texas, Texas football and and their life.
