A book that stay with me all this years is the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. This book is very interesting because it showed, it show readers to follow their own dreams. This is about the story of Santiago, a man who was <%16.0> all around the world and the <%18.1> uh of uh own goal. And so this uh book uh give me a good impression because it give me the will to follow my dream and to reach my deepest desire and what I would like to do. And so in this far, the books uh explains that all will  succeed.
