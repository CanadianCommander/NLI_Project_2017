Had to, the accomplishment that I had to work on exceptionally hard was to get a higher recommendation in the Model United Nations. Now this was very dear to me because I have been doing the MUNs since the last four years and I was finally able to get a higher recommendation this year in my home school's Model United Nations. Now I feel that the MUN is a good test of character and uh it tests your speaking abilities as well as your, how in tune you are with our current affairs. So that is why this is a very important achievement for me and I'm truly proud of being one of those few uh, very few people who have managed to get a high recommendation.
