My home actually lies in the <%4.0> it is in, it is a city in the uh the <%7.3> state of India, it's not that much developed city uh especially when I was there. Uh currently I'm in a different city. So the most I miss is first of all the home, my family members because I'm here as a student. Then you always miss the, your neighbors and the friends you had for the initial time in your life like I spent ten years there. And yeah it was quite a nice life in there with no problems and tensions like uh when you come in the metropolitan city the thing you fear is all the pollution and all the crowd and uh you feel that you're nowhere so you have that company there which you miss the most.
