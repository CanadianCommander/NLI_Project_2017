That required me to work uh <%> was my thesis work for getting my bachelor in physics which uh took me eighteen months to compete. It was my first task as an experimental scientist. Uh I had to work in the lab and learn how to work in the lab and I had to commit everyday and to be there all the time and uh to learn uh everything a scientist must do. This is the reason why this is the most important and uh accomplishment I have done till now and is the one that of course require the most work on my part.
