Firstly I can choose accomplishment where I too worked very hard, oh I have two and the first one is like the <%07.5> of achievement. For example I think <%10.1> of achievement is when man- manufactured for me to bring my motivation out of <%15.3>. And the second one is the group <%18.2> or team spirit, I think the group thing can bring me a lot of motivation and also this have to make me do much more and harder for my work. And <%28.3> the sense of achievement basically is the team or group spirit that's what I will, I would chose mostly accomplishment that, that require me to work very hard and that's my answer and that's really why and is important to me.
