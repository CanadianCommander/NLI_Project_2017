If a friend of mine moves to my country I would uhadvice him uh to visit Istanbul, because it has uh both historical site seeing and also natural beauties. Uh for the historical site seeings comes uh the Topkapi palace <%17.6> palace and the other Islamic uh site seeings and also the Hagar Sophia. And uh besides the historical site seeing it also has natural beauties. Istanbul is a uh like the bridge between Asia and uh Europe. Uh the Bosphorus is a very great uh natural beauty to see an spend time.
