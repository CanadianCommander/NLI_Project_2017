If a friend of mine who came to my country I wish um I will uh take him to, to visit Rome because Rome is uh the city where I was born and when I live there's uh full of monuments. And uh you can see the history of uh, of the war. Uh as you, as you know the Roman emperor uh spread over the war and uh, uh b- brought his culture uh around the war. So I think the Rome is uh is a city that you have to see and uh my friend of mine would be uh very, very glad to, to visit today.
