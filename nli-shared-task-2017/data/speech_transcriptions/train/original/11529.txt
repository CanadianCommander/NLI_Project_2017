My <%0:00.8> which you will miss most when you're away from home is that you you are not surrounded by anything that you grew up with. For example inside your room you don't have the pictures of your family and friends who don't have your <%15.8> and I think that is the most important thing because you have somewhere where you sleep when you need to be really comfortable. Uh also you the food that your mum cooks is very different from what you tend to eat when you are away from home. There is something special about your mums cooking I think I miss that a lot.
