Friends from another country were going to spend time in my country that is Italy, I suggest them to visit Siena. Because is a city of high historic uh values. And so is like something a mediaeval city very well preserved during these centuries. And I will suggest them to visit Siena especially during the summer period. Because there is a very famous uh horse race that is called Palio. Which is a very old tradition of these city and is uh famous all across the world. It's just uh the the this this race is is in the centre of the Siena.
