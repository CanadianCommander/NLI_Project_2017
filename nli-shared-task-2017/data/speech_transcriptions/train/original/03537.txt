The book I thought was very interesting was Da vi Code by Dan Brown. It was so intriguing that it kept you on the edge of the seat and you want to read more all the time. The most intriguing part and the most beautiful part of this book was the exact facts used to write this book. In actual fact I would say that this book revolve around actual facts and even the facts that he made uh or made up seemed actual. For instance he based the whole book on Monalisa and how uh on Mon- and the on the last supper and showed a different aspect of Jesus that was great.
