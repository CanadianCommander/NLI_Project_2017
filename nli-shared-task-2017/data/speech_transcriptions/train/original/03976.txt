If each member of the team uh know that he can rely on the others, he wou-, he would feel more confident and would improve hi-, his performance in consequences, in consequence. Nonetheless, I think that there are a lot of others qualities expected from a valuable member such as to be charismatic enough and to be attentive enough and to, to be aware about the others.
