I believe a team spirit is one of the most important qualities that will make somebody a valuable member of the team. Team spirit not only helps group to realize but to asses the comments of other people or the other members of the team, so as to collaborate them together, and prove it out that it was a combined effort of the whole team. Team spirit is in this a very most valuable for a equality as it helps reflects the views of not only one person but above the whole team. A team spirit a person sharing team spirit is very, very open to views and exceptions provided by the other members.
