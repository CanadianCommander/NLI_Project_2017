I think one of the most important quality that a member of a team should have is or hard working and working in the right direction. If a person is hard working but there's but always will work weakly it won't help the team. And the second thing that uh makes a person uh a valuable team member is motivation. If a person is working in the right direction and also encourages other to work it uh it his action his talks and everything it motivates the other team members to work hard. Uh it will lead to uh excellent team and they will lead to excellent results. Um.
