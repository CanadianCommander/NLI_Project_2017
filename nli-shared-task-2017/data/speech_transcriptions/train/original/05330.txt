I believe a leader is most important guiding in the team because leader you have to think everything uh immediately, like you have to make a lot of decisions so you have to have a uh independent thought that you can make a lot of decisions. And then you can you have to think about uh what every member have to do and you have to that every members be be happy to do that and you have to negotiate. You have to to do negotiating and so you have you must a very good sociable relations. So I think uh leader is the most important guys in the team.
