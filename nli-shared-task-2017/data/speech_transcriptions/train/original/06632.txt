If I could have any job right now I think probably I would choose I would probably choose to be a doctor but mainly uh children doctor doctor specifically because I like children, I like being with them and it's quite sad especially when someone is ill but it's even more sad when when you can see a a child uh suffering and with bruises <%>. So I think I would like to to work in in in this kind of job. I think the name in English is pediatric or something like that but uh yeah, that would be that would be my my choice uh mainly because of uh it will give me some time time to be with children and I know I would I would be able to help them and maybe if I have some if I could do some research I would be able to to find something to help them.
