Personally I like reading um scientific magazines the most. I find them very interesting and they help me keep up um with the ever changing technology. My favorite one would have to be National Geographic. Other than having very very interesting articles it contains images and pictures that are amazing. On my free time though I like to read novels um fiction novels. I find them entertaining and very relaxing. Um and they allow for your imagination, scientific articles don't allow for you to imagine things the way you want to.
