I prefer to read novels because, they open up the <%> opportunity to completely immerse myself into a different world and um feel with the characters displayed in the novel. Also I like to analyze the various characters and see which are the motivations and how they develop throughout the story line. It is a completely different way of reading and sort of takes me out from the normal daily life into a different world of fantasy.
