The virtue of job or career I wanted I would like to be a business woman. That's because a business woman you can learn and then you have to study economics first of course and maybe you could um I mean and then you could do business trips all around the world and you could learn more about culture uh other cultures of the world. And um being a business woman you will have to be really busy and I'm ready to.
