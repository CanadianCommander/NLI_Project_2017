Uh I have read uh an interested book uh named uh Fahrenheit Four Hundred and Fifty One. It is a book on uh a fireman, fireman who is uh who who have, has to uh to burn the books because books are forbidden in, in their society. And I think it is interesting because uh we can apply to our society and uh how we are restrained to uh, to, to read or think a way, a particular way.
