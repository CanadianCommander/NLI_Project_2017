I really learn how the TOEFL tests because I need uh a good points for uh to start my study in <%0:09.8> because uh the study is in English. I start to study textile and clothing management. And uh it takes six semesters for the bachelor and u, without the TOEFL test and uh 61 points I can start to study. And I have to wait more than one uh, I have to wait one year to start the new semester when I'm don't get the points.
