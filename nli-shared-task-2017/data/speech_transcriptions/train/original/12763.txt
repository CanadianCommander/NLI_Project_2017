The book I've read that is very interesting to me is Don Quixote de La Mancha from Miguel de Cervantes. it is a book in Spanish which is very important in the Spanish literature, and I think it was very interesting to read because it gives a contrast of the romantic view of Don Quixote and the realistic view and the realistic view of life of Sancho Panza, his friend. And as an example, Don Quixote always thought that um he could solve things in an heroic way while Sancho Panza was in the reality and always c- tell told him what was the reality so so he gave they gave they gave a good contrast of the view.
