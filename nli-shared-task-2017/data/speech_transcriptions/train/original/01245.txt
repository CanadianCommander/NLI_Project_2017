I would choose photography, because it's very, it's something that I really like. Uh I have liked photography since, since I was six, seven or eight years, I can't remember. Because my dad always was around with the camera, taking pictures of the family, taking pictures of everything, it was really exciting. Since that time when I saw my dad taking photos, uh it was really nice since that I have enjoyed photography. That's why I would like to do something about photography like um in a magazine or, or something like that.
