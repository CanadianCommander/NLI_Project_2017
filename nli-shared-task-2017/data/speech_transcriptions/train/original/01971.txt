I only think that the each quality in a team group is leadership. You need a great leader of the team to make everything happen. A leader is a person that makes you believe that everything it's happen, that you are you have the qualities to do something and to trust in yourself. Okay you need the uh leadership that makes you believe everything it's possible, that makes you trust in you and to help you to think that you maybe imagine what you can do. So when you and your team their team leader, everyone can trust in themselves and then they make a great team. Thank you.
