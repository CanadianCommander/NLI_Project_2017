I want to describe a read that, book that is The Stranger from <%5.0> French rider. It describe uh a man that kills uh another man and he does it very simply and very logically. He's very, he's a very cool man and he does it, nothing at all, it's very interesting how this, this man is described. It shows us how the world is absurd and how the environment is very contra- constrain and to, to demand the. I love this book because it is describe, uh a part of human very interesting, and very specific to, to this book.
