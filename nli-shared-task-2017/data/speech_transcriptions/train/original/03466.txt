An interesting book which I recently read was A Seven-Day Weekend by Ricardo Semler. Uh in this book he talks about the ways in which traditional companies work and how the way they treat their employees and how it is outdated. He proposes a new network structure and he proposes a completely radical structure I must say, on how the company should work. He says that employees should be treated fairly, they should be allowed to come in at whatever time they want and a complete overhaul of the human resource development. And he says that, in hi- and in his kind of uh organization structure anyone can attend a business meeting and it is completely different to wha- organization which we have currently. And is it completely decentralized and that's different about it.
