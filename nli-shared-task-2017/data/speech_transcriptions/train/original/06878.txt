Reading materials are concern, I'm not not much interested in poetry but I love reading novels and magazines. Um magazines only inform you much about the life going on in the society you stay in and it's basically to improve your information about it but as far as novels are uh novels are concerned, I'm much more interested in novels as they uh take you to and different um different kind of world altogether. They make you use your imagination to entertain yourself. I'm able to um look into myse- myself and analyze myself. Novels are much more entertaining.
