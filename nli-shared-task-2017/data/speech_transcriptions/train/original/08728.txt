Well of course I miss a lot my mommy. Uh she cooks very well, I like to eat the food she makes for me and when I go out of home any possible time out him, I have to do all my personal duties, I have to clean up myself and I have to cook for myself and that's something hard. I also miss a lot my my cat but this I think the thing I miss the most is the just my personal things. Uh I I like to read a lot and the music. I can't live without music and I have a wide collection of CD's. So uh if I can can listen to my music I feel.
