The last book that I uh read I have read is a book from uh Paulo Coelho is the name from the writer and the name is from the book is Eleven Minutes. I, it was very interesting because he talk about the life on a woman from a real woman that uh went to Spain, from South America wen to Spain because she expects she is gonna have beautiful life there but then she realize that it wasn't so the life there. She she must uh work very hard and she learn many things about the life there and it wasn't nice.
