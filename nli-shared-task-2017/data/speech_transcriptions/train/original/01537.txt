Just in reading it was basically on romantic or romantic journal or novels because uh it has been created to some extent by my teacher and moreover and <%> like every other one boy I wish to know about my counterpart or my fiancée or my spouse so that so that I have to spend my life with him. That basically makes me more emotional person and this character of mine is only reflected in novel reading. For instance I remember the Pride and Prejudice novel I read in the past and I I really carried wherever I go. And there are novels that I carry with me is basically Romeo and Juliet and love stories by several other several other writers.
