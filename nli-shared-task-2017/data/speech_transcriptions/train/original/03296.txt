I also miss my family and my uh friends uh back in my home when I was away. For example, I was in uh Colorado, Denver uh for almost a year. I was an exchange student there and I uh mostly missed my parents and my friends but other than that, I was pretty comfortable with the life I had over there. So, I don't think there are not there there are a lot of things that I miss but the mainly what I missed was family and my friends. The, I also uh missed the uh parties that we did with my friends, the environment that that I had with my friends.
