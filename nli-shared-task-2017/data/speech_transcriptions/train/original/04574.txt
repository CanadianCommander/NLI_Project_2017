The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was reading English book fluently. The reason of my accomplishment was because I really liked reading and I was able to read very difficult Korean books when I was not uh old enough to read those books. But when I faced English books I was, I was dumbfounded the, at the hard, hardness that made unable to read. And the books that were written in English looked really, really, fun. So that made me, that made me work very hard.
