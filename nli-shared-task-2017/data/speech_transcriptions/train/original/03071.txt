Uh what I miss uh most about my home when I'm away is that uh firstly I could say that's my family because uh I have never, uh I love being with my with my family and uh and also I like my bed so much and I can't sleep uh anywhere except my bed and I, believe me I can miss my bed and also the foods that I that my mother cooked is totally very important for me because uh she's a very good cook or and she cooks very different cooks and I you can't find these cooks uh that cooks uh any of their different. So uh these are the uh all the things I can say in this limited time.
