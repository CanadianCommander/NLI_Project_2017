The most interesting thing, interesting book I have read is Hunters of Fingerprinting. There are two reasons so putting my ideas, one of them is this book generally is my favorite genre, it is comic so I don't I don't know time is gone and I I enjoy the time uh to reading. And second reason is that um, uh this will give me ability to think different. This book has information about animals, uh this is the difference uh information of animals so I can improve my skill to think, think differently.
