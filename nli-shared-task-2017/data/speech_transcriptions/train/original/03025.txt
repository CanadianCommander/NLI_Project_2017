I like reading magazines to learn about people my age and what they like to do and what kind of new things there is. Also I like to read traveling material and find out about food and cultures and different things like that. I also read novels because of school for my English class. And poetry, I like poetry but sometimes it's a bit difficult to understand and analyze.
