Recently, I I was given the opportunity to go to Columbia University in New York City, New York in the United States. There's two reasons why uh this is a great opportunity. First of all, um it is a well renowned university, it's a great university and most of the big names in my field of study are, are working there so I get to meet them. Uh second of all uh it is uh one of the best university in my field of study around the world, so even if I wanted to go uh study elsewhere it wouldn't be as good as in uh Columbia University in New York.
