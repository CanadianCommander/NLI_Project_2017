The book I would like to speak about is uh Beyond Sweatshops. Beyond Sweatshops is a book written with examples of countries where labor is al- always discriminated by western um anti-globolization activists. Now in the book of Beyond Sweatshops, they describe Vietnam where a worker would get <%> dollars a day which is uh not a significant amount in the western world but to them it's like a lot of money. And so that's why I think Beyond Sweatshops is very an interesting book because um basically it shows you the perspective of the country where it is um conveying your office to. So like offering a company in Vietnam you're not gonna pay then six uh dollars now, you're gonna pay them two dollars.
