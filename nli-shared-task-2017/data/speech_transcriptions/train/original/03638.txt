The first thing most thing what I miss when I'm away from my home is the love and my mom's care and the affection, how he how she cares me. Uh this is the thing that I'll not get from anywhere if I'm not in the home. Uh the another that I will miss is the food because the food that made in the home is more hygienic, more good, more nutrients than all other foods uh which we got in restaurants or or or other thing. Uh when I was in home, when I went home I have sufficient time to rest and to see TV shows and all other things that I haven't.
