If I could have any job or career that I wanted, I would like to be a doctor. Because this implies saving lives, protecting people and I think that's one of the most important and passionate things about my personality. I think it would be uh very good uh job for me but it also has several limitations. Uh it is very difficult to study medicine, uh the studies are very long and you have to be very, very uh passionate about it to really enjoy studying so hard and so much. I think being a doctor would be very good for me but I think also it would be a very big responsibility for me and for all the people who I live.
