When I'm away I miss most uh my home is uh the city, because in the city I have a lot of possibilities to go to the cinema on the theater, or to other things. And also I miss of course my friends and my family because you know you'll always miss your friends and family when you, when you're away and you can't talk to them about what you uh doing, and what kind of things happen to you. Um another thing I miss is working, 'cause I like to work.
