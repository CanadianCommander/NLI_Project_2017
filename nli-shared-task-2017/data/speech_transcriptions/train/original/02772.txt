If I can choose any job or career I wanted I would choose to be a server in a restaurant. Because I really like to serve and help people, and I like to speak. I don't like to do office job so I would like to face different people like everyday, and then talk to them and smiles, and ask them how they feel today and what can I do for them. And I think many people will like me cause I have a big smile and I'm friendly. So I think server will be the best job like I can do, so that's what I'm doing right now.
