If my friends come from another country from our uh country I suggested uh them to visit uh Çanakkale. Because Çanakkale is a beautiful city and it's the historical place. It's also near the sea side so they can uh both swim and learn uh history of the our country. Uh, uh it's, it's also there are two uh island to visit them which are Bozcaada and Gökçeada. Uh Bozcaada is a popular with uh it's wine. I think it's uh, uh enjoyable visit both i, i, islands uh.
