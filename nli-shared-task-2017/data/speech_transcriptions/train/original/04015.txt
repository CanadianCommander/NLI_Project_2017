My favorite reading material is novels. Uh novels because um they tell us stories with uh such nice word, they have interesting topics and um generally they are long and you don't and you can read them fluently because uh haven't any difficult ideas, they are just interesting to read and uh you feel like in other world. You can relax by reading them because uh you uh you don't have to think about it um in a different, in a difficult way and.
