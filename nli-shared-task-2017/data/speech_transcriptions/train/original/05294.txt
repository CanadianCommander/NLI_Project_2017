A lot of work hard uh to uh become a physics teacher because uh when I was a senior high school student uh  my teacher uh didn't have a good <%> ability to teach. So I don't like physics at all. But when I came to university, my uh ne- uh uh uh first uh uh <%> physics uh uh professor to <%> teaches but also simulates uh to to learn physics uh uh easily. So I think I will work hard to uh to uh be a good teacher for physics then I can teach more uh students to love uh physics.
