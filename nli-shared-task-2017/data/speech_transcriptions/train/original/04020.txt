I often like to read several books and magazines at the same time <%> knowing that's my reading and I want to make my reading to be uh on a daily basis I read uh a daily newspaper. Uh focus being on the economics factors and a lot on the sport news. Uh for the book point of view I like a lot of history books and the the bibliography books. With the history books I really like them because history teaches what happened in the past and to prepare for the future. Bibliography I love it because it shows how certain people was able to defend that <%> for what they could do. From the sports side.
