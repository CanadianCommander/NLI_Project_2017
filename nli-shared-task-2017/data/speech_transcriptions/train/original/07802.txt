I would recommend my friends to go to Kyoto in Japan. Because Kyoto has lot of traditional buildings which is very beautiful and um wh- which attract people. Uh second uh there are lot o- lot of uh beautiful major uh just mountains and rivers. Um, uh people can enjoy it's nature throughout the year. For example uh tree blossom in Spring and uh red, red or yellow trees in Fall. Uh for these reasons I recommend Kyoto.
