I like to speak about the book called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Noel Adams. It's a successor for book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's one of my favorite books I have read and I've read it more often than any other book. Um it's very funny and it is very deep and it has uh many. It's takes about many concerns, many people have  and um it even, is very ironic and unfortunately the author has already died. But uh I suppose if you would already be an, if he would be, been alive now, um he would have written all books and I would have liked to read my books. But um.
