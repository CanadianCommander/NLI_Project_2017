Well then I uh I am a I uh miss my home, because it's silent and comfortable. Outside, there are lots of people this means lots of noise which makes me very uncomfortable. At home, I have my own bed and my own arm chair and my own TV. So I can spend lots of time, myself at home and I can be alone, I can have a rest and be away from the noise and uncomfortable situations of of sides. This makes my house comfortable and a home for me and I always like to be to return home after a long day.
