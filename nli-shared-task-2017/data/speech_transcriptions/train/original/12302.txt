I would definitely suggest my friends to visit uh a city from the north, city in the center, and city in the south of Italy to have uh a thorough understanding of how different Italy is in within itself. In the north I would suggest them to visit Venice and the amazing architecture and the bal- it's balance with water. In the center I would suggest to see Rome the capital of Italy one of the oldest cities in Europe. And the, the land of have a uh immense uh the architectural <%30.4> and, and, and heritage. In the south, I would suggest them to visit Palermo in Sisri. Sisri is right in the Mediterranean sea and has been home to several cul- cultures and the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Normans, etcetera.
