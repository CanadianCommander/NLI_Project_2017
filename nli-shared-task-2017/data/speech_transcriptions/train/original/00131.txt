The book which I have read in my life and which I have liked the most is the autobiography of Gandhi. Gandhi um favorably called as Gandhi uh. The book uh the that book I have liked particularly because it has narrated how much travel he has done in throughout his uh life and how much difficult to be on firm, to be uh firm about his beliefs. Even though there are lots of opponents there there to um not uh follow his opinion. But um the basic idea was um the basic idea was to um not to um to follow the people behind the place.
