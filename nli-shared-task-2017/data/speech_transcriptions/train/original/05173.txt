One quality that I think somebody should have to be in a team is team spirit. I think before thinking of themselves once you think of other people and that people which are working in the team, because in order for a team to win a competition or in order to achieve anything, first you need to work as a cohesive unit. An individual will not help any you know it will not help the team to win to achieve any targets. So the man responsibility and the man quality for an individual in a team is his team spirit. He think for the team first then for himself.
