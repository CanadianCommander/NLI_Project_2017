A special opportunity that was given to me is the moment uh when I met Andy and married him and he brought me to America and uh therefore I have a chance to experience a brand new world. It's America is a total different world from China where I'm from. I will have much to succeed here and I will have uh more opportunities to try different new things. It's just like open a door.
