Uh I prefer reading novel my free time and those of fiction and mystery. I I especially love the novels by Dan Brown, I simply love the book written by him that is Angels and Demons because of the amount of element of surprise and mystery he adds to it. Also it gives me a deep insight of various aspects related to a book.
