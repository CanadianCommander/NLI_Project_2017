Whe- uh when I am away from home um I miss most my family and my friends. Uh for example, uh I've been in Berlin for six month and it was a hard time because I was alone alone and I felt um homesickness uh very of- often. Um I uh really love uh my family and also my friend uh and I um fe- uh and I want to uh see them often.
