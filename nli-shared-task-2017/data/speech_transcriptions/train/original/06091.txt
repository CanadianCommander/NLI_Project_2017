Once I had opportunity to study during a one year in France in a town called Grenoble. And um this was um important to me because uh by this way I had the chance to get to know the legal uh system because I was studying at the law of faculty and uh by, by this way I uh could uh prepare me uh in a better way uh for, for job later. And um a second reason is uh that I experienced really a lot during this time I got to know lots of people from different countries, it was great.
