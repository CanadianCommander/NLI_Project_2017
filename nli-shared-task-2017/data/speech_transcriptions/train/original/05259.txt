An interesting book that I've read before is called the The <%3.6> Child. And the reason that I think it's very interesting is because the setting is very unique. The setting is in South Africa where people are having different lives: the whites uh Afrikaans and black people. And I thought it was a very unique and interesting settings. The second is because the result of the outcome of the other people, the characters is quite different from other stories. It is not happy story like other stories but it is rather, rather a sad and out turning uh a very different story be, uh form other story. Therefore I think um the <%35.3> Child is very fresh and uniques in the themes and plot. Therefore the <%40.2> Child is the interesting that I've ever read.
