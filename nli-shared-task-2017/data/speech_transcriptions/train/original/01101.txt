The kind of material I most like to read in my free time is novels. Uh actually I like because of its um different characters, different uh experiences. It helped us uh in different ideas. It explains and uh different story which I like to read. It gives us information about different things in life, different stories from life and we can just learn different things by just reading and we can have different people explain for just reading novel. And it's also a really interesting thing to read sometimes. So I really like reading novels.
