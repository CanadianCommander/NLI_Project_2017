I mostly miss my my room because it's uh where I feel more comfortable and uh more relaxed.  And I all my privacy uh is in it. Uh the second thing that I would really miss uh that's in case I am traveling alone is my mom because I love her the most and uh I can't take being away from her. These are the most things that I would miss if I'm going away. Actually I'm living this right now. My mother is uh is but it's a little different because my mom is abroad and I'm alone at home. I miss her too much.
