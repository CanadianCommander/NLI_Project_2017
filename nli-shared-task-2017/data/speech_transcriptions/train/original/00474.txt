Most intere- interesting book that I have ever read should be The Great Gatsby and this book is interesting, there are two reasons. First one that is uh the book really put in deep insight into the um into um American culture and American value and it's really broadened my boundaries and uh opened <%> to western culture. Second, it also is a first English version novel that I have ever read. So, I believe that it really gave me an inspiration to uh to appreciate the beauty of the Ameri- American literature. So that's why I think the book, The Great Gatsby is the most in- interesting book that I have ever read.
