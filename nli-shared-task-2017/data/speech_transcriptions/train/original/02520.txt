When I am not at home um I miss a lot of things. Uh for example my house, my personal things, my bedroom, but this is uh not so important. What I miss uh mostly are um my parents, my mom and my father and my sister just because I have a very good relationship with them. So I like to stay with them especially during uh the lunch time or the dinner's time. In this period of my life, I have to travel a lot for work and when I uh I stay abroad what I miss uh is my family.
