This year I had the opportunity to come Ameri- come to America. I wanted to study English so I'm glad I could come to America. First of all, I could listen a lot of English so, in Japan I couldn't speak  English and I couldn't listen English well but even to hear, I can hear and I can understand English well so I'm glad I could have this opportunity to come to America.
