Well if my friends uh were going to spend time in our country I would like to suggest uh go, I would like them to suggest to go to, go and visit the places which are interested uh, to which are about the historic value. Uh if for example if we, they come to Toronto I would like to ask them to visit uh that CN Tower and the Ontario museum, Toronto museum and uh other places the historical places even. So this is very valuable they get valuable, valuable information about the everything in there. And uh and the Niagara Falls as well that's a very good place too world's biggest uh.
