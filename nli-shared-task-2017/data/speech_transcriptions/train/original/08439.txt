My friends from another country will go to my s- country I always say they have to go to Tokyo. Because of several reason. The first of that Tokyo is the central of Japan. Not only the traditional place like Akasaka we, we had a lot of temples, but also it's a hub of new cultures. There have a lot of building which is very unique. And they can enjoy there. And also that there is a lot of entertainment in Tokyo. They never get bored in Tokyo even though it's expensive, but uh it's usually a good experime- experience to be in Tokyo. That's why I recommend Tokyo for my friend from other country.
