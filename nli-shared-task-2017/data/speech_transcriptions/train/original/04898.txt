Well, my country Italy is uh know all around the globe about the important uh famous art cities such as Venice or Florence and Milan. I think that Italy is well know for this city and I suggest to a possible friend that uh came uh of another country to visit Rome. Rome is the capital of Italy and I think it's the best city in Italy because there is some museum to visit, some amazing place and I think I see the very interesting experience for the a person of another country.
