Firstly I miss the hospitality of my people in uh my home. And also I miss the beauty of the city because uh Istanbul has beautiful um historical uh sites to visit. And uh also it's very cosmopolitan. It's a city you can say we cannot find in every city you can uh go in the world. And also it has uh a very intense uh night life. Uh so that's the third thing I miss about, I, I would miss about Istanbul and my home. Um, um that's about it I guess.
