In my opinion, there are several qualities that make someone a valuable member of  team. First, it is very important for a member of a team to be ambitious. Uh you have to work hard in a team, otherwise everyone else in the team will suffer. A good team always consists of hard-working members. A second important quality you should have is to be polite and kind towards other members of the team. Uh, if you're not, the atmosphere in the team could lack a and bad atmosphere in the team uh can't be a good basis for satisfactory work.
