Is the most interesting book I have read in the last time is uh the Perfume of Patrick Süskind and it is that much interesting to me because it has such a interesting story. Um the story happens in uh in the French in the seventeenth century and I think it is uh very interesting to learn something about this time. Furthermore um the  book contains very interesting characters and the author succeeded to uh describe these cha- characters uh very lively. And so I can uh imagine the story, the time, the place and for me this is why it is a perfect book, and interesting also.
