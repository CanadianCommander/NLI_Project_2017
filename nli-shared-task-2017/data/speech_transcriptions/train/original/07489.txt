As being a broadcaster on uh radio, I've been given chance to conduct the elections uh throughout the elections time local here in UAE. My role was uh is uh to uh convey the messages throughout the local post-elections and deliver them to the radio stations throughout the country. It took me about uh daily, uh six to twelve hours to convey the data from the polling stations and have them on the computer and organize them to be announced on air. This uh experience gave me a lot of uh uh interacting with people and many polling stations throughout the country.
