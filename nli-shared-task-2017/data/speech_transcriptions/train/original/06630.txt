I advise my friends to go to Berlin because Berlin is Germany's capital and therefore really interesting city. Um we have many museum in Berlin who decorate a great art and show nearly every a park we want to see. Another interesting aspect of Berlin is the variety of shops, you can uh nearly buy everything there. One really important point is the immense night-life of Berlin where you have the possibility of choosing pubs or um clubs just as you want.
