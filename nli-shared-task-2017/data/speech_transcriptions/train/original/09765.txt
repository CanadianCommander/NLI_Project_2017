I really liked uh On the Road by Jack Kerouac. It was a pretty good movie, a pretty good uh book describing the, a road trip in the U.S. during the sixties and seventies and uh in this book the, the author is trying to to explain a little bit uh his point of view on the society and how he's trying to escape the society through his uh road trip and so he's traveling uh all over the U.S. in the, in the, to California to uh to Denver, Colorado and, and they go and go back to, to New York to and uh and then tries uh and he's trying to.
