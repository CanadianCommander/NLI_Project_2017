I received the most important opportunity of my life last year, and uh the this oppor- this um my school um gave me the opportunity to go to complete my, my studies uh in, in England. I think it was a very important opportunity because uh, I in this way I could uh, uh improve my English. And uh um it was also important because uh I, I could stay with uh other people from different cultures. And but it was important particularly because, um I um could improve my English and uh language in general.
