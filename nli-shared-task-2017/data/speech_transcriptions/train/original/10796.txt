What I miss the most when I'm away from home is, is language big. Because when I'm away, I only speak foreign uh language which is not always very comfortable. And so when I sometimes meet people who are also from my home country, I'm very glad to meet them to be able to speak without thinking about grammar or other things. So that's the thing that I miss the most.
