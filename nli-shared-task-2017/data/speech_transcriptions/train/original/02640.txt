The accomplishment I, my most accomplished task which I have been confirmed was when I started my own business. From that I have taken loan from the bank and for that I worked really, very hard. I like, I prepared all the documents which were required for the approval from the bank and also and the all taxation departments and all. Being that my dream, this being my dream project and I'm the only child of my parents, I have to do something in my professional life. And that's why I started my professional career. So I worked really very hard and I accomplished my pro- project like I successfully maintaining, and successfully maintaining my rolling mill <%42.5> plant. And this is because of the hard work which I have done.
