The interesting book I have read is uh <%2.9> from the writer Philip <%5.2>. I think this book is quite interesting because it can give us a discovery uh on uh on the United States and s- the action occurs in this country and on the other hand uh I find it interesting because it uh tackle the issue of discrimination because the main uh actor in this book uh was going out with a black woman so it's uh entail many uh uh issues on, on this topic. So for these two main reasons I consider that this book was uh quite interesting to read.
