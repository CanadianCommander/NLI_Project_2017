Really to be away from my house, it is a difficult feeling. Uh I often miss many things. The most important was him is uh to be with my family members. I like my father and my mothers too much. I like my uh uh brother. I like to be with him all the time. To be away from them. It is so painful for me. In addition uh I like uh the the food of my mother so much. I;m interested in it. I like it uh and when I'm away, it is so difficult for me to eat at different restaurants. Number three, I think my father and and my mother is uh very important in making decision when I away from them. It is a difficult to make decision that's.
