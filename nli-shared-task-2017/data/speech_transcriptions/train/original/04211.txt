The qualities I think that are most valuable for a, a member of a team uh are mostly uh, the normal character sides. The first one I think is reliability, so that uh if you're working in a team, it's important that you're reliable and everyone in the team can rely on you and shift work to you. Uh the second thing I think is uh honesty. If you're working in a team, you have to work uh honest to each other. If someone uh lies to each other or keeps out uh important information, uh this won't help the team. I think these are good reasons or these are good qualities for someone uh in a team.
