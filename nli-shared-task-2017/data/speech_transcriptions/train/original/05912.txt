There are two things that I miss most about when I'm away from home. One of these things is the food of my mum because I really like it. And it's difficult to me to get used to new tastes of flavors so I really like and I really miss my mum's food when I away from home. Um other thing is my bed because is kind of big. And I like to sleep there so when I am in a hotel or in a friend's house it's very difficult to me to get a sleep. But finally um I think the most boring music like for slumber.
