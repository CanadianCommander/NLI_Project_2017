The job or career I wanted, uh that I want uh it is uh to work in the research centers for two reason. Because my major is by biochemistry and uh because I like to work with other people and discovery a lot of things. Uh I like really to, to, to make the research about many things, what I read, what I studied and what is the ability for thinking and creative on the research centers, more than make lectures or teacher. So that is wonderful for me.
