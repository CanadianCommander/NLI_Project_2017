Uh, in my opinion I think making someone a valuable member of a team is uh leadership. Leadership is kind of ability to meet someone or a group and the future of the group or team is determined to the leadership. So in my, and also which team has no leadership can lose or cannot grow well. So, in my opinion, I think leadership is the most valuable thing.
