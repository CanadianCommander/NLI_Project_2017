Well one of my favorite books I have read lately is One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Uh I like this book because uh he really portrays what Latin America is. I mean he really shows all the flavor and all the specific characteristics of Latin America. He also managed the description on language really well. I particularly liked the the description he makes and also the characters, they're so full of life and they all count this magic atmosphere in which the story takes place. Uh all the events have this um.
