When I'm away um miss all of my habits uh because um I think I miss uh my parents obviously. My mother and uh my father and uh my twin sister because I used to share my points of view with uh all my family. And uh therefore I think uh when I will be away, I will uh call for them and uh, uh speak with them uh, uh about my experiences. And uh to finish I think I will miss uh my room and uh my uh kittens. And uh that's all.
