Well, I, I know it's quite uh obvious but when I am away the uh what I miss most is my family and my friends. In particular, uh at home I usually I live, I used to live in the, with my pa-, still live with my parents so uh when I'm away uh and living alone uh almost always I feel uh I, I can perceive the, their ab- absence. Uh concerning friends uh I it might be another, another obvious answer answer but uh even if, when you are abroad you, you can have some other friends.
