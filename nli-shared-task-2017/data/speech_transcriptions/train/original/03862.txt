And then those opinion have to, have to be uh evaluated and put into context with your own opinions. And therefore you have to, to, to, to look at different people's opinions, take them all together and try to form, to form uh, uh a combination of them all in order to reach a certain outcome. So the ability, the ability to make compromise is, is, is uh crucial in a, for, for, for, for a member. This is uh team member abilities.
