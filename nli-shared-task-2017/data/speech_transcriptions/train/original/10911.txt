If um, I have friend from another country who was going to spend time in my country I would suggest him to go to Rome firstly because of it's history and cultural sights. And there are monuments who one person should be able to visit at least once in his life. And then I would suggest to go to Venice because it's a unique city I, I guess it's one of the most beautiful in the world because uh of the the river the sea and uh all, all those places. And maybe uh Naples because of the fun the fantastic pizza and the the coast is really amazing.
