I think after I graduated from the university I already decided on my mind that what uh, what what I want to be and I decided that I want to be uh an academician. Because uh when you because my interests are researching, writing and to increase make some research on the interest subject and, and forwarding them to other people that then all about, they don't know the about. And I think because of this  and I want to be an  academician, I would choose this ca-as a career and the job to take the position in the university as a lecturer, this is.
