When I was sixteen, I had uh a special opportunity to visit Poland in order to see concentration camp, from the second world war. Uh the struggle were very interesting first of all for me because I get more mature after that experience, but also for the memories because uh we have just to keep in mind uh history, that we don't have to forget. And uh I think that this opportunity was very important because uh, uh I learn a lot of things and it will be good for us, my future.
