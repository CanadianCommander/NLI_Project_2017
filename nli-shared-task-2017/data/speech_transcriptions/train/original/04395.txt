One of the most difficult things in life was to graduate from the pharmacy school. Uh it was difficult for me and kind of a challenge because it was composed of ten semesters and each of those semesters contained around four to six subjects and these subjects were difficult, the chemistry subjects and biology subjects which need a lot of concentration and hard work. Uh it's really important to me because it helped me graduate from uh a class, a classical college and now I work as a pharmacist which makes me able to get a good amount of money and service, so a good amount of money and able to have a bright future as the future <%44.1> to take.
