I think for the uh for the whole of my life the biggest opportunity that was given to me to be, was to be the, to be an exchange student in South Korea. It was a great opportunity to be independent and to know new cultures and to meet with new people. And I'm really interested in food and beverage industry and it was a great opportunity for me to taste different foods and the Korean cuisine, cuisine which is uh quite different from my culture. And I'm using this information and experiences for, for my future career and for my own being.
