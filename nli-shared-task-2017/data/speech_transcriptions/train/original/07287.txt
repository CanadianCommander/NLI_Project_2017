Um I prefer reading poetry to reading um most other uh kind of writing in my free time because I read a lot of academic articles and um novels and um longer literally texts uh for my work. So um I enjoy uh sort of the brevity of most poetry and um there are very um distinct realistic futures that come out in poetry. I like uh the rhyming and rhythm. Um and I like the way that poetry allow you to explore thoughts on your own instead of using art work <%> bit of someone else's writing as a screen board. Um I enjoy poetry most.
