The opportunity that was given me was a scholar ship got for an internship in an African country and I study Applied African study and so the opportunity was very good for me to practical experience. I, um the scholarship paid for my flight and also for my stay there so it helped me a lot to, um to, to work there. And um so I could acquire some more knowledge about what I study and I could get to know the culture and the people. So that really helped for my studies and my, my working experience.
