The thing miss most when I'm away from home is uh first my family in general. That means uh um the family atmosphere you feel uh loved at home and not where you are perhaps and another point is uh the pets we have at home is one thing I I miss. Um one thing more is you you cannot uh share your problems with everyone you have when you're away at from home. So this is one important thing I miss. Uh another thing would be that I could do sport.
