I live in Korea if I see someone one of my friend to invite our country I'd recommend him or her to go to <%10.5> where is the shopping centers. Like no one has ever been there has have been there about like the shopping centers, went all over like leader sh- shopping counters, no I mean a shopping place that I love clothes. In the over like twenty one floors up, all the shopping center and they are all separated, all right.
