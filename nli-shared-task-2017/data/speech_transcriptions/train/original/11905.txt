Real that I like to read is novels because first of all, I personally believe that reading novels increases your concentration and does help me out in  a lot of way. And second of all it creates a uh so so is um reading a suspense novel it will cause so much of excitement in any and uh to curiosity to know like what's going to happen next is a much rated thing that I would like to have. And so I prefer read novels rather than anything else and I'm a complete novel freak. The second um or summarize, I would like to say that novels pre- get you near to the author's thinking and hence thinking makes you think globally. So that's what.
