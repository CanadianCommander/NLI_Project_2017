Uh I think most, most the work take time to get prepare and one of the thing that I prepare really well I think it's my piano exam. It took a long time for me to prepare for it. Uh everyday and I have to practice at least two hours uh for the music uh songs then I'm supposed to perform and the thing I think uh I feel I accomplished because I practiced hard everyday and the results are now well as I passed exam and it's really good to have the feeling of uh doing something that you worked hard for it and you get a good results from that.
