I read a book two years ago, I don't remember the name but the book was about, it was an action book and it was about a man who was in a special task force from the military and they were in the Arctic and were looking for an an extra terrestrial object underneath the ice. And I really liked that book because it's it was action from the an adrenal from the first page on <%> and I had to read it, I think I read it in one day or two days and I never read that first but that book really caught my attention. That was really good.
