My greatest accomplishment that that required me to work very hard was scoring <%> but I had to work very hard because I had some family problems just before the exam. One of my family members passed away so it was very difficult for me to study for GRE. Along with that I was in the final year year of my engineering to do it uh to study for the college as a lot the GRE exam. And to remember so many new words was not very easy but I work very hard and scored well in GRE so that I can apply for masters in US.
