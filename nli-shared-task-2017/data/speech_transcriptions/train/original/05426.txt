An interesting book that I have read recently is One Hundred Years of Solitude written by Gabriel Garcia Márquez. It is uh an interesting book because uh it is a mix of uh fantastic literature and historical facts. Through the example of the familiar Buendia uh in which uh every characters has like uh superpowers or uh uh unusual virtues, Gabriel Garcia Márquez gives us a very original uh opinion on historical facts such as uh the revolution in South American countries. I mean it is interesting because it is totally unique.
