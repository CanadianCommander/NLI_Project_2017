I read an interesting book that was uh Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden. It was very interesting because it talks about about Japan and a lady's country. And it talks also about geisha, that is uh very uh specific uh characters in Japan. Uh it's very interesting for me because I like all the Asian cultures especially Japan. I talk Japanese, I've, uh I know a lot about this culture and uh it's very wonderful book. And I like it, I like it.
