A very interesting book I read or is actually a series of six book is The Zion Chronicles. And it's about the story of young woman. She is a Jew living in Germany and she is trying to escape the uh Hitler Germany and the Nazi. And it's very interesting to see how she and her family manages to get around the traps that the Nazi have for her. And it's very interesting for me because I grew up in Germany and it's my history. And it also gives you a lot of background information on the bad things the the Nazis did and it's nice to see how people manage to get out of this.
