I live in <%0.6> now but I my, my, my hometown is Istanbul and I'm away from my home town. Uh actually when I'm away from my home uh the things that I uh most miss is my family, because I love my parents hence when I'm not with them I feel stressed. Also I miss my home and my friends too because I don't like being alone. Uh I need some people around me that's why I don't like being away from my hometown.
