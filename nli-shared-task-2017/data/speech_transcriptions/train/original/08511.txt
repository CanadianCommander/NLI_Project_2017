I lived in Ankara in Turkey. In my country, there are a lot of shopping centers and sightseeing places. If one of uh if one of my friend from another country were going to spend time in my country, I suggest I would suggest her to going to the Armada or <%> because these places are very beautiful sites and places. According to <%> shopping centers' evaluation, there are a lot of shops and sightseeing places and if you want to waste or spare your time in these places, you can see that you have got a lot of choices about shopping or extra.
