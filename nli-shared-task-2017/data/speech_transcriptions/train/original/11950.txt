I usually I don't read books but <%2.5>, but once I read Romeo and Juliet, it was so romantic uh novel by Shakespeare. And uh it was so interested and made me even cry for, for reading this uh book. And I wanna, and I watched the movie about it and that was so related. So I love this novel and I would like to read it more and more.
