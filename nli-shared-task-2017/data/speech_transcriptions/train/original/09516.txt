If I could have uh any opportunity to choose a job I would choose the career and the job that I have just study, I would be a journalist because I think that my career will get just uh to the way I am I can feel and I can explore out all what I am. Uh I am a very honest person and being a journalist you have to have uh that tremendous time and the tremendous opportunity to choose between what you are going to sent out to your audience and what are you going to tell them and you have to tell the true and let them know what is.
