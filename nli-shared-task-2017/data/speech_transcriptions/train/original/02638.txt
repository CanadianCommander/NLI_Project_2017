I Like The Lord of the Rings uh with J.R Tolkien and uh it was uh uh a fantastic book uh which is uh actually a trilogy. Uh and uh it include the imagination of readers also since the there were uh a lot of fantastic things inside in it. Um also it was um it was very interesting uh to read uh while you're dealing with so much action inside the uh book and the detailing was also perfect inside the book. There are uh a lot of details about it.
