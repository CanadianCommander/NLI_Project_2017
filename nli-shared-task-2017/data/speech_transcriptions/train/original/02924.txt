The most interesting book I have read is an ethical book of India. That book consisted of many stories of gods. Uh the stories mainly consisted of uh the way they behaved and the moral they gave. They were great lesson to life and also they inspired me very much that I stopped some of my bad habits and done good. It was interesting also because uh the stories were like normal stories we read and I did not feel, I learn from stories. That's why I find it very interesting about that book.
