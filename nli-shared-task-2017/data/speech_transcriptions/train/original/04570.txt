An accomplishment that required me to work very hard has been my AC of uh graduate course. Um I have written like sixty pages about the Italian art history of the last ten years or fifteen years. So from the nineties to the two thousands, two thousand and six. And I spoke of them in relationship with uh Italian art of the sixties and seventies years and about how works uh was linked to.
