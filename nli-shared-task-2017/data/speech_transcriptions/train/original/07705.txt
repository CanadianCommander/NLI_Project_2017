Uh if you wanna be a good a valuable member of a team, I think you uh it's better to uh cooperate with other people and respect other people's opinion and if you have to come up with uh uh the group uh idea. And secondly, um you uh if there is a leader of the team, you may have wanted to listen to leader and then express your opinion um uh politely, I guess. And uh once uh the group is determined to uh decide on something, then uh you have to agree with the idea and basically follow them. Follow the idea.
