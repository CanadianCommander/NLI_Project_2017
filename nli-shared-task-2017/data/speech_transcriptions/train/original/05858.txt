If I could have any job or career that I wanted, I choose uh the job of uh Swiss diplomatic. Um make this choice because diplomatics have much influence and can change many things in the world for example um they can uh talk uh with each party in wars or they can change critical situations in countries uh which have problems with their people and in a in job of a diplomat I could use my languages and meet many people and that's why I think this would be the greatest job.
