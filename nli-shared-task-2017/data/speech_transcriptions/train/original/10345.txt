If I could choose any topic, any career I would want to be a dance teacher, a dance teacher to little girls because I love to dance and I love children. And this job encompass both dancing and children. And I will be able to create, create a relationship with the student, a student teacher relationship that I think that is ideal. Also the music that comes in dancing uh supports my decision as I have.
