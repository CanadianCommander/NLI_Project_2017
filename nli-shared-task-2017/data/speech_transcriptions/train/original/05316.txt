The book, the interesting book I have read is Sanguine which is one of the fo- famous novels in China. Uh I think it's it's most interesting book among the books I have read because it appears it appeared in my childhood. Um when a teacher gave kids such book to be my present of my birthday. I am completely attracted by it because there are many pictures.
