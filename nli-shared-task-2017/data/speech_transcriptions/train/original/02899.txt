I think one of my <%2.5> opportunities that was given to me is uh immigration to Canada. I'd never expect uh I would immigrate to somewhere else outside Japan but it happened because of the family reasons. Uh I think it's a very uh opportunity to learn new country and how to, how to adjust new culture as adult. And also it's a very great opportunity to learn E- English and French i- in Montreal. And also its very nice to, it's a very great opportunity to growth my view to the world.
