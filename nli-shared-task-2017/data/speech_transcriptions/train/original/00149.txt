I was given an opportunity once to work at the disabled children center in our city, and uh I was given this opportunity because I got the highest grade in the class. Usually the one with the highest grades they usually uh give him or her a chance to do a certain activities and I got a chance to uh work, to do volunteer work, and which gave me credit. And I learned a lot from that experience, it was something very good I did and I'm very proud that I have done it. And uh I always remember the time I spent there, and how I helped children who really needs help and supported them as well.
