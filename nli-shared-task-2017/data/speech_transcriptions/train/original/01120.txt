I was given the opportunity to take part into, in a committee that was responsible for organizing a conference. And this opportunity gave me the ability to develop not only my technical skills but also to network inside my company. By reviewing the papers that were submitted for this conference, I was able to learn a lot more about different technical aspects of what is going on inside of my company. And then by participating in those um committee meetings I was able to meet a lot of people.
