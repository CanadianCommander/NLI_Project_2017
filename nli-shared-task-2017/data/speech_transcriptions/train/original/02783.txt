A couple of months ago I met one of the famous uh psychiatrists in Turkey and uh we had a little talk. After uh we had contact uh a few times more uh he gave me the opportunity do my internship in a psychological <%16.5> center. Uh it was a very special opportunity to me since I found opportunity to practice my theoretical knowledge on that directly on the patient um because otherwise um if the this man uh has not provided me this opportunity uh probably I would not be applying two years to study clinical psychology now.
