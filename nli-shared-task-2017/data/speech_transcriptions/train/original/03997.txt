Uh uh I think the most important quality it's on a valuable member of a team if getting along that with other people of the team. By that way people can organize the group and influence people on what to do and uh also the people trust her or him because he's have good relationship with other people. And have an influence on people is very important because you can accept the people that you want and you can easily clarify what you expect from them and your i- you can clarify your ideas.
