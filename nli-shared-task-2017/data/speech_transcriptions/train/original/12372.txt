Well, completing my high school was uh uh took me a lot of hard work because I didn't like to go to school and I wasn't really fond of learning so actually uh for a pretty long time I didn't do much at school so uh when the end exams came I had to really, to really work hard and to pull up what I, what I didn't do uh before. And it was important for me to, to pass these exams because uh it would uh would define my future. I wanted to study so I tried to get uh good marks on my exams.
