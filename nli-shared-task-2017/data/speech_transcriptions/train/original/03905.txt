The most important characteristic to be a valuable team member is in my opinion that a person on the team is trustworthy. That means like you can trust everybody on the team, because if you want to be successful you need to rely on the other persons. And if there is somebody you cannot trust you wouldn't play with him, because you are not sure whether he will um also do his best for the success of the team. So it is difficult to play with a person you do not trust because, you just um have a bad feeling about it and that will intrude that your game, your game and this is the reason why I think that trust is the most valuable characteristic for team member.
