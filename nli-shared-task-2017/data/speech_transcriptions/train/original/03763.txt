Miss most, when I am away from home what I miss most is about, it's go about the uh same environment to my street. Uh I have two dogs uh in my house and uh two come on into my bed and sleep with me and when I'm away cause they are not there physically so I just cannot feel them when I'm asleep and I miss them a lot. And also, my bed. It's kind of made specially uh it's different. Uh mattress system so I feel it from my body that it's totally different when I am away like in a hotel bed so, so those two things that I miss most.
