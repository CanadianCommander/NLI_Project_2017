Uh the most interesting book read uh was uh Thomas More Utopia. I find it uh interesting because uh it was based on a different uh system uh of a country uh or world. And uh people lived different life uh a criminal uh life that was uh very uh interesting uh in the book. Uh people uh work and uh and share all they got and their life uh was based on working uh and taking uh their achieve goals from that life.
