As far as I'm concerned my favorite uh reading material is magazine during my spare time. Because first you can improve my English because I'm a new comer here in Canada. I like to read and do the local magazines which can and give me the real meaning of the local Canadian language, English. And the is especially true is best for my oral sp- oral speaking and English reading. And secondly I can get to <%> the news uh in Canada and worldwide because um in the newspaper I can find a lot of information very much related to the society or the community that I'm leaving and so this is giving me a real part of information that can um that I can derive. So this is reason why I like to read magazines.
