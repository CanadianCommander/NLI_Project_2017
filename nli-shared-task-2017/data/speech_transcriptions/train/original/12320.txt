I'm usually not away from my home but when I'm away from my home, the three things that I miss the most is food because uh we prepare the traditional Indian food and uh this food is kind of tasty and when I go out, I have to depend on fast food. The second that uh I miss when I leave home is my parents because I'm used to people being around me and I love my parents a lot. The third would be the comfort of my bed because uh usually the comforts offered at home may not be got when you're living away from home. Basically what happens is, when I'm away from home there are a lot of things.
