Um I got one hundred percent on my math test because I prepared this test about a week. Um the test was very hard for me and the test I knew that the test was very hard for me so I studied every night spending five hours a day. I when before the test I went to the math teacher every after and every time when I got the answer to my teacher from my teacher, I I thought that I am doing very well.
