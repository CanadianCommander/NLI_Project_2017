An interesting book I've read was the book called Grounding of the Swiss uh Airline. Um first reason why this book was very interesting for me was because it was top actual at its time. We had uh two or three years before, we had seen this grounding life on TV with all reports around it. Another reason why this I favor this book is because you have the possibility to see see behind the scenes of this history what happened. You know you had seen the different people who were interacting in this grounding story and this is why I prefer this book.
