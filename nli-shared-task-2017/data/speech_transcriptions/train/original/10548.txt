Mo- what I miss most when I'm away from home is usually my room. I miss my bed I miss sleeping comfortably in it holding my teddy bear close to me with the sheets wrapped around me. I also miss having privacy because usually when I'm away from home I share a room with my brothers and you can imagine how devastating it is sharing a room with three boys. I also like having all the room I can have on bed because I usually move a lot while I'm asleep. So what I miss most when I'm away from home is my room and my bed. That's it thank you.
