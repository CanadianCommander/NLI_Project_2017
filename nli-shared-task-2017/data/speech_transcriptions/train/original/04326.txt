One of the book which I found to be most interesting in my entire life till date is Alchemist written by Paulo Coelho. This book has inspired me deeper within. Alchemist is all about dreams, dreaming big, dreaming high and how to make all your dreams come true. It states the fact that when you <%> about something and you need it to happen the whole world conspires for you and gets you whatever you want. All you need is faith in yourself. Believe in your dreams and the fact that your dreams will come true will actually happen. Alchemist is one of the best books I would.
