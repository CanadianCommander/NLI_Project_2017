An an interesting book that I read was called The Saddle. Uh it was interesting first of all because uh you I couldn't expect what was coming next so I have to read more and more and at the end of the story I can find a philosophy that uh that that will change my world view. So because of two reasons I like the book. Another um okay let's go deeper in this two reasons uh the thing with expectations if a book is uh gives me what I want in the beginning then I don't get interested in that book that much as I go further because I'm going to knew what's going to come next and the thing with the philosophies what I get at the end of the story.
