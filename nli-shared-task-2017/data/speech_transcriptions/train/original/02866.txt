What I miss actually about uh going away from my home mostly is uh missing my family of course uh and mostly also my young brothers, my mom, my father. And you know sleeping in the bed it's different in your bed and sleeping in like in a hotel for, going away for a long time also you get that home sickness and from leaving your town or ho- your home. And another thing also is you love to be with your family and home in your house, in your home it's safe and there's there is a saying they go if you go east or west home is best. Thank you.
