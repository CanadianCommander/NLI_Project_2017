What I miss the most about my home when I'm away is my mother's food. My mother is a very good cook. She cooks very delicious food, not just the the taste but I think she uses very uh a wide variety of of food in order to cook the dish. When I'm away I'm too lazy to make that kind of food plus I don't have that ability. I must learn from her before I do go away. I do eat out when I'm away but I still consider my mom's food the best. That's what I miss the <%> most about my home.
