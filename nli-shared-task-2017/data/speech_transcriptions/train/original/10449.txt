Well actually the thing I miss most about my home when I'm away was my parents. Because one hand uh in the past when I feel very happy I will share all happiness with them. And really uh I think our home atmosphere is very great, great and very sweet and it is really very unforgettable. And also on other hand, when I meet difficulties and when I feel very sad my parents can persuade me out of the sadness. And also uh my parents will just encourage me to not give up the things if I just want to succeed. That's all.
