When I am away from my home I think what I would miss most is of course my family my boyfriend, people I'm close to and share with my life daily because I really love to talk. But of course I always miss my surrounding, I love love Hamburg, I loved to live there, I love my bed and it's hard for me to sleep somewhere just to just to different surrounding. And of course I would also miss my favorite <%>, I'm always going to Hamburg so leaving my home wouldn't be always be easy for me because I don't know my heart just hangs and all the things I'm familiar to and I am used to be surrounded with.
