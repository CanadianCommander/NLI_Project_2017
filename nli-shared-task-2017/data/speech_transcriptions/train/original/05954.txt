The thing I miss most if I am away from my hometown they will be the meals. The Chinese meal is famous for it's great taste and especially in my hometown it is very cheap. I remember one time I invite some foreign friend in my current and they were so impressed about the meal they have taste. They told me it's the most delicious food they ever had in the world. I'm so proud of the meal in my hometown and that's why I think the meal will be the most impressive thing for me. As a result I believe the meal will be the most <%> thing to me.
