Uh this is quite complicated because I actually don't read that much unless I find some time to read I prefer magazines and <%> information. Maybe natural science information or things like that. Um I don't know why but books and fantasy stories kind of um don't really interest me and um I don't know what to do with those so I better get some information from magazines.
