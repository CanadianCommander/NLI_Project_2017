I prefer magazines because I don't have so much free time after studying and if and so I like to read just one article um before I go to bed because I'm then always  too tired to read um twenty or thirty pages in a book. Um poetry is much too old for me and I I'm just not interested in and um if you read magazines you get an actual context and you uh get informed about news and um have kind of um entertainment in the most magazines. It's very um different themes within it. You don't do not only have one um one story.
