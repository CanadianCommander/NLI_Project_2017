Well, I will suggest my friend to visit Lima, which is the capital of the country Peru. It is located in the coast region of the country and I really appreciate the weather because it is really fine. Uh the beaches are best, are the best place in the city. There are many beaches where you can rest, play and enjoy the blue water and the fresh, the fresh air. It is really magical, really magic city and you enjoy it.
