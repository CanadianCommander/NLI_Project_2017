I got the opportunity uh last summer to go to Santa Barbara to a language school English. I was there for about two months and um it was very important for me because I can, I could improve my English skills. And um I think it's also very important because I'd like to study uh to study something with tourism, and there is important to speak English, very good. And it was also very nice to, to meet new people so.
