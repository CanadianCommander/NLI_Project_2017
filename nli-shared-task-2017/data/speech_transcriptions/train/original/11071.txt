Uh familiar is a quality that I think that makes someone a valuable member of a team. This is because first <%0:09.6> makes a good relationship good relationships with other people and it makes uh team work as uh one not as uh independent separate people. Also uh if  they friendly and become as a team they can work together and their motivation goes up and therefore work quality is going to go up. So I think friendliness is a value that makes someone a valuable member of a team.
