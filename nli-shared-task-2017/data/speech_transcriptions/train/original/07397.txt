If friends from other country were going to spend time in in my country I would suggest to visit them in my own city the Hyderabad because this uh the best city with uh ancient culture and lot of monuments and building which are really good and old. This this is the city which around uh four hundred years of history. And moreover this is the city where the people are <%> of the culture who can understand that people from any country, any reason, anything. So I suggest anybody who's visiting the city to come and see my city because they have lot to see like the Charminar, like the old poles, like the old roadways, the historic monuments like uh <%> all these things.
