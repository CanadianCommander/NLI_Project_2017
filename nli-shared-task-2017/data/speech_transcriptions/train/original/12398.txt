If I would li- If I would able to choose my own job or career I believe that most interesting option was would like to be an architect. Because I love the fact that I could be designing my own house and I would like also to help people improve the quality of living. I would also be able to work with a lot of different people such as uh building contractors, designers and, and mainly the clients. They'd all have different ideas of what they would like to live in.
