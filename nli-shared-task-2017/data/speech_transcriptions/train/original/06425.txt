The book I uh I did the book I like and I think it was interesting is Pride and Prejudice. It's uh it happened the the story happened in England and um and in about they started seventeen century and the most interesting people I think it is uh I think is Elizabeth and why he shouted to Anastasia he was the last man in the world I could ever ever pride to be married and I think although she is rude and she is smarts and she is confidence and uh is also a romantic romantic story about that.
