Um an interesting book I've read was um Kitchen by Banana Yashimoto. She is a Japanese writer and in her all her books, all her works she writes about little things, little happiness in our everyday lives. She doesn't write anything like awfully dramatic or like fantasy or like those um unrealistic things. She writes just regular things and I still enjoy it.
