I miss uh my mum's home cooked food when I'm away from home because uh my mum is a very good cook. She cooks uh very tasty, very delicious uh and uh the right amount of spices because uh we eat a lot of spicy food. So I can't get that food anywhere else so that's what I miss most uh when I'm away from home. And uh my mum also makes very good snacks uh for tea time and lunch and uh the breakfast time she has like a special breakfast items and uh she is very good uh at what she does in the kitchen. So uh all the time miss when I'm away from home is my mum's home cooked food. It's tasty, it's delicious and I can't replace it.
