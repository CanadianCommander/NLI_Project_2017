And a special opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity to be able to study dentistry. For me was a very important opportunity because it since I was uh, uh since I has been uh a child uh it was a very important goal in my life. So for me it was one of the most important opportunities I have in life was to get a further education and a very high education as was to study dentistry. It was very, very important for me for those all of the reason. Overall all, overall study dentistry was one of the main or major opportunities I have in life and was the most important for me.
