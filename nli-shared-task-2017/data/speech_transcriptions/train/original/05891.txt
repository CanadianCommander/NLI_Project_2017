I think um uh to work on a team, you have to have a social ability because uh when you work with a team you have to make compromises and uh maybe one person will not agree with some solutions and then you'll um be able to talk to um him or her about uh his opinion and the problem he has or she has and um on the other hand you can uh talk about the behavior of other people if you have um great social abilities and that's why I'm thinking this is the most important thing.
