The accomplishment that required me to work most hard is without any doubt the GMAT exam. I've done the GMAT exam three months ago in August and it is the most important accomplishment for me for a couple of reasons. First of all I needed to take this exam in order to enter in a mastering business administration in the United States. Second it was important for me because I would like to score higher points in order to improve my logic and maths skills.
