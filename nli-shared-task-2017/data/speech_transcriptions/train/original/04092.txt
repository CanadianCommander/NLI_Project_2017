I miss uh three things uh when I leave home. The fist thing is uh food uh cooking mother prepares then second is uh a transportation which my father provides and then the third is uh beautiful scenery which I could see in Japan. And my mother is uh first of all is really really good cook. I really miss her food and then my father is very kind to uh provide a ride to places where I want to go and then the place where I live it's uh very very beautiful surrounded by the the trees and then flowers in the seasons throughout the year.
