What I miss most in from my country is especially my friends and my family. I was very close to my friends and also to my family and now that I'm away from home uh I miss live with them I miss, I miss talk with them everyday and share my life with them. Also the food is another thing that I miss, because here the food is completely different. And also the weather the weather is different I live, I lived in Spain very sunny here is a bit rainy always so.
