I love reading the Ramayana. That is the book which I enjoy reading the most. The best part about that book is that it teaches us how to lead our life. It teaches us how to deal with our peers, how to deal with our parents and how to deal with everyone in the society. A lot of instances have been depicted in that uh book and they deal with the common instances that take place in our life. They also depict how should we behave in our family. For example in the Ramayana, when the mother asks the son to go to the forest, the son does not question her authority and he goes to the forest for fourteen years. There's a lot to learn from that book.
