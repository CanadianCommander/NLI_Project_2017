Well a very interesting book that I have read recently is the Hundred years of Solitude by One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. Now this book is quite interesting in my opinion because it is part of a revolution that is called magical realism. What I like about this book is that it has all sorts of fantastic features such as the revival of ghosts in the stories and the exaggeration of a character's personality. Now since I am a personal fan of fantasy in general, I am intrigued by the theme of this book and I also enjoy how the author describes the characters. Because of this because of this, this is one of my favorite books.
