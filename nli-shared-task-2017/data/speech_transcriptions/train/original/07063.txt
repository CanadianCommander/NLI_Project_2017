Uh I like to read novels in my free time because uh it doesn't it doesn't need uh it's more lif- it's more fictional based and because it's like nothing based to reality. It's something like all people uh they have their own problems and once they when they try to read the books they need to feel happy like uh some other place like in some other bay so that they're going to feel free and not think about the problems. It's supposed to be uh to make them feel at peace, to make their mind ease from all the tension they need. Most of the fictions like magical like Harry Porter. I'd like to use Harry Porter because it's like it's a completely different world it's not it's not existing and that's really fascinating to know that.
