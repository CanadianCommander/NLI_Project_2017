The things that I miss most when I'm away from home, it's the first the food that my mom made for me. Uh I've been eating the food for since I was kid is <%> me so well uh whenever I'm away from home and I don't feel good with the food there, I really miss the my mom made for me. And second is, my my sister. Since I was kid, I get along with my sister so well. I could I could confide everything to my sister, I tell her everything that happened today. I really miss the talk with my sister when I'm on whenever I'm away from home I really miss her with the talk that I have with my friends and family.
