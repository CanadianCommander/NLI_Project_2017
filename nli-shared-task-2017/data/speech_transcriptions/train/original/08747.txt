Well personally I think uh that the interesting books I have read is The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. That's because uh first of all is a book of of action uh with a lot of general events with uh a lot of mystery to discover and at the same time, I think uh uh it's a kind of book that offer us uh a new way to think uh about the races matter, uh giving us the opportunity to uh examine that in a new uh key.
