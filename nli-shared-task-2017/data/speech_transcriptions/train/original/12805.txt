An accomplishment that required me quite uh hard work was writing my thesis to get my degree in uh Foreign Languages in Literatures and that was hard because I um it was about um Portuguese and mistakes and not that material was written before they had to abroad uh in Portugal and study there directly in the libraries. Uh and it was important because I wanted to um graduate very good final grade. So I really worked hard and with all my strength and effort in order to write a good thesis.
