One of the accomplishments I've had to um achieve in the past would be a series of exam which I'm required quite a lot of work. Um the reason why it was important for is is that I had to be registered with the NASD in the US to be able to um fulfill my job requirements of being an equity sales person in an investment bank. And and again it was very challenging because I had to um be able to study for the exam while the same time working close to fourteen hours a day. So that again made it much more difficult to complete the the test at the same time.
