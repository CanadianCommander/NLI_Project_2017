An interesting book I have read is Harry Potter. I think it's interesting how is very <%5.8> and how it shows how magicians would study and would learn about portions and stuff magicians would use. I also think uh it's very clever how they live and how the author depicts them as regular people but with special powers. Uh a good example is how they go to Hogwarts School and study portions.
