Uh the career I would choose as my perfect uh area would be research specifically organic research, organic chemistry research. The reasons I studied first uh chemistry I became interested in the fact that you can make almost any possible molecule if you know the proper conditions and you have the proper tools. So that would be my ideal career working in research and development in organic chemistry.
