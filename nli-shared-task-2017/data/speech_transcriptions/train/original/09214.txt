When I'm away home, I miss first of all my family, my parents. And uh other than that, I think I miss uh okay, my it may strange but uh I miss my bed and my pillow. Every time I come home uh I feel that I'm very happy, that I can lie on my bed. I- it's it's it's a strange it's strange that I I think every every thing every time every time I feel that way and okay <%> okay. Anyway, everything familiar to me put in my room. That that is.
