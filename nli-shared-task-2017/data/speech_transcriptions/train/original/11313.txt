There are several accomplishments from my childhood till now, but the accomplishment that I consider the most important is producing a paper on the <%> distress relief in <%> process that is concerned to our mechanical engineering department. I find this accomplishment is sort of pride to me because I have worked really hard for several months in order to do this. In this process of learning, I have visited several professors and have uh browse in the Internet and I've gone to different libraries, people and also I can go to the practical experiments that, to prove this theory. And when I have obtained the first price by this paper but have been produced by me, I feel really satisfied. It gave self con- confidence. I said this is important.
