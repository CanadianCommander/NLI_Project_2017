I prefer the novels in my free time because it's uh very easy to read novels and it's they are very good like stories and it's very useful for time <%>. Uh it feels after reading novels I feel fresh and energetic so that I can carry on my work again and means I can carry on my work again to do my job once again and do it properly and accurately so that my mind is every time fresh when I start my work after the break. So it's good for me to read novels. So I pick on novels to read in my break.
