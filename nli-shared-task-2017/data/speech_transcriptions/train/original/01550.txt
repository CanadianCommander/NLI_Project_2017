About the seas, I like to read the books about the seas because I'm in the club activities of scuba diving and I'm not very, I'm not quite sure about what the seas are so by reading books about seas, I can uh I can expand my knowledge about seas more and I can gain courage in scuba diving much more so I like reading about seas uh in my in my free time.
