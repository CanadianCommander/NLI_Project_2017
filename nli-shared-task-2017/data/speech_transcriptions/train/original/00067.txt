Well I saw the Harry Potter as the best story I have ever read, I have ever read before. Because I have a career in <%> I've always seen something like superman kicking and busting the enemies and like flash out with the princess and this book is like it can be happen in reality and it can be. And so much coping there is coming <%> but it really can happen. That's why the reason that I rate this the best book I have ever read.
