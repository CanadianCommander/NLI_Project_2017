I did work hard to prepare my thesis for my masters studies. For that I made experiments and also I did a computer program. Um preparing masters thesis is also uh very hard because it requires a advanced work and it requires very uh a lot of time. To doing this I ask for help for from the Ph.D. students, from my supervisor and it's very important for me because uh by this way I will be able to start the Ph.D. studies and um this thesis work shows how I can understand scientific studies.
