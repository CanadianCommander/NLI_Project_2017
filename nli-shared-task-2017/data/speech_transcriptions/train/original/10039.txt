I think the most special opportunity that was given to me was that I um uh could attend um a gymnasium, a gymnasium I I was the only one of my family who um attended a gymnasium. Um no one there, my father nor my mo- nor my mother um could attend a gymnasium member not given this opportunity and um I think by attending the gymnasium I reached a level um to attend uh university later. Um this means that I would um have great opportunities um later when um look for job or um something else.
