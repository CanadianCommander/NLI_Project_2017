So one good opportunity that I got in the past was uh to be a pharmaceutical sale representative with <%>. <%> is major drug company that's uh produce drug uh in the United State and well know everywhere in the world. I did have the opportunity to join this business as a pharmaceutical sales representative and, but unfortunately I did not get this opportunity. It was a good one because it could help me a lot you know to improve my personality and make a lot of money for myself and my whole family but I'm sorry I didn't.
