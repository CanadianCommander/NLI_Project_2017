I like to read poetry. Poetry is my best kind of reading because I can expand more vocabulary and I can learn more things about life. I like to read poetry because my father always writes poetry and now I started to write some kind of poetry. I like tragic poetry because it makes me, because it makes me uh read more and to be more interested in reading and continuing reading the poet.
