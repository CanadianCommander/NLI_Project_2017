When I am away from my home of course I will miss my parents very much. You know what when I was born and my parents always getting hard work, and because they want to make me um, make me have a good live situation, and have a good education. And you know and when I am uh preparing for an exam, for examinations and when I'm re- I read at night very late, my parents always will give m- give me a bottle of warm milk, and you know it's not just a warm milk and it shows they love me. So when I'm away from home of course I will, I will miss my parents very much.
