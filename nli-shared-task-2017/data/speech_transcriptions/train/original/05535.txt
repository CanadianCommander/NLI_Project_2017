A major accomplishment I had was acquiring straight A's in my <%>. It was a big accomplishment because it required me to work very hard for four straight terms and that required lots of study time and um lots of time um uh preparing for the test and doing good on tests and doing good on many quizzes and um like um just um relaxing uh not relaxing and spending time studying. and that was an accomplishment because it's not achieved very easily.
