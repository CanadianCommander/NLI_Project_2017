In my opinion, honesty is a very valuable uh quality that people have to develop uh for many reasons. First, uh in a, well, in the, in the relationship at works, you, you have to be really honest to build this relationship and to help people uh having confidence into, uh into the others and to, to know that they can rely on the other people, but also in your person life, uh and with the, the team of your friends, uh you can build friendship with someone if you are not honest and uh if uh we can rely on you.
