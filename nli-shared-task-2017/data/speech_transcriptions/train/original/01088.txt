Two years ago I was in the university of Nice and I have been given the opportunity to go to Paris to study in <%12.1> Paris. And it was very important to me because it allowed me to go to a very famous school and also to know Paris and it's surroundings and to live alone which is an important thing. And also being at the school will allow me to go abroad in the next years something that I couldn't do without university.
