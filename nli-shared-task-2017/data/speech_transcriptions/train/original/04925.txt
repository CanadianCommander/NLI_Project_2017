Uh I used to have an eating disorder and then really I, I need, I needed someone to talk to cause actually uh eating disorder is not well known in our country. So I got the book of Anorexia Diaries. Uh it was really useful for me. It was uh about a girl who had an ea- uh anorexia. So uh it taught me how to live with my uh problem, and how to face it and how to look into my deeper issues rather than just, cause uh my disorder. Uh and actually it was really good cause it it came out of uh, it ca- it came out of uh an actual real problem and a girl uh close to my age facing the same problem.
