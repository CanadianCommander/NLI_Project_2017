Well I read <%> when I was realty young at the age of five or six maybe and I like the book because it's more of a fantasy world you go into and it makes you feel more out of this uh world of so many problems and like the courage and the actions and all the dramatic thing in that book really makes me more appealing, appeals to my senses and it's more of uh nice book I guess.
