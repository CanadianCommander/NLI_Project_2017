If a friend of mine came to visit my country, the first place that I would suggest that he go to is the pyramids. I choose the pyramids because it's a wonderful monuments that express the ability of the <%14.9> to build huge monument. The second place where I would suggest that he would visit is <%26.8>, this is a wonderful place where the view of the sea and the sun is wonderful and uh the weather is very good. I think that's all the places I would suggest him to visit in my country.
