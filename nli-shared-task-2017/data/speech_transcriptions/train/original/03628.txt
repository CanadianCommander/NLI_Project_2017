Last year at the end of semesterI had exams coming up and I knew that it was going to be hard for me to take those exams because I had to at the same time take care of other responsibilities such as for example taking part in sports team, playing a trumpet, playing an orchestra and I basically sat down and worked very hard to accomplish this aim which I set myself. And after this two weeks of hard studying I took the exams although I had a bad feeling after the exams when I got the results back it was a um superb results and I was very glad.
