An interesting book which I have read lately is Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. I feel this book is very interesting by the way Chetan Bhagat has portrayed the incidents by these five friends who are studying in the, in the most prestigious institute of India, The Indian Institute of Technology, The IIAT. These five friends get into many troubles, ups and downs in the university and Chetan Bhagat has portrayed them very interestingly. The, the way these five friends get into trouble by, by the way they are start, they start to leak the paper and they got caught. The most interesting part of the boo-, novel, I found was that. Chetan Bhagat novel Five Point Someone was very interesting.
