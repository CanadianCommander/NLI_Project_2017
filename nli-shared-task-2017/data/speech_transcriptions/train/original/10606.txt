The opportunity that was given to me was uh the opportunity to play the main role in the actor that uh was made at a school in the uh Christmas hospital. This uh opportunity was important because uh it gave me the chance to demonstrate my ability in uh well playing uh parts in theater and uh also let me uh achieve um, uh, uh an important role in the theater company of the school.
