I miss most about my home is the guidance from my parents. When I've have lived out for the last two years I've seen that my parents are away and I'm not able to get the exact guidance which they used to give me when they we were together. In times of difficulty I have to really call them, let them know about the response but I've seen that the guidance that they used to give me during living together was much better than being uh than getting after talk on phone. I see that along with the guidance from parents some of them love of parents is also missing.
