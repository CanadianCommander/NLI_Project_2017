When I am away I miss most about my home is my bedroom because firstly I can do everything in my bedroom for example to surf on the Internet or to read the books or to, or something else and secondly because they had my bedroom just like small library and I'm a person who like read books um mostly so if I in the bedrooms I can get the every books just I want it. And uh finally because that I think and um my bedroom is an a very comfortable places and I can cry and smile very loudly. I can do anything in the my bedroom so I think my bedroom is mi- I will miss mostly.
