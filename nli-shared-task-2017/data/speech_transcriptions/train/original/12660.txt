The most I miss about my home is my family, um the meetings that we have together, my friends and the outings that we went on. I also miss um the university I used to study in, in my undergraduate, and um all the, the projects that we worked on, and um the trips that um that we took. It was v, it was very lovely, and it's very nice to know everybody in the place that you used to live in or at home. We also went thr- um I also miss about my home um the traditions and the culture that are there.
