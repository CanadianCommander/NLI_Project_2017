Okay so what I miss most about uh my home when I am away is uh first uh the city. Uh because it's uh I live uh near Paris so it's a great city and uh you know the part of uh the world uh there aren't uh so beautiful city. Uh secondly uh friends. You can take friends with you and uh that's uh the main thing I, I will miss. And the finally uh the parents.
