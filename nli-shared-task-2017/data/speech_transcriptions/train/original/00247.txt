I would definite take my friends uh if uh come and visit my country. Cities where probably took them would be uh definite Florence as a first city to go. Is definitely the most beautiful one we have in our country. Um then I would probably go to Venice 'cause even if I don't like it that uh or if even if is not my favorite one, it's definitely one city from Italy it has to be seen. Seen because it's a usually is romantic, has something to offer that no other city can in the world. After that I would definitely go to Rome, is the capital of our country and uh for sure is the most valuable one that we have.
