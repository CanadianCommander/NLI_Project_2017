The most interesting book I've ever read was Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It's main character is named Scarlett O'Hara. She's confident and very adventurous and ambitious. When I was reading the book, I thought that she was a lot like me and I guess that's the main reason why I'm attracted so much to this book. It shows how people changed during the war and how people go through the war with their each and unique way. This is the main reason why I really like this book and this is a, and that's about it.
