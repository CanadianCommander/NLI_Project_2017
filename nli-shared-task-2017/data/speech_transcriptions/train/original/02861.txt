The accomplishment that encouraged me to work hard to spending a year in Canada without any problem for several reasons. First of all, I didn't have absolute control over me since I was a student. However I didn't neglect the work, I had to do so. And I could improve my English much. Also even though I was missing my family and friends, I tried get all of it friends I made in Canada. So I was so proud of me. These are the reasons why this most, this was the accomplishment.
