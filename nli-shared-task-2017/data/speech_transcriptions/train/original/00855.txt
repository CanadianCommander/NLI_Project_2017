<%> and about one point five students appear in this examination from all over India and in this examination I got eight hundred rank and which is actually a pretty good rank and um this is due to my hard work and this is important to me because after going to IT I could shift my personality very well. I've learned so many things that I couldn't have learned from any local and training colleges. And then I learned what is the value of hard work and then what it can get you in long run. Uh well I love being in IT and I this is one of the accomplishment that required me to work very very hard from day and night and uh I was working hard very much for this accomplishment.
