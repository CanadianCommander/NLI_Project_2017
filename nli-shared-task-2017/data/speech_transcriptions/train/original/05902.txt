I would recommend it's called <%3.3>. It's a book about, uh telling people and one German guy who is married, get married in this family. And I like it because first of all it's funny any it creates a nice atmosphere to whom I'm reading it. And second there um, you get lots of information about Italian uh population, culture, people and how they correspond with the neighborhood countries. And so that's why I would recommend this book for everyone, uh it's just funny and amazing.
