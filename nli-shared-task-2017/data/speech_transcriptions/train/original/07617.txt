Basically my basic aim to work very hard was to um go abroad and study more and more to have more and more knowledge and the other important reason is to have my family my children and everyone more have more accomplished and everything so that they they have everything in life. So they should they shouldn't be any shortage of anything, so that makes  me to work very hard for my and myself and my family. Basically the aim to work very hard inspired by my religion also because my religion makes me to provoke to do impossible things and faith is in me to deliver good things that are very critical time, thank you.
