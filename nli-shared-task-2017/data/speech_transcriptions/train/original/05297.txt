Recently I read about a book talking about the interpretations and translation. It was very fascinating for me because my uh final goal is to be an interpreter at a in a national conference and it shows um it have an answer that I had always wondering about and it shows uh that how that where interpreter's life is and it is the way how I should prepare to achieve my goal, that was very interesting and it just make me more uh concrete to harden to over to my dream.
