What I miss the most about uh my home when I'm away is being with my parents and being all taken care of. Uh I do not have to worry about anything, um my food is ready, my laundry is ready uh all I do is just uh sleep, eat and uh just go have fun with my friends. Uh I feel the love around my parents, uh I feel like I'm alone or alienated so uh also being not have to worrying about my financial status. I can take money from my parents whenever I want or I need.
