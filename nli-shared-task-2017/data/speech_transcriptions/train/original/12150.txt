The biggest opportunity that was given to me was when I was be, uh when I became the captain of my s, one of my school teams. It was a very new experience and a very good one. It uh gave me the respect and it helped me in making the strategy skill and having the full control on the game. Uh it was a very special moment for me and, and being the captain I uh could decide what to do and how to make stuff and stuff.
