Uh team spirit a person with this quality can help to motivate a group can help to unite can help can help to unite a particular force and fight back the designed task and like in a game, a particular captain he can help motivate his group and fight back a particular opponent team which is very much strong in the opponent case. So uh leadership and motivation, leadership motivation and <%> team spirit are the most important in the wider part of any team which are required to perform and show how much we can do. Thank you.
