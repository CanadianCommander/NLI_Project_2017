Accomplishment I have chosen is learning German. I have  been learning German for five years. It's quite a complicate language base all the time. Um and it has been really, this is hard for me to learn German because last year I went to Germany to finish my degree and to write a  diploma thesis. So all the diploma these and all exams um in Germany were made in German. And I need that ha- I need to have a complete  knowledge of the language to finish with success the year.
