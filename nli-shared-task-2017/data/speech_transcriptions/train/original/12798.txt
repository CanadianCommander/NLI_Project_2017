I mainly read novels. It's compared to poetry or magazines. I don't know exactly why but it's happened like that. Probably from my mother who is a great reader of novels. So I find many books in my my house and I start reading them and then I really became very fond of novels because I think that they can create life, lives that doesn't exist but in they they come to existence to you. It's like we're persons that you know even if they are fictional characters. So at the end of the book it's like you can have more friends than you had before starting reading the book even if they are not real but they are in your mind they are more real than within the reality. So novels I think they are.
