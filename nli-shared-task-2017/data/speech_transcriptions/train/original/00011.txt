Not at home I would um miss um, uh the most my family because I have uh my mother my sister, because I live together with them, and we have a um deep contact to each other. My pets so my cat and my dog. After all my friends I would miss because um we have a weekly meeting in a pub and their awakening at the week, and what happened in their life. I would miss that because I like the contact to other people.
