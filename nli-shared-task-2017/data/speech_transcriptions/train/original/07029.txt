I believe that one of the most important qualities that a member of a team should have is leadership.

For example in case a member can't do her or his appropriate responsibility. Another important quality that a member of a team should have is honesty and transparency. These two qualities are very valuable to the whole benefit of the group and the information flows better. Third, it is very important.
