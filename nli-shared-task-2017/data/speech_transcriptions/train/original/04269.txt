So uh it was written by an intern in maybe one hundred, early in nineteen hu- nineteen so- <%27.2>, nineteen century, uh <%28.9> early in nineteen century. But uh now I sti- I can still enjoy this novel because uh he said uh that is very difficult and it was so. In addition um, life is um very complicated so, the time has passed but it's very, it's very interesting.
