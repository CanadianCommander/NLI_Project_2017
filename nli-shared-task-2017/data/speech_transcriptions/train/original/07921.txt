At the university where I am doing Master in Business Administration, my pro- my professor has brought me to, brought to my notice and to the fellow students about an upcoming opportunity to serve the country. So the opportunity's about serving the country by participating in voluntary works for the hurricane Katrina. So when he explained the importance of that, I readily agreed for it and I also motivated several students to join that. The importance of that is that we're serving the country by donating our labor and also to helping the people by better understanding the people. I love this country and I served it.
