I would like to be a musician because as musician I could uh find uh a way of expression uh that suites my personality and my uh likes. Um another thing is that I would like to travel and uh I know that as a musician one can travel uh a lot. Um also uh this uh professional will allow me to do several works uh or to perform several tasks uh like humanitarian tasks. Uh and to become probably uh a voice of uh, of the people that's around me and my community.
