I would prefer to read novels in my spare time. I usually read novels because they are easy to read and it's easy to follow up what's going on and it's pretty much interesting uh they are very easy to read. that's because uh usually uh they are um topics are not like scientific uh things or anything related with uh education. Uh and uh they are interesting because always in every novel there is a different topic to to read about as well as this uh it is also would be good to read magazines, poetry or anything else. Well it's just uh good and has that nice time to read novels.
