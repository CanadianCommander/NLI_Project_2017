If a friend of mine um would uh would like to spend time in my county, I would like to take him uh to Siena in Tuscany. I think it's the most beautiful city in Italy. I've been studying there for six years for um for my university and uh I like the peace and quite of the city. You can have in contact with nature. And uh furthermore the food is tasty and uh and uh and healthy. And uh um since I think that being uh out in the nature is the most important thing in uh everyones life, I would suggest the city uh in in Italy.
