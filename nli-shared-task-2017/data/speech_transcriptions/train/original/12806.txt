The last book I read was <%> and uh <%> um and yeah I know I don't remember the second author but was about evolution. Uh those people are doctors and scientific and they have done a lot of research about um genetic evolution and how uh what we are is uh inscribed in our genes and it's really interesting because it was related to religion, to what we believe in and uh the other the the future of uh of mankind and a lot of ethics about uh this um uh The Firs- The Second World and the Nazis and lots of.
