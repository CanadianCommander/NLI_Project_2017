The book I would like to talk about is Philip Pullman's Dark Chronicle Series, the second one, Subtle Knife. This series actually um about magic, about with witchcraft, and um it is fascinating because it explores how children can actually um change or have a say in uh humans world. A man um humans world and um they can actually take lead and responsible about their actions. And this done through magic and through friendships.
