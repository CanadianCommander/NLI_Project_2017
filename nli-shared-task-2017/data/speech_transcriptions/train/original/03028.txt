If I could have any job or career I would probably choose to be an ambassador, an ambassador uh of the US to another country say in the Middle East or probably Turkey, which is my favorite country. Because I love to be in an international atmosphere and I love to know about different cultures, and represent my country, and I would love to learn about um the relationship between two countries and to be that link that can unite two cultures and two countries and unite them in a peaceful way.
