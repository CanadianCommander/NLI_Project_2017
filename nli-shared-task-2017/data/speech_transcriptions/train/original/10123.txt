I prefer to read uh novels because first of all I read a novel and I can smile and cry with the roles the novel's mentioned. And secondly I can learn some knowledge which I never been known before and to witness some city had been mentioned in the novel. And uh first um and the last uh I can uh take the experience from the goal of the novels and form my future uh you know in my future career and I learn from the role of the novel. That's why I prefer to.
