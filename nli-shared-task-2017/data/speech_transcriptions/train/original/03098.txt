I miss most about my pet dog uh in my home. Um the dog came to house uh when I was a Junior High School student and I raised the dog uh since, I raise the dog since uh it was a little baby so I know a lot about it. Um the dog is now uh thirteen years old and she is getting uh very, uh high old dog uh but she's very healthy and uh when I go to walk with it, uh it run very fast.
