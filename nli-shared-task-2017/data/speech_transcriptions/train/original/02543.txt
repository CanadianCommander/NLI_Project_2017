I suggest that you should visit Argentina um the city I live and it's Buenos Aires. And there's many buildings and there is many places you like go and like there's there's a lot of different culture and especially and then aside of this there's really dancing show that's called Tango and I really love it. And yeah that's like the main culture they have in Argentina and I think it's a very good place to visit. So like plus it's not uh a lot of weather they have. Like when when it is winter in the states it's summer. So it's really nice too visit.
