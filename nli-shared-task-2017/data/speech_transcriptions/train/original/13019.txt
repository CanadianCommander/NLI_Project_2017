Well I have to admit that I read often magazines even if it's not great literature but it deals with famous people's life and it's kind of funny which is not really interesting. Most of all, I like to read novels. It it's really interesting in sense it it deals with people's uh feelings. It can help you in your life. Um um sometimes, I read poetry but it's hard to read. One have to has one have to have um knowledge to read poetry.
