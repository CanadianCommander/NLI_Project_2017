What I do miss most about my home when I'm away, I miss about my families. Uh from my experience I was uh in the United States for four years and I haven't seen them for uh more than three years and I miss so much and I think about my family all the time and especially when we're having dinner with my whole family they will miss me. My mom and my mom's cooks and uh also uh when I was with house family my house that was uh ta- asking about my family so.
