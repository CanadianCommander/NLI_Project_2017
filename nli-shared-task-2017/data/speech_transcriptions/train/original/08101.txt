My special opportunity uh that was given to me is meeting jazz musicians in New York City. And uh first of all um I was uh it made me more interest in the jazz music and before I played a trombone in my school but I more uh want wanted to know about the structure of uh every great musician and second of all it makes me uh more interested in speaking English. I can make more conversation with him so and it's really good opportunity for me because I can uh improve and I can into the new world.
