If there were friends coming from another country I would suggest them to visit Istanbul as the first destination in Turkey. Uh the main reasons would be that it is the biggest city and one of the oldest cities in Turkey and it has a lot of museums as uh as for tourists to visit. And then it would have plenty of restaurants and uh shopping centers for uh, for touristic attrac- attractions. And then lastly, uh simply Istanbul is in my opinion the most beautiful city of Turkey because it has the, it has a beautiful street cutting through and it's beautiful to dine next to it.
