If I could choose any job or any career I would choose a career in the financial industry. Um this is because my, my major in uh, in uh, in college was mathematics. And uh during my studies I realized that I to, I didn't want to go on and research in mathematics and I wanted to find a way to apply, to apply it in uh, in, in the real world. And I think that the financial industry provides um interesting and challenging problems to solve, and it's the perfect field to apply the mathematics tool that I learned during uh my university years.
