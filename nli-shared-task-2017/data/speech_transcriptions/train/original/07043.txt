The book that was very much interesting to read is Mahatma Gandhi's Life because he's father of Indian nation and he fought for freedom. He is such a great man that everyone should know about him as he led a very casual life apart from others. He he plays a role model to everyone and I am very much interest interested in learning this book because.
