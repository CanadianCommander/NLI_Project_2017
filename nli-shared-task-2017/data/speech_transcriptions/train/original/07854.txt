In my free time I like to read uh the newspaper which um I get every week to my dad and because um there is a lot of information which I can get through this newspaper it's about political topics and economical topics and it's also about background information. So um it's not just what happened in this week but also how the process have developed over maybe years and um what I also get um <%> of information from this weekly newspaper is about literature, about music and films. So it's a broad variety of topics they offer in this newspaper which is why I really like to read it a lot and it's also about um society very much.
