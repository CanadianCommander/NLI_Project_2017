Um uh a recent book that I read was Blink which was written by Malcolm Gladwell. The reason why the book was interesting was that it touched upon it had touched upon a subject which uh is of interest to me as well. I've actually thought a lot about how people create um instantaneous perceptions or initial perceptions about people when they meet them for the first time and the book actually touched upon the same subject. How in a blink of a second, blink of a moment you form perceptions, you come to conclusions about a particular uh person, about a particular idea with limited information. All you have in that blink second is.
