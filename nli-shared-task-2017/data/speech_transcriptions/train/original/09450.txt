A quality that I think makes one a valuable member of a team is definitely sportsman spirit. Firstly, it is very important, because if sportsman spirit is not there, the player will be playing for himself rather than playing for the complete team. And this will be uh not in the benefit of the team as the team will lose. A person with, a player with a sportsman spirit tries to win the tournament rather than improving his own score. And all the members in the team have that team spirit, they will, the team can never lose any of the game and even if someone loses a game, because of any kind of mess up in between, it definitely, the team spirit will help the person to begin his strength and create the next game more confidently.
