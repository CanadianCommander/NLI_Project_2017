Uh if I was asked to choose between uh novels, magazines, poetry and in my free time, I would choose magazines definitely. Uh this is because that um in magazines there are headlines so I could pick up the parts that I want to read specifically. For example, I have interest in history so I would I would probably pick up a history magazine and I have interest in Chinese history so I would read uh specifically about probably communism in China. Uh but however I couldn't do this on novels or poetry.
