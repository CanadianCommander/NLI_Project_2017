An accomplishment I recognize as a as the most important has been the development together with the professor from university of the system for calculating <%11.0> calculus. And it was, to me it was very important because I didn't know the, I didn't have the programming skills and which I needed and I had to develop this on the way. But I think it was, it was great I learned a lot and the results uh were successful. That I feel really proud of this, and uh and I'm really happy about the uh all I learned on this process.
