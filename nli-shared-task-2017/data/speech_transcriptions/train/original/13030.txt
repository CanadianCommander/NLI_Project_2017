The book that I read was Global Agenda written by uh David Held from the Luminous School of Economics. It's quite an interesting book after he give uh good overview of the situation in Europe and in terms of economic, political and social um aspects. Uh it took over the position that globalization can encourage European uh economies to grow and foster development in a in a much greater way than it has happen under the United States uh regime uh after the cold war was ending in nineteen eighty nine. Um I thought it was quite well structured <%> clearly spoken and it was quite <%> in terms of being more able to, it try to cover scope towards uh talking the <%> rather than uh specifically.
