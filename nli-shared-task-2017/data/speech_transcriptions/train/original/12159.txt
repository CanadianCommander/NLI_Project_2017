Uh well I uh will suggest him to uh, uh visit uh Florence, Roma, Venice or other art cities uh especially for uh the artistic monuments, uh monuments they offer. And then if he is a person who wants to have fun, I would uh, uh tell him to visit Milan during winter times there are a lot of Discos uh. And he could also go to Naples uh or to Siris Sardinia to the beautiful sea side places if he wants to uh relax. So I think Italy offers a lot of good opportunities uh according to.
