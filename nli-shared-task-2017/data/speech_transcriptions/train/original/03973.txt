I highly recommend um the Seoul. The Seoul is the capital of south Korea. Uh Seoul represents a whole country. Seoul is not only historical but also amusing and there are a lot of palaces so you can learn um what the history of Korea is. And also uh there are uh a lot of concert place so you can enjoy every time you want and there is a huge amusement park like Disneyland so can enjoy uh many riders. The city is very interrelated.
