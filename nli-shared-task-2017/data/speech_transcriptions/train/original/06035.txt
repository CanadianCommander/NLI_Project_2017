If a friend of mine from another country happens to visit my country I would definitely uh take him or her to Istanbul uh it is the most famous city of Turkey and it has so many historical places to see and natural scenery. Uh it is it's a cosmopolitan city and you can find um many people love people from ethical minorities. And yes it has a wide wide range of transportation means you can travel easily.
