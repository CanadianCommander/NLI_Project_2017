The accomplishment for which I had to work really hard and was very uh dear to me was uh when I appear for the national level examination which is conducted by the examination board uh uh when I was in the tenth grade. And for this particular particular accomplishment I had to put in a steady time of around four to five hours every day for almost two months and at the end of it when I got my results I had to come at the second place in the school which was a very heartening that to me and which actually pushed me to pursue my further education dreams. So this is one accomplishment for which I work really hard and is very dear to me.
