Uh what I miss um most about when I am apart from the home is that uh I, first of all I miss my parents. And the second I miss my pets. And the third I miss a secure and healthy food. Uh first I will discuss each of them at uh, in detail. Uh first coming to the parents uh from the childhood onwards I used to live with my parents. I love my parents very much. They are so advisive, the first of all. And the second thing they are so understanding to me. They understand my problems. Always gives my a nice advices and uh even helps whenever I needed. And the second one is pets. I love my pet very much. He'll understand my pe- feelings. I mean the pet is very nice to me and uh it is good friend to me. And the third one is secure food. When I'm outside I'm not sure I'm getting <%41.2> food. So these are the problems which I have when I away from home.
