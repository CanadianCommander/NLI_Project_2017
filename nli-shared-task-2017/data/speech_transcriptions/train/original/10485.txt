I choose and if I choose any job I choose work as a lawyer because I studied law in the university, and I finished studying law in university and now uh I'm as a lawyer work as a lawyer in my country. And uh I love law so much because some people need to protect now and some, some person talk about them, about them and their problem or something like this. And thought it's, though it's so, so important in this life because there is a lot of problem in the life for people or, or country or something.
