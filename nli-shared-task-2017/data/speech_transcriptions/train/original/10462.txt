Well I must I uh I'm more interested in inn reading magazines because I think a magazine is uh has many articles that not only focusing uh in only one topic also you can read uh articles uh about sports science uh music uh art. And I think magazines is for me it's better to read because I can engage my ability to to know when another areas when I'm not related and despite I am studying medicine I like to read another type of issues another type of of problems that the that are in magazines that's why I prefer read magazines.
