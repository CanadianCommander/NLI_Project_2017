Um I had one special opportunity from my mother uh that was to come to the America and study and reach for my goal. Um before I came to here, before I decided, I almost quit and give up give up for the decision because um I'm thinking I have to work and make some money for my family, but as my mother say I'm still young and I have so much opportunity to come out and see the whole world then you can decide what you want. So I decided to come to the America and study about education to reach my goal.
