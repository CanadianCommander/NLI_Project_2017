I feel very safe uh when I'm at home and the most important thing which I'm uh when I'm out uh what amazes uh what amazes me ambiance, the love the love which my parents showed towards me. And uh I miss the uh brotherly love, um I miss brotherly love and what then what is most important in the home is that we feel safe, that which is not uh there when we are outside. So basically I feel that when we are away from the home, uh we need to lack safety uh uh we need to lack safety uh we are in the mother's hands. So what is more important is that the ambiance and the love, what we like, what I like.
