Now I would like to talk about what I think that makes someone a valuable member of a team. Now, I think that someone who is good at communicating could be a good member of a team, because in a team, we need to communicate. And communication is a very important factor to succeed. So if there's someone who is good, very good at communicating, it is very easy to unite ourself in a team and which makes very easy to work on or to aim for something. So, I think that is a very, very good quality to have in a.
