One qualities I think that it is important in value in the member of a team is the active participate, uh not afraid to do anything. Uh for example in I have my classmate at school, we used to have some projects and I like the people, they're always looking around you know. I think the important thing in a person is confidence. Confi- why confidence? Because when you're confident, you can say whatever you think in the way you feel and I think in order to do that, you can success in life. If you're not confident in life, you were swearing to somebody told you whatever you need to do.
