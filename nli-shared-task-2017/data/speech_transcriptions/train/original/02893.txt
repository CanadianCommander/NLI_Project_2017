Friends from another country visit me I would take them to Frankfurt uh the city where I come. Um there are two reasons I would show them Frankfurt. Firstly, um I know many places, individual places that the most tourist guides don't known. And I could show them um aspects of the city and sites of the city that probably no one else uh could could show them. Secondly I think uh uh Frankfurt is a very interesting city because of known history. First it used to be one of the most beautiful medieval cities and uh because <%> part of it is in the <%> but it also has great new buildings after the Second uh built after the Second World War and this combination is great amazing.
