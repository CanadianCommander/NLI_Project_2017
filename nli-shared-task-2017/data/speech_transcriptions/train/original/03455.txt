If I recommend to my friends uh to go to somewhere to in my country I would recommend to go to Tokyo in my country. There are two reasons, first of all uh it is historical place. For example there are a lot of temple and shrines. Uh my friends would enjoy my county's culture. The second reason for my opinion is that uh in Tokyo there are a lot of good place to eat. For example uh they can peop- people can it Sushi and the Soba. Um it uh they will enjoy Japanese traditional food.
