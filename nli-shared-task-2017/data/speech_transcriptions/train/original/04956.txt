I usually um uh read the magazines on newspapers uh especially English ones like uh The Economist or uh the Time. Um because I'm studying economics and I think it's really important to be aware of it economics and politics issues when you're a student. Um and it also open your mind on what's happening in the world which is really important to avoid to be um only uh uh in your place like thinking in your own language and thinking the way you're think.
