An accomplishment that I acquired to work very hard was an annual festival called, it's called IT and impulse. I worked very hard because first of all, it was an annual fest which just happens once in an year. Secondly, it was a ten lag budget and we had to gather scons sponsorship near about five lags and we worked hard and we got the entire sponsorship up six lags, which was a great accomplishment and I was highly admired and appreciated by the uh higher administration in the college. It was very important to me because it gave me a sense of confidence and a sense of being uh the real uh me and a sense of how much can I, how much I worked hard uh to achieve this thing.
