I prefer reading the newspaper or some magazines. Well I don't like uh reading novels. A newspaper is it's it's very interesting because you can read about the happenings around the world each day and my interest is in political things also the sport part and I I have another magazine it's called <%> in ZÃ¼rich, the this magazine appears once in week and you can read through the whole week and it's, there are some articles about the happenings around the world. So you don't have to to pay everyday to buy everyday a newspaper. So I like magazines too.
