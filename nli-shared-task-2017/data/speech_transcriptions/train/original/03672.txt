India Institute of Technologies, IETs as they are known in India, are one of the premium engineering institutions, not only in India but also in the world. The entrance examination for getting into the IETs is known as the Joint Entrance Examination, or JEE. This, getting into the IETs through the JEE in the first attempt I consider it to be my biggest accomplishment so far. After my high school, that is uh after my A levels class, I wanted to take up engineering and what better to uh to get into IETs. So I prepared one year and worked very hard and I took coaching for both eleventh and twelfth simultaneously and got into the IETs with an all India rank of ninety one out of <43.8> people.
