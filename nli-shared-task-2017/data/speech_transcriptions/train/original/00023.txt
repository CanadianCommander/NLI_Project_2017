In my opinion I prefer novels and poetry and I think this reading material is more interesting because it's different to magazines or literature you have to read in school or at university it creates more curiosity about knowledge. It gives you the ability to think beyond and um create pictures in your head and define targets you may reach <%> sometimes. This is why to sum up um I prefer novels than poetry.
