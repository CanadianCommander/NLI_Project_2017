I'm sure that one of the most important thing that I miss when I'm, I'm in another city or another country is the food of my mother. She's a very, very good cooker. And always she prepared something I like. And also my sister and her presence. Her capacity to, to make the things uh with uh, with joy and it's her personality. I, I miss her a lot. Her personality. And also the, the sounds of my house. The sounds of my house um can remember me my childhood and uh the most beautiful moments I've lived in my house. And mostly now I'm living in another uh city for stu- study.
