An interesting book that I have read it's called Down Under by Bill Bryson and it caught my attention because I was living in Australia by that time and this book abo- it is about the travel that Bill Bryson did to Australia and uh well, he basically descri-, describes the people over in Australia. He describes as well the means of <%20.5> transportation as he, he traveled from Sydney to Perth by train. He as well describes the customs and what is typically uh appropriate for people down under. He also goes to uh talk about animals and fauna and flora about that city and in country.
