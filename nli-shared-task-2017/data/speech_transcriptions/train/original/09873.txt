Uh when I'm away from them I really miss my family because I have live with them for the most longest time with anyone whoever I've lived. And they're the people who care for me the most and they um because they're family they take care about my health what I eat and what I do from away from the home. It uh they are the source of my life they give most to me. I think family is the most thing I miss.
