My favorite uh the most interesting book I have read is the book about the life of Martin Luther King which deals with his life. It's my best book because Martin Luther king was a very meaningful and important person for our society. It shows, additionally it shows how cruel a society can be nowadays. As a result you can say that everybody should read this book because it shows many aspects of our society and makes one conscious about the cruelties of our society.
