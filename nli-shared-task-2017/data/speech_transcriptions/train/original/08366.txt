My best uh, my best acco- accomplishment is that the passing the bar exam of the Korean law exam. The first thing I prepare this the attending the law school in Korea and I studied very hard the whole the aspect of the legal aspect of the Korean law. And then I passed the bar exam and then now I am a lawyer. Uh I think it is the  best acco- accomplishment I, I've ever had  in my life. I'm very proud of it. Okay, thank you.
