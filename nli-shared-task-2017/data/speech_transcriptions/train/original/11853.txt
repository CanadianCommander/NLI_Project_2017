I was in an opportunity to teach an Arabic language to an American students. Uh this opportunity was successful successful to me because I think that Americans need to learn about other uh culture and other uh countries. Uh this oppor- opportunity was important because uh the American students that I teach them in Arabic Arabic classes and language they thought that it was important and they learned a lot from me and I learned a lot from them about what they think about the Arabic and what I think about the Americans and that's why I uh I think that's a special opportunity.
