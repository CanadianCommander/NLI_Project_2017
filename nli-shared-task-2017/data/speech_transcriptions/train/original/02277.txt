I choose magazines on my reading material uh in my free time. I choose this because magazines would us information about the curre- current information going on in the world and it is interesting to know about the the people and the uh and things that they're doing around the world and also magazines would provide us about uh the current issues and also uh about uh uh the things going on around the world. It will be interesting to know this things in store for going for novels and other things. It would just for time pass. Magazines would go give us the uh knowledge and also with the uh with the general knowledge that we actually like, for interview etcetera.
