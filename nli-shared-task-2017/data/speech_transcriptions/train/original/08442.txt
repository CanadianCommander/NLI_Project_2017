Well uh my career that I want to study if I could, it it would be a business manager because a business manager could work in any place, in any kind or enterprise and she could do a lot of things, work with people, manage financial resources, material resources and also um the specific goals that a company may have, they um sometimes can can plan strategist toward for achieve their goals and I think that a business manager always always would be needed in an enterprise.
