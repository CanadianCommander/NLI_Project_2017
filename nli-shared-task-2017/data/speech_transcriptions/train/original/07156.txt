The main quality that I think that would make someone a valuable member of a team is the team participation. In any team or a group, if the team has to perform a- as a team then each and every person of the team should have this quality, that is team participation. If there is no proper team participation amongst the team members then the team cannot proceed progressively so uh team participation plays a major role in a team work group.
