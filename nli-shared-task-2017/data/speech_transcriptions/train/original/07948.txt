That's a tricky question actually, uh I would like so that I read a lot of history history books such as um Life of uh <%> people because I like to learn a lot about the lives I like to learn a lot about uh what they did and I can do that as long as it doesn't interfere with what I do at school. I would like to say that uh it's very nice to read that it's pretty relaxing I like to chill out and do a lot of things. And well I like to read magazines but the best thing I like to do just like when you are when you want to relax after after after you've done sport or stuff like that and the best thing you can ever do, ever do is just to read a history books, the books about history.
