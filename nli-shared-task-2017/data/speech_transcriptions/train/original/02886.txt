I would prefer uh reading uh reading magazines rather than uh novels and poetry because in magazines we can know water what it is happening all over the world. And right now in this technological world, in this modern world by sitting at home not knowing anything in the world it not possible to possible for us to explore ourself. So it is bet- it is the best way to know the world by reading the magazines and in magazines they are giving every each and every poe- every side of the each and every look and corners like it's giving the in formation of politics how technology is developing and um and we can know about the great personalities also. So I would prefer to read magazines.
