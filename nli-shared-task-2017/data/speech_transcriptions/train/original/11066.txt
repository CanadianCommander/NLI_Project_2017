So I miss my family a lot, also my especially my sisters, my little sisters who used to wake up me early and room because I have all my own things there and I also miss the TV because you know dorm I can't have my own TV and I also miss my friends because here I don't, I don't have them but I have to do new friends and I think I will do it.
