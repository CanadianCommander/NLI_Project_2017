I think that one of the most important opportunities life has given to me was to be able to work with people who have so much less than what we have. When I was around sixteen or seventeen years I started going to church and I joined a group and we did some mission travelling to the north west of the Argentina, of my country. And there we worked with poor people who lived in barracks who mostly don't go to school. Who believe in God but they have no health education, nor um legal education or go to school nor anything. And what we give them is so much less than what they give us that was so huge.
