If friends were coming to my country France I would definitely tell them to visit Paris. Paris is described as the city of light, the most beautiful city in the world for peo- for some people and well I would tell them to uh to go visit The Louvre, the very famous museum with all um artifacts from all over the world or to go visit the Eiffel Tower. But um I could tell them to go visit uh The Qu- Quai Branly Museum which has opened this year and which is retracing all the um primitive uh pieces of arts which uh which we have in the world.
