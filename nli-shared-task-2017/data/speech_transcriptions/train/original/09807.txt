A few years later I had this opportunity to visit the Serena in uh Geneva. Serena is the most important center uh for uh physical research uh um particles and uh little particles. And uh it was really amazing for me and uh it was a unique opportunity because uh only there I could uh assist to some experiments uh related to uh hydrogens and a lot of other atoms and particles. Uh and uh because of, of the importance of that center and uh, and that's all.
