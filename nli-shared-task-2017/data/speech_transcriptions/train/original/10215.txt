I believe that uh most important uh quality a team member should posses is the ability to be a good team player, to journey co- coherently with the group, so that there are much less conflicts in a group. Be, journeying together is not in just terms of work but also important to build a personal level relationship within the team. And uh a team feeling increase will directly affect the productivity of the work being done by the team. So it is important that each team member contributes to the team by playing a good team member.
