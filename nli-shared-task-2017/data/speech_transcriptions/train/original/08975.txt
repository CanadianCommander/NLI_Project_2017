An accomplishment that uh required me to work very hard was of course um the exam to enter the <%08.9> which is uh a school preparing for translation and interpretation. And it was perfectly difficult for me as I am from a Scientific background and as long as studies are concerned that and of course it is very important to me because I realized during my studies in Science that I wanted to change profession. So of course it was very important too.
