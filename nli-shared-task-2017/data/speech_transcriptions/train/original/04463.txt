When I'm away from uh my home what I miss the most is the food like uh my mom prepares it is one of a kind and it is really difficult to find it or to cook it myself. Another thing that I miss it is the love that surrounded in the house in the whole environment. Being a family of five plus my own wife and two kids there is a lot of it all day long and everyday. So that brings up a lot of comfort you know when you're by yourself and away from home it is difficult to find unless you know you can have some of your family members with you. And also the location, the house brings up good memories and helps a lot.
