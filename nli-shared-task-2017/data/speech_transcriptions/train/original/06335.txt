When I am away from my home what I miss the most is my intimacy and my privacy. It's uh the uh the ability to have my own stuff and use them whenever I want. Uh it's uh uh I miss being alone and doing what I want. Uh that's some stuff that you cannot do when you are away from your home. Uh I also miss uh um watching TV or listening to music I like. Uh choosing what I want to do.
