The most uh the most important thing that I miss about my family when I'm away uh from the home is that first I miss their love and affection that they can uh hold upon me when I am when I am  with them and also I miss my mama's food actually my mom prepares a very good food so I have I have more than what I can have. So I miss the food, I miss their love and affection, I miss their inspiration that they can give me when they are with me and also I miss the surroundings that they are my neighbors and my uh teachers and also this is way.
