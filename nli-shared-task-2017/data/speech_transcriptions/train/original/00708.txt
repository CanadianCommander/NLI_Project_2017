So when I'm away from home, the things I miss most are usually my relatives like my mother and my father and brothers and sisters, which uh I would love to see, uh and I'm quite used to see them uh every day. So there is only the al- also I'm in the, the fact that uh when you're home you feel safe. You're in the sort of environment you know very well, and this is also the thing that I miss uh a lot when I'm away. And there is most of all my dog that I really love to, to play with. And uh he is the one that I uh I miss maybe the most when I'm far away from my house.
