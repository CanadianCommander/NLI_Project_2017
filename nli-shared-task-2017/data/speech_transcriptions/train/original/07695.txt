When I'm away from my home the most uh precious thing that I mi- uh that I miss is my parents. The parents who has brought me so much uh, uh, has given me source of love and affection. And also the love and affection that they have uh given me throughout my life. At the same time uh I also miss the foods; the delicious foods that I used to have when uh at my home made by my parents. Uh at the same time uh the friends that I have spent a lot of time along with them playing here and there and uh doing notorious things. Um these are all the things are much more important and uh friends, foods and parents.
