When I little kid I use to read <%3.6>, it's written by Michael and uh and it is about a journey of a turtle who was making different es- experiences with different people and different things to handle and to cope with. And it's just about um, how to handle life and how to handle uh a lot of things that you have to go through. And it's about developing your own self esteem and to deal with life. And yeah, it was very interesting and I like to read it and I will like to read again.
