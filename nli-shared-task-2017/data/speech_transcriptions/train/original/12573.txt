Recently, I read Da Vinci Code. The story is difficult but the story is so <%> so it it interested for me. And I'm not Christian so at first I couldn't understand about the story but and after reading twice, I could understand and I wanted to go to Italy and I wanted to see church. So I wanted to know about Christian. That all.
