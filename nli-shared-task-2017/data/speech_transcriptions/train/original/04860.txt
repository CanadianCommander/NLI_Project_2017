If I would chose any career for me I would like to be an actress. I love acting, I've attended also a couple of uh courses to learn how to do it uh pretty well and uh so I'd like it to be my job. Um, uh first of all because uh for a couple of hours at least if you work in a theater you can be who ever you want for in the while and escape for your, from your uh everyday life. And then um actors usually answer, are earn a lot of money and so it's uh a good thing too I think they can travel all alon- all a round the world uh and they have success.
