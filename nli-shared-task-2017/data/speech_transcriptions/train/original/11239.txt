If friends were expected to visit my country I would suggest then to visit capital city that is New Delhi. I would like to take a look around my capital city because it speaks a lot about the history of the country. They get to see the museums the historical buildings in the city and they can learn lot about the country. Moreover the capital city is well developed so they won't have any problem uh spending the time in a different country. So I believe that uh taking them to a capital city will make them understand that about my country.
