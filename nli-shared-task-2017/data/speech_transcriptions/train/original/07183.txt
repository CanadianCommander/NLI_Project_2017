The special opportunity given was when I was doing my presentation in my major class. We had to do some presentation and it was my turn to do it, but the, and everybody was made of speakers except me, I was, I'm the only one was international student. And professor I think he kind of felt sorry for me so he set one questions. And as funny joke he told the class uh not to make any questions, and I think it was a special opportunity for me not having questions from classmates.
