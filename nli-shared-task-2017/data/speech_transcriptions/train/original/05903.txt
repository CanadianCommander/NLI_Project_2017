One of the biggest accomplishments I had is um when I was in my <%> university I was uh <%> school. And when I finished that third year I went on just to <%> more and more about the unprecedented rates. When I just graduated I went to do a surgery <%> I sat with my whole patient and that was the age of twenty one years old. Although that time it was very <%> because uh well at teh age of twenty one uh basically know what they <%> that way. Uh it took me a lot of uh time to prepare for that until my <%> but then I really like what I have done.
