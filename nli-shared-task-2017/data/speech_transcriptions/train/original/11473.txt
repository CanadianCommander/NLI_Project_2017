Well um I am the opinion when you are working in a big team for a project it is very important that you have a person who have a quality that uh to lead. And the first thing why I prefer this quality is that the self confident person can help you in making some decisi- decisions you can confer with him, if you have problems in your project then he can help you. And another thing is if you have someone who leads, um you have somebody who can manage the whole project, and it isn't so confused like when nobody was there who has the quality to lead. Yeah that is it.
