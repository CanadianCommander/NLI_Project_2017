The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the decision actually to go abroad because I was always scared of uh people I don't know and different country with different, with a different culture. So was really hard to fit in there to um get to know new people, to feel safe and feel home with the family I was living with and all that stuff. I mean it was important to me because I wanted to be um the best for my parents and I wanted to be a little more grown up and I wanted to do my own things. I didn't want to be um like a child anymore so.
