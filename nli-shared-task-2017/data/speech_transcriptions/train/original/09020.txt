Uh the most interesting book what I read is uh Pinocchio. The first reason is that the Pinocchio actually a doll and he he overcame to be a person he was to be a person and he tried again and again. Second reason is that, the old old man take care of doll to make a person and gives a lesson to work hard and be focused on my dream.
