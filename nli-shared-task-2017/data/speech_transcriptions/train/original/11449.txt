When I am away uh the most important thing that I miss are my relatives, because I have very close relationship to my mother and my sister. And also I miss my friends because they are quite important in my life. Um in addition I miss the possibilities of my hometown, for example to go away, I miss the theaters that I am used to in Berlin, I miss the bars uh that I usually visit friends when we go to- go out. Um yes I also miss my favorite sports club, because I'm a fan of a football team that's located in Berlin, and when I'm away I ca- I cannot go to their matches at our stadium.
