If I have to invite my friends to visit a place in my country, I would I have to visit my uh na- my place that is Hyderabad where I live. Because Hyderabad is uh the a developing city now. It has both historical important and and developing aspect also. Um it is famous for it's food uh culture and also historical monuments like  Golconda Fort and uh Charminar which are worth to see. Apart from this I can have a chance of taking them to my place where they can understand the culture the living habits of people apart from the the geology of my place.
