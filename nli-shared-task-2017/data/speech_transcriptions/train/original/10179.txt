I live in <%> so uh is uh uh small country visit, it's north part of Italy. So if uh friends come to visit me, I think I suggest him to visit the biggest city along <%> that is Venice that is a very famous city uh also very very beauty city. Uh also Treviso that is uh not so famous but is very very nice is uh famous for the wine because around Treviso there is a lot of field, a lot of farmers that produce wine. The wine that is called Prosecco that is very nice is quite like champagne but I think is better than champagne. Uh also we can see the country around.
