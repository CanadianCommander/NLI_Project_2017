I had the opportunity of studying Dr Roy and his research group at <%7.0> university non electr- non electronic research laboratory last summer. And this was a great opportunity for me. First of all I had the opportunity of studying with PHD students at work and I'm aiming to study a PHD. I'm aiming to de- to have a degree on PHD so that was a great thing to see them at work. Also it, it provided a vast economic background on various engineering skills and a good deal of software skills with by the help of the aid from this uh the PHD student. So it was all the more a great experience to be able to study with Dr Roy as an intern in his laboratory.
