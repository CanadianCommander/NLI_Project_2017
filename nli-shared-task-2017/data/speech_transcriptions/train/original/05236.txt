One very interesting book I have recently read is Women That Run With Wolves <%> Pinkola Estes. It was very interesting because it describes different aspects of women life uh by telling different stories and tales. For example, when talking bout Blue Bird which is one story, she explains the relationship of women with men. And another story she speaks about uh relationship between woman and his mo- and her mother and so on. So uh it deals with different aspects of a woman life and consciousness um.
