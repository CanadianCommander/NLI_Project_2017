The quality which I think makes someone valuable someone a valuable member of a team is uh cooperation. Why I think it is an important quality for a team or group member to have is without cooperation, we cannot do anything. For example if you take any uh se- set the game, uh without the cooperation between the two players, they can't get they can't play the game well. Uh if one one is not cooperating with uh other uh they make mistakes and they may lose points and uh finally they may lose the game. Not only in the a game, whatever the thing we take whether it's maybe a software company or it maybe an um <%> producing without the cooperation of of one another uh or one cannot do anything. So I think uh uh the coop- cooperation quality it must be there.
