The most I miss when I'm away from home is my mum 'cause my mum has always been with me since I was born, pampering me, giving me the best things in life. And also I, I really miss my mum because she cooks the best, best, best, best food for me and I miss my mum because she really loves me a lot and I really love her and I always want to be under her care and love and most of all I miss my mum's food because she's the best cook in the world.
