When I'm away from my home I always miss about a time less our family can get dinner together. Because in the process on my, of my courses my family always get dinner together on Saturday night and at Sunday nine. In less, in weekend we can talk about how when did in the past one week and uh what we will do in the future week. So when I live of my home I always think about a time less we can get to dinner together. Even though when I studying or work in Taipen city but is not at home I always think about the times best at home and staying around with my family.
