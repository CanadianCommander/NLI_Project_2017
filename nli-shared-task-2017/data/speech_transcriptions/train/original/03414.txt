I got a nice little <%> that I always miss when I'm not at home, um she is about four years old and she's very fluffy and very sweet and um I'm also miss my bath and when I'm not at home because I think like the old shower is the most important thing to have. I miss my bed, especially I miss my friends as well but they visit me very often so it's not that hard, um I also what doing this is also miss going out to Frankfurt because it's a very nice big city and there are a lot of very good clubs that I like a lot and basically that's it what I'm missing the most.
