The quality that I think makes someone a valuable member of a team is hard-working. The thing that as long as people work hard, there's nothing that they can't do. And if they work hard, it's going to be beneficial for the team or group member, because the work that they're going to share or the project they're going to do is going to be shared and is going to be cleared and it's going to be considered, definitely it's going to be done on a time. If the person is not hard-working, then it's so difficult to trust someone. That's why I believe that the most important quality is hard-working.
