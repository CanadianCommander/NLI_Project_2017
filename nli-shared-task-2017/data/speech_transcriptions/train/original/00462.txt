If I could any job or I career I want, I would like to be a professional pianist, because I been to school which is music, conservatory force more than seven years. And I am professionally trained to be a pianist, and I have a lot of experience with performing, and also I have a lot of knowledge of the music history, theory, background of the music and composers. So I really think I have ability to be a pro- professional pianist and maybe I could teach a little bit for the student, because I would like to share my knowledge of music to young people. I love to write music.
