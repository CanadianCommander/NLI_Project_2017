Away from my family uh for my university education and then if other if other part of my uh business. Uh I miss my family most. My uh time spending with them speaking, having dinners together, sharing the quality time with my parents, my sisters. The uh environment in my home feels like I'm secure and somebody else is caring for me and I do not have to think about anything else in the world. I'm just the happiest kid on earth at that point on time. I miss them and the most important thing is the family. I realize it when I go home for holidays or vacations.
