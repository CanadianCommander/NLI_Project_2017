If friends of mine from other countries um were going to visit me in my home country Germany, I would suggest them to first um visit our main city in Berlin because um I think this is uh a really interesting um city with a variety of museums or um special places. And in addition um there you can see uh parts of the wall who once uh divided eastern and western Germany which uh I think is really important fact uh getting to know from Germany. And other place uh I would um bring them.
