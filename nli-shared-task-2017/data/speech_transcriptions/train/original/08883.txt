I would take them to Berlin cause Berlin is the capital of Germany and you also can see uh where east and where the Germany was separated and the East and West Germany but uh, East and West Europe. And it's also the biggest city of Germany and you can see many think only white people live Germany, but can you really that there is a multi culture in in Germany especially in big cities such as Berlin and also there are a lot of sites uh for example <%> and yeah got nice restaurants there, it's just nice. I went there, we had a good time there. So I really would take my other that's another kind of state too.
