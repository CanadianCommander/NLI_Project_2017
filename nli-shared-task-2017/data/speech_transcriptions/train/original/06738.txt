Uh I guess the interesting book I have recently read uh is uh is a classic called Sons and Lovers written by uh uh Lawrence, D. H. Lawrence. I think this book is interesting cause it uh pose a question about Oedipus Complex, about uh a sense, attachment to his mother which he has, uh which he's never had before. Oedipus Complex which is a very uh noble idea about uh, uh although this has happened before uh in our life but I have never seen it being told in a story. Uh it's about, it's about uh uh uh hi- a mother and his several sons gradually growing up and cannot, uh cannot, cannot get rid of her.
