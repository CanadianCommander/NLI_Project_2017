I'd prefer to read magazines I don't really like novels and nor poetry. Yeah I prefer to read about my career mechanical engineering I love machines. Uh I love cars engine uh those are basically the reasons I like <%> that kind of reading. Some times novel could be boring uh and you can predict what's going to happen that's maybe because I haven't found a real um a good novel or or or or or good poetry to read to read too.
