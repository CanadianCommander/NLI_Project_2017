Well the most, the most important opportunity that I have had in my life was a uh a trip in Mexico city, that my law firm uh gave me to improve my uh, my English and in particular uh to improve my conscience and experience in legal file. Well I'm a lawyer and I practice with business law.S so see what happen in another country different in mine, with another kind of legal system is important for me, and for my career. So that is for it.
