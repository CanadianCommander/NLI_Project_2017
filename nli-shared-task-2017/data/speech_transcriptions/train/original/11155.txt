I think the special opportunity that came for me is to come United States and study. Uh because I think the English is kind of getting really important in this world. And uh my parents gave me this opportunity, opportunity to came here and study for English. So I think it will really help me for the future to get a job or work so I have more you know special or more technical things than other people. I think this special opportunity is really important for me and I really thank my parents to give me this chance.
