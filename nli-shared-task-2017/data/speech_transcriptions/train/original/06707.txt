The accomplishment where I had to work very hard was to go to in my non native language, to go to study in a university in Flemish. Um I did this because um I thought it was very important for me to know my country and my country has two two national languages and so going to study in the other language was for me the best way to to know the other part of the country and also it's um it was very important to learn this language to further to later find find a good a job. So um but this required of course really a lot of work because when I get in and at the university, I didn't really know very well uh Flemish which is uh actually Dutch, the Dutch language.
