One year ago I had the opportunity to, to do a semester abroad in Spain uh in the city of Madrid. Uh there I was able to improve and develop my uh language skills uh on the one hand my Spanish skills and in speaking Spanish and on the other hand uh improving my English knowledge and s- uh s- skills and speaking and reading English because I also had uh some lectures in English and na- English native speakers from United States. So I think it might help, be helpful for my ne- following career to speak English very well.
