My most important as is the most valued accomplishment was getting through the entrance examination of my engineering college. The reason is simply that my college happens to be the best engineering college that my country has to offer and it is ranked among the top engineering institutes of the world. The entrance exam is also considered the toughest exam to crack in the world. I had to go through a lot of personal sacrifices, a lot of hard work for the task and as they say the taste of success is sweet so it was very, very enthralling when I got to the examination.
