When I'm away I will miss my grandmother most uh because she is one that raises me up and I have a deep emotional relationship to her. And uh meanwhile I due to that I spend my childhood with her, she is one that understands me the most. So I can share everything with her. Um for example uh I would tell her um the guy who uh I'm re- recently hanging out with and uh her how's my performance um at school. Um so she's always the one that I miss the most when I'm away from home.
