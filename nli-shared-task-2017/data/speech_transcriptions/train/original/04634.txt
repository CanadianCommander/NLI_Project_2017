In tenth grade in my school we uh had to make a choice where we want to spend one week for uh a practical skill um to uh do a job in, in a company or where yeah, where we would like to do and yeah, I was offered the opportunity to do it uh with a lawyer, a really good lawyer uh and I was really happy about that because this would uh be a good uh thing in my resume, it would uh improve it and it will also improve my knowledge about how um a big company like this one uh works.
