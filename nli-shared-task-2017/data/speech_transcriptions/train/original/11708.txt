I do prefer to read novels in my leisure time because uh uh by reading novels, we can get um many <%> ideas, but as a reading magazines and poetry this are also uh giv- uh some information, but the poetry mainly emphasizes about the uh uh I mean uh rhythmic thinking on those things, but when you read all the novels, we can uh look at the situations. I mean in the real time written by uh novelist and uh I think uh probably with the novel we can also get into the uh situation where we can understand the uh capabilities of a person and uh understand the uh culture of a people and all these things. That's that's.
