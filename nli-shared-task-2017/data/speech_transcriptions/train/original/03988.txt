A special opportunity that I was given is learning English in America learning English in America is my dream. Since I was thirteen or fourteen years old I really desired to learn English, but you know, in my country South Ko- South Korea, learn teaches only grammar not speaking or some useful English can I s- I can speak. So this is my really special opportunity being here and learning English in here so I really love this opportunity and I want to be a good English speaker to take this special opportunity.
