There are few things that I <%> not at home. Um the most important of is certainly my family. I miss my parents and my sister because they're just the people I love my and then I miss our house and the garden. And uh I do also miss our dog because um I can do long long with walks with him and I don't have that opportunity in Munich. And um yes, I'm from <%> and I miss the city itself because it's just beautiful and provides you with um with lot of uh opportunities to go out or to go to museums and everything. I went, I forgot and most of all I usually miss my friends and because I don't have that many in the city I'm living now and oh yeah, that's that's what I miss.
