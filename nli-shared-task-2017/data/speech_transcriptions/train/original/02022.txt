If the one place I have to uh, that I have to show my friend then I, then I will choose my native place uh that is Udairpur. It is located in the central part of India. And since uh I'm, I'm a local from there so I can, uh I can um, uh help my friends to see its different places. So my uh place contains many old foods. Wit- uh with the ancient history. So I think uh it will definitely fascinate my, my friend to know about old facts. Some forts are around two thousand years old. Then also Udairpur has very ancient culture. It also has very scenic and serene climate. So I think my friend will enjoy this ti- uh his time.
