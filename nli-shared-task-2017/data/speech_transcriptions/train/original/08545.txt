If a friend from another country was going to spend time in my country here in Germany. First of all I would visit with him uh Dusseldorf and we could go shopping and um see the rain and all the nice buildings. But I would suggest to visit Munich as well and when it is hot and we could go the Oktoberfest. And another city whic- which is very important is as well Berlin the capital where we could see many important historic sites as well. And I think that that would be a very nice stay for my friend here in Germany.
