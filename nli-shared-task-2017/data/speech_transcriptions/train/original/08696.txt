I like to read novels in my free time because I think that they have uh <%> of of topics and I could rela- people get relax about that. And the magazine are something special articles and I I don't like it, I thought that are <%>. And the poetry is other other kind of lectures that I prefer reading when I'm in a beach or when I am tired but not in my free time <%>. The novels uh there are a lot of authors.
