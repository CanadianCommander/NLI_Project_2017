The book that I really enjoy and I recently read, it's a book named Paula uh and it's written by uh an author from Chile. I really enjoyed. It's uh it's a story about the life of a girl and it describes what she used to do as a girl and how the politics in the country used to affect her family and it also reflects and tells you the story of all of her sisters, her cousins and it's a very interesting story because it's a family full of women, um the power this women has and they have uh how they work together and how they are influenced <%> by the political movement of the at the time. And I really enjoyed because it was full of information.
