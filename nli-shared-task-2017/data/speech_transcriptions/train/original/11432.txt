In my free time I like to read uh novels. Those may include uh books which are fiction. I'm interested in fiction because of these deals with a great variety of topics and it gives us a great insight on what the author thinks. The thinking of the author is the most important thing, what the author is trying to convey. What I enjoy about this is a great plot uh which conveys to us a significant meaning. In fiction there could just be topics that could be dealt upon. This could include real life situations.
