One of the most interesting books I have ever read is uh the book about the life of Patino which is a very important uh man in the history of Bolivia. He was a star-, he started like a miner in the minors of I think Oruro <%19.7> and then he became one of the most rich people in the world. He almost uh got to be just like uh the second richest uh person richer in, in the world. I think he is one of the better examples how people can grow from being uh poor people to become successful.
