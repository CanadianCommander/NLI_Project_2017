If my friends came from another country I think I will let them I will make them go to Vancouver and uh make them go to the Stanley Park, the quarry and then make <%> see all the marine animals and also go around the Stanley Park. Even though the storm crushed down lots of the trees, I think Stanley park is one of the most beautiful parks in the world and where I live they don't have that much um nature. So I want them to look around the forest and see all the birds and smell this fresh air.
