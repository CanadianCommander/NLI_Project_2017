I enjoy reading many kind of novels. I prefer science, fiction novels or as well any kind of uh such as um I like reading Hemingway and I like reading Kera, they are great uh writers in the American culture. I also like reading political magazines because they explain the world and what is happening right now although some might be biased but one has to adjust to the kind of reading material one wants to read. And um I also like reading magazines but some of them are not very informative. Especially women magazines or and that's it.
