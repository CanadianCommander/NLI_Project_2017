The thing that I always miss when I am out of home is my family. For example I work like a flight attendant in an airline and I usually have to stay away from my house for several days and in the days I miss a lot my little brother, my father and for example the way that my mother cooks to me. I also miss the comfor-, my comfortable bedroom. I used to sleep always in hotel bedroom, bedrooms and they are so cold for me. I miss the familiar ambient and furthermore I think I cannot get a good sleep.
