The most interesting book which I have is The Godfather written by Mario Puzo. The story revolves around a man who's from a stage of a laborer to that of a mafia leader. The story portrays the criminal activities and the underground activities like smuggling, drugging and game business. The main theme is punishing of bad people. The Godfather in the story is portrayed as a man of vision who plans a lot for his children and grandchildren so that they live in a criminal free country and have better lives than the lives which they have lead. And also it shows the deception of people and the way people interpret others. So it's the most interesting book which I have read.
