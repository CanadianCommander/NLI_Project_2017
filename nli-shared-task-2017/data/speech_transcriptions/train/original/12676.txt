If I had a friend that would come to France, I would suggest them to go to Paris because that is the most important city in the, um in this country and it is also wonderful city. Many tourists go there during, coming from the whole world and this um at all times of the year. So I guess Paris is really, is a really wonderful city um during spring because you can there go on boats where you could uh visit the city um uh where you can see all the good monuments like the <%36.6>, Notre Dame, the Louvre. There are really a lots of different archi- architecture in the city um which represents older the times um so.
