Well I consider that a special opportunity that has been given to me was a soccer opportunity that the coach gave me on my school. I consider this opportunity very important because it helped me demonstrate my abilities on soccer, made me gain eighth place on the actual soccer team to play against other schools or universities. And it also helped me because, make me feel capable of achieving my goals. It showed me a way of practicing soccer and it helped me to apply for a scholarship on universities. I consider it was very important.
