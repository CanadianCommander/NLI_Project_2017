What I most miss is the my Mom's meal. Um when I go out and go out of the home then I have to uh buy some foods to eat, but that's not familiar to me so I miss my mom's meal. And another thing is uh TV. Um TV in my home I can get the information and the interesting things from the TV by seeing them, by seeing it. And that's what, that's the things that I miss most.
