When I'm away from home uh the thing that I miss most is my room because I find it very convenient to live in my ro- in my room I have computer, I have nook and TV set and CD and when I wan- want to listen to music I'll pick my CD from my bookshelf. And when I want to read I'll do the same thing. And uh with my computer and I can get online and talk to my friends and brow- browse the internet and do all sorts of things. And uh they are placed in a very convenient place that I can reach each of them without walking so much. So, so that's what I miss most when I live my hometown, my room.
