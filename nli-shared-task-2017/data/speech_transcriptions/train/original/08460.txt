The thing I will miss most when I study abroad uh or since in US will be the food that my mom cook. Because um my mother cooks for me everyday since young and this is the first time I will be staying away from her so I'll miss the food that she cook and family food. Maybe it will make me feel s- not comfortable because I will have to eat outside everyday since I don't know how to cook. And now I'll miss my family members also, especially my younger brother we're very close. We always stay together and then have fun. I find it difficult when I I'm going to study abroad and not having the support from him and to.
