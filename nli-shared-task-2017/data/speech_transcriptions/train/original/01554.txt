Um I would take my friends to Zürich, I think because uh first of all, I know the city quite good so I can show them a lot of things like museums and nice places. Another reason is there are a lot of parties in Zürich so we can go out in the evening and it would be quite nice to learn some specific people etcetera. Um as a third reason, there is the lakes so when it's summertime we can just chill out and go for a walk there. Um yeah, Switzerland it's like the capital of um, Zürich sorry it's like the capital of Switzerland so all in all I would take my friends from a foreign country to visit this city. It's really nice city.
