I have been blessed with a great family. Therefore whenever I'm away from my home I always miss my family. All the family get together and the gatherings are something that I look really forward to throughout the year for example as we get together on functions and many other things so this is something that I would really miss. Secondly I really, I would really miss my friends. I have, I have been living in this place since I was born and I have some really good friends here who have been with me through thick and thin so I would really miss them. And finally I love my country, I love the place where I live in so if I go away from here I would really miss the environment and everything around here. The ambiance especially.
