Whenever I'm away uh the things I miss the most are probably good food, um my family because I'm al- always very attached to them. Uh TV and I love watching the sitcom so not getting to <%> watching the TV <%>. Um I guess my neighbors because I have been living in this area for a while now and uh with kind uh kind of a very close-knit community and uh so every, all my neighbors are like brothers and sisters. so I mean every time we move out or anything happens to anybody we're all there. so, that is one thing I really miss about home. And then generally just the neem tree in front of my house, the birds uh which I love to photograph and have been doing since childhood. I love my home because of that.
