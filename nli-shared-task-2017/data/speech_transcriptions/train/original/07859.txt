When I'm away my from my home I feel very homesick. There are two reasons behind that and there are very much important because first of all my parents, I really miss them a lot. When I'm away from my home I really miss the love and care the much of which my mother is pouring over on me. And secondly the meals she's, which she is cooking for me and then  the comfort uh I'm having at home is not away from the home. So I really miss my home a lot whenever I'm away and that's it.
