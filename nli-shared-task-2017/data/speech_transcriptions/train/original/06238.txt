There are two things that I miss most about my home when I'm away. Um the first thing is that uh my room with my best comfortable bed. Because uh you know when I'm away from my home I really need, uh when I feel like I need to be comfortable with the place I am now. Where that if I'm not in my room or I'm not in my room, I become really discomfortable and I really miss my room with my comfortable bed. And the second thing is that my mom's food which is really good.
