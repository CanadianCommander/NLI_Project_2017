I like reading books that approach teaching strategies because I can apply those strategies when I go to my school and I am with my students. Uh by reading this kind of books I can grow as a person, as a professional and I can know. Um these teaching books can help me improve my abilities as a teacher and they teach me new methodologies and new strategies to approach my students, parents and different.
