Uh the book that I've the most recently is The Dancing Wu Li Masters. Now that's a fairly funny name for a book. Um the book it basically describes some things about physics and quantum theory uh but unlike a textbook um it doesn't give, uh how should I say too much detail that it describes them in a different manner, uh a way that everyone uh who is not an engineer can understand. Um wh- what else can I, well it's a nice book and I highly recommend it um.
