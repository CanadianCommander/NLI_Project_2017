Um I would like to suggest to my friend to go to Tokyo, I have some reasons for this. First of all Tokyo is a modern city in Japan and it's a capital city in Japan. Therefore uh the friends can see the modern aspect of Japan. And if they come into Tokyo, have still have the old traditional and the cultural aspect. For instance if people go to  Asakusa people can see kabuki or kimono show. And lastly there are a lot of events in Tokyo, there therefore the friends cannot be tired of livi- staying at Tokyo. And if I have some suggestion.
