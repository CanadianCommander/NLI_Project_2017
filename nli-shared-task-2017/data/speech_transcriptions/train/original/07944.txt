One of the <%> accomplishment if may was when I went to take board in the basketball team. It was very hard because I knew I needed a lot of hard work. Um I wasn't very used to putting in too much effort or wo- working very hard but once I had put my I set my mind on it, I knew that I had to really work hard for it and this really helped me to grow as a person. It helped me understand that in life you have to put in a lot of hard work to get what you want to do or to become what you want to become. And therefore well of course in the end I ended up getting into the basketball team. Also realized that without hard work you won't reach anywhere in life and that's why I knew that I had to put in hard work and from then on, I made it a point, whatever I do I'll do it with my full heart and I'll put in my hard work.
