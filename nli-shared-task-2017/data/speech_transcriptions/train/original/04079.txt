Well, the book I'm interest is Oliver Twist. I like this book for three reasons. The first reason I like this book is the charact-. The cha-, charact- in this book is very lively. She's thoughtful and about the boy uh you can sue, uh really person person in the England that's, at that time. Thirdly, this book is very meaningful. It is the point out the scary and darkness in that society and allowed people to thought a lot of things. And finally, I like this, this book because of of his writing and the uh words in this book is very interesting.
