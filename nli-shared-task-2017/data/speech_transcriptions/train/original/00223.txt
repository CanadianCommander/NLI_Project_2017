If I had to show something to people coming from another country in France I would like to show them Paris because I think that uh it gives uh a good idea of the way French people live and behave. For instance, I'd like to take them to concert places and you know that that they can understand how we young people just live in France. And I'd like to make them taste restaurants and maybe make them see Eiffel Tower. And actually I'm found of Paris and I like to make them share my love of this town and I think that it will represents a good in a good way Par- Paris French.
