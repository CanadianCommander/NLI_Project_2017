As I've been going uh with for a lot of summers, I know uh what is to feel homesick when you go away but I really most miss uh when I go far away from home is uh of course my family, my mom and my dad and also my friends uh for example uh this summer I went to Washington and what I realized is that I can't live uh without my family but uh neither without mu family nor uh without it's Spanish food, I really missed it. What I really realized too is that Americans don't really like doing sports and I miss Spanish people who like being fit and doing sports.
