Uh people working in a team uh have to accept uh the quality uh of other people and what other people want they uh have to be uh open minded and to know how to communicate with all the people and accept the ideas of other people. For example in a uh uh in order to uh to find the best ideas to achieve the best goals for the for the group and the team.
