An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was during my training period at Air India in the engineering course. That assignment was regarding a project about a aircraft equipment that needed to be tested and so they had to prepare a test bench for the same. It was very important that I prepare a proper test bench in order to remove the calibration requirement of the equipment and it was a responsible job on my part to do so so that I could get what, what uh being done.
