I really enjoy reading during my free time the um British Magazine, The Economist. I really like to read it because uh there are a lot of news from everywhere in the world and it also summarize, summarizes all the main events uh of the last week. I I really like all the sections especially the sections that uh talk about my country Italy. I also like the sections about the US, it's really good to read it because you can have an overview of all the main events. I also read obituaries at the end of the magazine.
