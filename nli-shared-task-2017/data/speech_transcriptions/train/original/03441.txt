Uh an interesting book which I have recently is The Alchemist, it is uh a book which is very very inspiring. It inspired me to change my attitude towards life. In this book the author mentions that one should follow the general uh instructions given to us are the general things which happens at us and we should follow unto them and we should give careful attention to it and plan out our things accordingly because God gives us some ideas, some uh some things to follow and we should we should learn how  to identify them.
