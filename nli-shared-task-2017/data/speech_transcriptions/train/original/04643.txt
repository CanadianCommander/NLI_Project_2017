The last book I rode was the Diary of a German. The title reflects uh a little bit about what, what this book is about. The main theme is the Second uh World War uh period where these uh we see the main character of this book is talking about his uh life situation during this period. This is really interesting uh plus it gives you a different perspective of how you can look at this period of, of history. Gives uh perspective from inside, the one, that one perspective that we've never seen before.
