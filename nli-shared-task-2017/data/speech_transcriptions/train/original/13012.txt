I mean the mountains and I I could go with him and also most of all, I think that this is where you can get the most wonderful use on the land scape. I mean on the <%> and also because I that mountains is place where you can really rest. Um in comparison to the cities, it's not a place where you rest, but the mountains are definitely place when you can where you can relax and have a good time.
