To me very important accomplishment was when I went to uh when I learned swimming. Um usually you learn that when you're in elementary school. As a kid however, I didn't learn it and I mean life was fine not knowing how to swim but um I finally decided to learn it when I was twenty one and then for me it was very hard because um well you see kids do it and you're standing in the water and you actually cannot do it. Um so it took me a lot of time to learn a lot of um you know, hard work and hard practice but eventually I managed and now I can say I'm able to swim.
