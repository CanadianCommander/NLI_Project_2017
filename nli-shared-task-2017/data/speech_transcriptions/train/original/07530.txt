The Da Vinci Code is one of the best I have ever ever read because Dan Brown was, illustrated the story very well inside your eyes. So you can imagine like uh you are there, you can feel like that. And uh it's too cozy story that you can understand and uh take attention. Uh you can read the that that book at one breath.
