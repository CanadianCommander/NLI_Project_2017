The  accomplishment I had to work very hard was uh to go to Germany for uh graduate study and uh to live there and uh to study there. Uh it was in fact uh hard decision for me uh to go to uh, to Germany uh while I had to leave my family here in <%19.1> and I'm to leave uh in Germany alone and I have no one uh there and uh I had to stand on my own feet. And also it was uh difficult to study there uh because uh the course uh very, was very hard and uh I had to adopt to the course there and the people and the school and the, the new life there. So uh but I accomplish  it.
