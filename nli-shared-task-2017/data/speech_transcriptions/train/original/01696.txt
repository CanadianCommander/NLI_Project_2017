Uh what I miss the most when far away from home I would say it is um above all my family because I love my family very much and I would miss um to have them around and so when you have problem problems in um in another country uh you can just, you can call them but they aren't around to to discuss the problem you have with you and um yeah I want them just to be around. And um second of that is that I would miss my friends because I'm just going away with them at the weekends and um yeah well just to hang around with them. I would miss that very much familiar things.
