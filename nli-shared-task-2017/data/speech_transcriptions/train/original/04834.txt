I think I have worked really to gain my basic wind surfing certificate. Well it was about two or three years ago. I used to be quite an indoor girl and I don't always go out for sports but one day I just realized maybe I need moving. So I applied for the wind surfing course. It was a physically demanding training and of course it was hard for a weak girl like me but then I persist and I decided that I should never give up. So well I went on this course on a rainy and windy day which was good for wind surfing but I perverse for it and finally I gained the certificate which was a great accomplishment.
