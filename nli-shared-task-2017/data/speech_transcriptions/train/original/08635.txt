I think the quality makes someone a valuable member of a team is the sense of responsibility. In a group in a, in a team the most important thing is everyone cooperate together to, to achieve a, a, a common goal. And it's important for everyone to come to their own strengths to achieve the common goal. I remember when I was in the team I always appreciated the person who always showed punctuality, who always finish his work on time and this kind of responsibility can make the team work more efficiently and make the relationship between team members healthily.
