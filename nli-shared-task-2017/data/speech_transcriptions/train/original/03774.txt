A very important quality um for a team member is tolerance. Um tolerance means that somebody is able to listen to other people's opinions um that you're able to compromise and and to accept other people's ideas. Um that you're also able um to um be a member of the group fully and not be egotistic and uh always want to put your own ideas forward um in front of everybody else. Therefore I think tolerance is one of the most key important features um of a team member and everybody uh in group should try to be as tolerant as possible towards the others.
