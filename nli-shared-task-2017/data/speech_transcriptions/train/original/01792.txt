Yeah if friends from other country would like to spend time in my country, I would suggest the place of Hyderabad in India which is the capital city of Andhra Pradesh. I suggest this city because uh of the infrastructure and the type of transportation used there. The type of businesses which are there the type of people existing there, the type of languages being used and lot more. Um it consists of long about two million population with more uh one <%36.9> of businesses running over there. And the type of infrastructure developing right now.
