Main thing team member should have many qualities and as such you should be capable of understanding each and every person that is present. They should also have some leadership qualities, even though he's not he should be capable of uh having those leadership qualities. He should be easy going he should be loved by all and I believe he should be there like a pillar like a ball supporting each and every person of the team member in the times of sorrows whereas in the time of happiness. Because not only in the times of sorrow but in the hap- not only in the time of happiness but in the sorrow. A person requires another member whom he can share his thoughts with and only at that time I believe that valuable member would strike a goal would strike an important post in him that is the other member coming out.
