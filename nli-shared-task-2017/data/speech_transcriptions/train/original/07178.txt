The interesting book which I had read is Cain and Abel by Geoffrey Archer. Well the character in Cain fascinates me the most. It describes about the life lived by Cain and Abel both of the characters. particularly I was fascinated by the life of Abel who was a poor child, he has spend his life in Portuguese and then later on he got into America and how he had passed up his life through America. He has build up a hotel which was rated as five start hotel in New York. This learned about <%> Abel character, uh Cain was also a good competitor on the other hand.
