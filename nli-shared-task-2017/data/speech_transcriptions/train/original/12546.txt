Well if I have friends that are coming from another country, I would first of all um take them to Machu Picchu to Cusco city that is like the main first place in in Peru. It has old history and it combines Incas and European um ac- architecture. You can see a combination of the whole history of Peru. I think Machu Picchu is the best place to go because you can show history of old and new, it's modern and it's cool for everyone.
