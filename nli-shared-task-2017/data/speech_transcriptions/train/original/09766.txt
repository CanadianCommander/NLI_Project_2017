When I'm away from home the um the um things that I miss most are mainly my family and my friends. even though I'm always in touch with them with the Internet, with Skype or emails. I also miss my dog of course because uh traveling abroad, I can't take my dog with me. I miss the food, Italian food and and wines and um most of the time, I also miss uh my car, because I don't always have money to buy or to rent a car. So I have to use public transportation.
