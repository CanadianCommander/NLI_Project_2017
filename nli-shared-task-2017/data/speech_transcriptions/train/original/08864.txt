When I am abroad, the most thing that I most miss is the food because uh in Spain, the food is very good. Uh we have uh a lot of different uh uh meat and vegetables and fish, fresh fish and usually when you are in other country, the the way you cook and the quality of the food is very different. Uh maybe you cannot find the same thing that you like. And of course the the food, when it's cooked by your mother, is always the best food. Um the the food uh that you cook is not as good as your mother's food. And <%> with you.
