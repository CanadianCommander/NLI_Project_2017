Well, when I was uh at the age to do my Obligatory Civil Service in Germany, I decided to not do it in Germany but in France. So I had to so I had to learn France French. Um this is a very beautiful language I like it very much and I I love to to learn uh I took French lessons at school but uh they really didn't prepare me very well to speaking to French, actual French people in France who would speak very rapidly and uh don't uh don't uh wait very much in speaking. So as you are listening them <%> understanding them. So I had to work very very hard to uh achieve learning the French language but uh well, I'm very happy about that.
