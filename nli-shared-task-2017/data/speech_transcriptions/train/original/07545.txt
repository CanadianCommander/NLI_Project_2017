My country India is known for its vibrant culture, different cultures relating people and I would definitely want my friends to experience all the cultures in India, different festivals celebrated in India and I would like to uh them to have a whole a tour of India and would first take them to places where I visit, have already visited. As uh I was born in Kerala I would first take them to my hometown. Kerala has got known as gods own country. The most beautiful.
