The uh, the interesting book which I was read was on Unix. Uh it was very interesting because uh it contained the details about the new operating system called Unix and not only contains the details of the Unix operating system, it has several commands to know to the user and several short programming language and circuit programming. With the help of this we can know all about the, just about the Unix and uh this will make a rea-, a real advantage to me as I was completed my engineering I, I was at uh, eying for a job so they asked, the, the interviewer ask uh about the Unix questions so this book made me to get uh help of the <%43.2> questions so that's it for me and <%45.3>.
