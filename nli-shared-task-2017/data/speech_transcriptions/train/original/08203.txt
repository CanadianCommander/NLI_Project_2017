I like reading magazines in my free time. I prefer magazines because they are a bunch of sho- short stories in them and not just one long story. There are also some pictures in magazines which makes it which make it easier to understand the content. The articles in magazines are also about up to-date topics rather than stories from long time ago. And <%> fix it I'm studying Computer Science I'm interested in what is actually going on at the world.
