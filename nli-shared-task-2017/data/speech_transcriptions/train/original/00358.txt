I will <%1.0> invite them to Cancun because I think is really nice city and it has a lot of places to go like tourists and cultural stuff to meet like dancing folklore and all that stuff. Like I think those things are popular for my country so I think I would take them to that place. And I think they can know all the my cultures and pre-Hispanic cultures so they can mee- know a little bit more of history of my country and  because it's really nice place we, we have a lot of beaches and all that stuff.
