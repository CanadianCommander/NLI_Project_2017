What I miss the most whenever I'm not at home is uh my mother since uh when uh I'm not at home uh uh usually she does everything at home and when she's not she's not here uh like with me I'm like alone and uh uh I can do. What what what do I miss also is my room and all my personal objects uh since uh I use them uh often like my TV, all my novels, uh my computers. So uh that's what I miss the most when I'm not at home and um that's why I don't go often away and I usually come back.
