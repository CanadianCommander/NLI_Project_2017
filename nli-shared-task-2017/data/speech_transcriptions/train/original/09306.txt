The last book uh I have read is a book from Anthony Robbins called uh Unlimited Powers. Uh and I love it for two reasons. First of all because it speaks about self-improvement with very good examples. It is easy to to do it in the real life and second because it is a very well written book, easy to understand, easy to to to compare to acts of the life. So for the two reasons I have loved this book.
