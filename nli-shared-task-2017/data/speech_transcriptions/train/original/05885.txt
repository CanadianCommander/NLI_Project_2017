I had a great opportunity to work at my parent's office. I have two reasons for this. First, I major with accounting and my parents have accounting company so I could, I could use my, my knowledge which I learn in my university. Second, I didn't have work experience before so it was good opportunity to work at their company. Therefore, the work, to have a work at my parent's company was good opportunity for me.
