When I'm not at home uh for long periods I mostly miss my friends and my family because um I know that uh I can rely on them uh for example, when I'm  in trouble. I know that they will um give me good advice and good support. So uh for example when I was in Spain uh this summer my credit card <%> and uh I had to phone to mother in order that uh she uh give me some advice. Uh also I know that if I'm down or depressed my friends will cheer me up and my family will support me.
