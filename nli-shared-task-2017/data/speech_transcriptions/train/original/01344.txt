First thing architectures a student majoring architecture  I think accomplishment that required me to work very hard is my CC design. Because CC design requires both the CC's and the architectural design. I have to apply all the <%> that I have learned in the four years and I have to show my creation in how I design a building and this building must be coherently to the knowledge that I have applied to this project. And it's really uh I really require deliberately thinking and uh comprehension of of the knowledge I have learned. So that's an <%> a very hard work I require to do.
