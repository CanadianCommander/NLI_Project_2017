If, if I had to choose a career I would choose to be a veterinarian, to be a veterinarian uh because I do love animals and I think  animals beautiful and interesting to study. And also I love nature, nature it's always been my passion, uh I like to go outside to the outdoors and you know look at animals and uh walk around the nature and that would be the main reason why I would choose a career like veterinary and medicine. And at the same time I also, I would be able to interact with people but in a larger scale.
