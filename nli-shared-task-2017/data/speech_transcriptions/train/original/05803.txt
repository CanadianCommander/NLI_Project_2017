One of the accomplishments that I worked very hard for was finding a suitable owner for a stray dog that I found on the streets three years ago. And I worked very hard to find uh a suitable owner for that dog uh Cutie uh because uh uh stray dogs are very popular uh are everywhere in Taiwan and owners, finding owners is very important because people might not want him or her and then they will uh throw them away or send them to the dog pen so I worked really really hard to find the suitable owner for him and glad, uh and in the end I really did. Uh I looked every, I l- I talked to several owners and in the end I find a very suitable owner and it took me about a month to find a suitable owner for Cutie and I was grateful.
