The kind of books that I mostly prefer to read are philosophy books and uh the reason why I like philosophy books is because I actually feel like I am getting smarter as I read through this kind of books. They help you to reason, they help you to answer any kind of questions. They even help you to understand how people ages before you used to reason. That is basically why I like philosophy and therefore philosophy books.
