In my free time, I usually prefer the fiction because um it's interesting. It brings variety to life. Not that um none fiction doesn't bring variety of life, it's just that, I prefer fiction myself because it it takes you to another time stand all together. You can go back um you can go back to the past or you can come to the future and you can read science fiction will take you thousand centuries down the line and talk about how the universe is changed or you know, they'll take you back in pa- into the past and discuss how about the medieval times and the civilizations or fashion, not only science fictions and to <%> books, I prefer reading um action um action related books um like Jeffery archer's.
