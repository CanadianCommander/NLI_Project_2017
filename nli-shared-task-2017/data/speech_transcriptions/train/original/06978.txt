An ideal job would be a doctor because doctor earns a lot of money and I like finer things in life like luxurious uh bags or clothes. So if I become a doctor, then I could make a lot money and buy all the things that I want to buy. And secondly, doctors saves people and it would give me a great sense of achievement to be a doctor and save people and stop people from suffering illness and therefore, I'd like to be a doctor.
