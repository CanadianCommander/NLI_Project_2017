One of the most interesting books I have that I have ever read is <%> by Ayn Rand. Examples that I would probably say that I would still have with me here, one of them is about the essence of time saving. This is a point in the book where one of the main actors uh lives a big industry and goes inside of the small uh factory of its own in a small village. There he shows how uh he saved ten minutes which he couldn't turn use for his other things and thus save more time for himself.
