I will miss um miss my mother most when I'm away from home because, my mom not on- not only why she is the best me- female who cooks, but I can talk with her about everything and about problems, even about problems of girls, I don't can't talk about it with my friends, because uh I'm disturbing I'm really shy. Uh and the second person I miss the mo- the most is my, my sister, my little sister she is only eight years old. Uh as I saw uh as I see her growing I feel like I'm being back in the time, and I appreciate it, being at home.
