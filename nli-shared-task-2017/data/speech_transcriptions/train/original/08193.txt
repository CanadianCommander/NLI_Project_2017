The last interesting book I've read was uh the Announcement from Colin Fox. The book is about about <%> and special agent, American agent which landed in Europe to uh attack or to do an attack on Hitler but he failed and so he has has to go home but the problem is that the flight or the plane that will take him home is in Italy  so he has he has to get to Italy and then get home so um the problem is in uh American agent to go to Italy is real hard and that's what the book about.
