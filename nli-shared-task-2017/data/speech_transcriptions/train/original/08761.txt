I have lead, uh read lots of books in my life up to now but the most interesting book that I've ever read is uh the one that is Who Moved My Cheese. This book explains you, or gives a moral that uh you should not be lo- afraid of losing things or uh or encountering new things in your life and it conveys this message, the book conveys this message by four characters, four rats as the characters in which the name showed what they want to do in their life.
