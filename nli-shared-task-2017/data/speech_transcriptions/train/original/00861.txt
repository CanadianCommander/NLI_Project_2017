Last April nice opportunity was given to me uh as I was able to go uh and visit a friend of mine who was uh studying in Vancouver. And uh inviting me and I spend two wonderful weeks with him. And that opportunity was pretty important to me as it gave the idea of studying uh in North America. And it enabled me to discover a, a ve- a new culture, it was the Canadian culture and I really fell in love with that culture so love to go there uh for the next month.
