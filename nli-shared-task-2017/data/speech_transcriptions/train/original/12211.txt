What I miss most about my home when I live away I think my dog, my family. First my dog. I play with my dog and I have fun with dog and I played and I grew with my dog rest my life. Uh second is my family. Family help me a lot of things like give me and protect me and give me and provide some money and he ha- my my father help to educate more and more and I educated my school and academy in other things. Of those reasons, my dog and my family.
