Working in NASA organization will be, that's great for me. I wish to work there, because uh I, I would really like to just know how other planets, and is there any life in other planets and how they're different from the earth. I mean to make a trip or mission to other planets would be just wonderful. Just try to experience,exoerince and try and see how is the other space and planets <%34.2> and different from your own planet. And what circumstance or what atmosphere is likely to be uh in when you are there.
