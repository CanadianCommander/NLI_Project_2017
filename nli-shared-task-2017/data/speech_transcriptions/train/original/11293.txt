On January two thousand and six, I was given the opportunity to study a semester abroad in Vancouver, Canada. This opportunity was significant to me because it gave me uh a new perspective on things since I have never lived alone. And I learned a lot about my career and about living on my own and making decisions for myself instead of my parents making them for me. And I also had to learn to care of myself and um my, my where I lived. And also, make payments on time and worry about things I have never worried about before.
