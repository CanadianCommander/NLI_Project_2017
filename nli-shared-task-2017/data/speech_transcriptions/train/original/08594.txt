The special opportunity that was given to me uh was while I was doing my graduate studies in Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, Louisiana. The special opportunity was I was the Graduate Research Council head and I was supposed to organize meetings between the graduate students and the faculty, uh these meetings would be held once in a month. And then I had to organize events like graduate uh publication forums where you uh discuss about the things that can help in improving the research society. And then I also created a forum, a web forum where we could discuss about the uh various research ideas and areas and this would re- this helped really in, helping me in getting responsibilities right.
