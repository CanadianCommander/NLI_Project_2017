I think that um hard work is uh one of the quality that will make someone a valuable of a team. The reason because is a hard work really means a lot of effort and a person has to put a lot of effort and since everyone puts a lot of effort into the work uh the goal is really achieved and hard work will uh bring better results and produce um effective um results. So according to me uh hard working hard is one of the um quality that someone can have to be a valuable member of uh team. Uh in order to give the best results possible for a team or a group that is required.
