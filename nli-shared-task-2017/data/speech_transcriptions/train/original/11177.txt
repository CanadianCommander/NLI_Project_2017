The interesting book I have read is Harry Potter. Uh I think it is interesting because I really like the character in it called Fred and George. They are twins, they, uh they, they open a new shop with a lot of magical tricks. The tricks are really, are really amazing uh, they involve <%23.4>, a candy when you, when you eat it, uh it, it mel- it will allo- uh it, uh it will make you like you're, you're having a fever. Then the class teacher will send you home. However, if you eat another end of that candy, uh you'll, you'll turn, turn yu bac to normal. So I, that's why I think it's interesting.
