A valuable member of a team should have quality to be honest, because if someone is honest, you can trust this person. And if you trust this person, you can work together with him without having problems and without thinking about uh if he's really mean, if he really means what he is saying. It is really, really important to have someone in a team uh with whom you can uh coop-, cooperate and with whom you can make decisions. And if this person is not telling the truth, it is really hard to find uh a perfect way of solving a problem. That's why I think to be honest is the most important quality.
