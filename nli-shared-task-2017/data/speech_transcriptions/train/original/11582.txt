Well what I miss more when I'm uh in another place and my uh normal place what I miss of course is my family first but is not <%> this atmosphere atmosphere that I have at home, the all the small things of the daily lives that uh you miss. For example uh two months ago I was in Canada for uh in an exchange program and I was in the university and I was living with other other students, international students and I really realized oh, my um my home, my real home, my room the um the stuff in my room, my currency, every material thing can miss to me. Of course my family was missing but now there is email and stuff like that. It's easy to keep contact with them and to have views but your stuff your stuff your own stuff are really.
