Well, an interesting book I've read recently is the Perfume and I found it was really interesting because it was am- it was amazing to me how well it was explained. Uh how um this guy was legalizing smells and stuff and um as well um the characteristics of the woman who <%> explain really well the characteristics and places were described and it was so nice for me to to read because you felt like being in the story and this is been very very important for me when I read the book and um I learn a lot about history as well reading it and that's why it was really interesting.
