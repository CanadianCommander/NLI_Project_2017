One accomplishment that made me work very hard was the uh the ability to communicate with people. I was total introvert once upon a time but my teachers, my friends, my family they all encouraged me and they said you can do it. I was afraid to go on stage and to talk to people. And then I started practicing it I I used to listen to how people spoke and then I used to see how they uh how they presented the information to a lot of people, how they took care about presenting information to different kinds of audiences like children, like you know different people. So that is the reason I think it's important. I think it's important also because it has given me the ability to communicate my ideas and that way I can be a leader.
