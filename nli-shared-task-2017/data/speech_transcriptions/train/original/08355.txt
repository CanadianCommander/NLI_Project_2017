So usually during my spare time I like to read magazines and sometime sometimes novels, not so much poetry. Um and the reason behind this is that uh well you know like magazines give you like updated information on uh whatever your interests are. Um in my case there would be you know like a lot of um computer science, IT and technological um material. I find that pretty interesting. Um novels I enjoy reading as well because they're you know it's very entertaining and and easy to read. You can just read those in a matter of few hours.
