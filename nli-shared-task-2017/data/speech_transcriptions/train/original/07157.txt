An interesting book that I read today is <%> uh it's a book about two character very different. Uh the man uh is uh works in a small library he has a boring life and he doesn't have a lot of friends and on the contrary the other man is a huge <%> and then she has a lot of uh of friends. And then one day they met randomly and they fell in love together and it's funny how to see uh how this people love belongs to different background. Um can love each other or they can build a relationship. Uh the story is also very fun and finally I think that this book is very well written. That's for all these reasons that I think it's an interesting book.
