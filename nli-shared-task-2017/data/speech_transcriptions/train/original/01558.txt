I would proudly suggest them to visit this side of Morocco because it is most traditional part of my country because uh a lot of people are are amazed by what they ca- can find in this part of the country. And the north of Morocco is uh made is uh made of cities uh modern cities that are not so different from um European cities so it is not very interesting.
