The most interesting book I have ever read was Experiments With Truth by Mahatma Gandhi, the father of my nation India. It um tells about those experience uh with the truth and uh non-violence which he used as weapons for attaining freedom and independence to my nation. It uh tells about his um various experiments of truths in South Africa and also in India. It motivates me as a person to lead my life uh by using his principals of non-violence <%> as he termed it. Uh it occurs to whole nation to move uh ahead over this norm and is a very interesting book um to recommend on people.
