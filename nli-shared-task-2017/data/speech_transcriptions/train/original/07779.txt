I like to read music magazine in Japanese regularly because I like Japanese pop music very much. I'm living in Germany so that it is difficult to get Japanese information from friends or uh my family. So by reading Japanese magazine, I get this informations. And also, I'm studying music at high school therefore reading music magazine is good for me to understand the class more.
