I had a golden opportunity to come to the USA six years ago. It was a, a cultural exchange program between the, the USA and Korea because the reason that I think that was a special opportunity to me was that I had um there are two reasons because um I can learn uh English for free because the host family was supporting me financially. Also, I can interact with a lot of people who from other countries because there are so many others from other countries because there are so many <%> from other countries so I can interact, I can experience diverse cultures from them. Also, uh yeah for, for those reasons uh the opportunity was so special to me and I the, I had a really great time in the USA.
