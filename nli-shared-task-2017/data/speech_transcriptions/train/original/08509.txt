The thing I miss most about uh being away is uh my mother's food definitely. Uh there are two uh main reasons for that because first of all they are they are delicious uh they are home made and not like the fried uh fried uh things that are unhealthy, uh and the second reason is uh because all the time my mom serves I am uh very relaxed in my pajamas and eat it. Uh to sum up I like, I I missed uh home because of the food I am getting outside.
