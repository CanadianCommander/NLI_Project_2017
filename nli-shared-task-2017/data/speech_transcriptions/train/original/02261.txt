I was given an opportunity to play in the national rugby team, Lebanon. And I've been I've been dreaming of uh playing in the national team of Lebanon since I was a little kid. Um, the trip was to Serbia and Montenegro. There was uh a world rugby tournament and I wanted to prove myself cause I love this game since I was young, and I want to accomplish something great in this game.
