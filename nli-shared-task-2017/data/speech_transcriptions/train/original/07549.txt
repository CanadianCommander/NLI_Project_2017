I've uh recently read a book about uh famous writer who crossed the oceans and uh and uh traveled uh among the islands and and uh and who went to big stones and pirate attacks. This book was uh sort of adventure book and was uh really interesting and made me dream about this uh great times when the famous sailors uh crossed the oceans and saw wonderful things and magnificent islands and fight fought against pirates.
