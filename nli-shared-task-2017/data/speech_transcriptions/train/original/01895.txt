Well there are three things that I miss most when I'm not at home and these three things are my parents, my friends, and usually my room. Uh I miss my parents the most because uh we talk a lot. We're not like very uh television kind of <%> or something but we talk a lot and I need them to focus on my what I want to do and so on. I miss my friends too because we have lots of fun together and because I I love them too. And I also miss my room. I miss my room because I like to stay alone sometimes. I love I like to have things uh around me that I know uh that I know of and sometimes it's just useful and comfortable to be in your room for a little while.
