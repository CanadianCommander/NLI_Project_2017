Yes the career I want is information technology. That's where I am right now so I'm living the career I wanted to. But I would like to have a job in the United States because the information technology professionally in my country, which is Dominican Republic are under valuated. So we could have a lot of knowledge, we could use, we could develop experience through the time but we'll always be under valuated. So in United States where the information technology is in higher level we can build a real career and make money in order to have a better future.
