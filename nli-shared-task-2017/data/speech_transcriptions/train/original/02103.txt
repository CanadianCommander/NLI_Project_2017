I think uh there are two uh elements uh which make someone a valuable member of a, a team. Uh first thing is the enthusiasm, uh because enthusiasm is uh required uh to be successful in any uh kind of uh teamwork or group uh work. Uh in others words <%23.9> less uh to participate uh and uh to be successful. Second uh one is determination. Uh one should be uh determined enough uh to complete his task uh in order to be successful in any uh environment uh I believe.
