What I miss most about my home is my mom's food. Whenever she she prepares any any dish she always keeps in mind what are the things that I like and also when I'm not uh at my home, uh I will not be able to spend quality time with my family members especially my sister, I love her a lot. I love her smile, I lo- I love being with her and also I miss I miss my scenic splendor around my home. I have a beautiful garden around home, uh so I miss that. In fact what the other things that I miss when I'm not at home is is my sweetie too and my sweetie is a beautiful one and and I used to roam around in my city and.
