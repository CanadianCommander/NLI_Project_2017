The accomplishment which required me work very hard was conducting of technical event at the college. It required, it required my, to display my management skill in college. And the main challenge was to converse and to interact with students from different backgrounds and agree and agree upon them to conduct the event and streamline things and, streamline things and ensure that everything went properly without intervention of any of the management and no support from them. It's a completely student event.
