An interesting book I have read is the book Digital Fortress by the author Dan Brown. Dan Brown as we all know is a very famous author who has written a number of books which have had a global acclaim. What I like about Digital Fortress is that it shows the manner in which science and mathematics is a ve-, uh essential and key part of, of our modern life today. It basically shows the, show, depicts the advanced stages of cryp- cryptography and besides that it's also a thriller in which it depicts lives in danger and how the patriotic approach for one's, for one's country uh exceeds all selflessness, exceeds selfish beliefs of people.
