So my special opportunity is my parents and my, parents and my sister. My parents gave me all, all the money for study abroad in America from Korea. And my parents are always helping me about to study and exercise and get more happy and funny. My sister always worry about me for my study and my college. She will, she was always helping me and she was always thinking of me. I think that's my special opportunity.
