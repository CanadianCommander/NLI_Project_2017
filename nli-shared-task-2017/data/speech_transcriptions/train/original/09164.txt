The opportunity that was given to me was uh I was accepted through an audition for a 7Up commercial. And what was great about it was that I got to travel to a destination called Mauritius and I stayed there for three days and I didn't have to pay for anything, and uh it was good pay at the end. I got tired of, have a lot of fun and possibility, a chance for me to see a new place I had not seen before and obviously what came with it was good recognition from my friends who saw the commercial later on and I thought that was just a great opportunity that I had.
