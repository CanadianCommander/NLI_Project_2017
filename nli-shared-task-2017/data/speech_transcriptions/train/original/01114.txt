Um the special opportunity that was given to me was attending uh the American University of Sharja, um I don't, I um hold on. Well, basically I come from an average family and we could not have afforded it normally. But I was given a scholarship and hence the opportunity came. Now it was extremely important to me because it gave me, um it gave me the opportunity to enter a multinational um environment in which I first of all got to, uh to improve my own personality and at the same time, I got the best of education that was available along with it affected my career. I managed to get into Oracle and it's all thanks to the university.
