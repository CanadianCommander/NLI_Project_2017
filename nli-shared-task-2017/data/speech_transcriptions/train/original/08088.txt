Um when I'm away from home, I miss most my family. It's not like how everyone says, oh I miss my family it's kind of like I can just go up to my mom, and talk to her about something or the food at home is always special and gives me a feeling. And then of course my friends, because if you come to a new country I'm sure you make new friends very easily, but they don't know as much as you want them to know about you or you are not as close to them, and you don't know how far you can trust them or not. And then another thing I miss while I lived in a different country was especially talking my own language. I love learning new languages but sometimes you just really want to describe something with a special word.
