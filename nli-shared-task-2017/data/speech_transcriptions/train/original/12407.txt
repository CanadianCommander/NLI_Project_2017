Um I would suggest Rome, the capital, because it has a lot of interesting monuments like the Colosseum. It is the fulcrum of the Roman Empire. And furthermore um it has a lot of different things to see and, I mean every place where you go you will see something that will catch your attention. Even in the night, there are a lot of things to do in Rome. So uh apart from seeing the things, you can even have fun and go out in restaurants and have fun in pubs or talk with Roman people that can tell you more about the Roman City. And in this way you can understand everything about Rome and the people that live in.
