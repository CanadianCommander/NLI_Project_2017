I would love to be a fashion designer, that is one of dream jobs and careers. I like this because of how I was really interested in fashion design and into the fashion world. I think it's very artistic world in which you can express yourself by painting and you can show a view of what you feel through your clothes. I also love the artistic part, the way you can draw and the way you can create your own, you can express what you feel through your clothes. And I would love to be a big fashion designer and have a big career in fashion.
