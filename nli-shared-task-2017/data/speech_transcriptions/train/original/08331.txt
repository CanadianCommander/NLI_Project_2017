The opportunity that I remember most and that I cherish most was the opportunity given to me when I was in school, and this was that I had to go to a village and teach the little children there. This was a unique opportunity because it, it gave me a chance uh to do social service, it gave me the satisfaction to teach the illiterate children and to uh uh and by gaining education this children would uh uh would fulfil their dreams. And secondly, it gave me a chance to visit a village to experience the village atmosphere uh to see how agriculture is done. It was a learning experience indeed.
