If I could choose any job I would choose um the job being a teacher because I think it's really nice job to have. You have especially my country which is Germany, a lot of vacation and a good social system behind you because the state is covering every medical need, every medical need. Um further more you have many children and nice people around you and it's a really good opportunity to combine family and a good salary which is very important to me, and that's about it.
