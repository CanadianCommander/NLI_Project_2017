The most thing that I would miss uh if I went a- away from my home will be the my bed because I cannot sleep in any other bed except my bed. Uh second thing is that my family gathering during meals time and during uh our special time for TV watching. And also my recorder. My recorder is a very big recorder and so I cannot take it with me anyway. So, that's the most thing that I will miss mainly in my home. Of course I will miss also my mother, my sisters and others things. My neighbors also because we used uh to be very close previously and still. And uh.
