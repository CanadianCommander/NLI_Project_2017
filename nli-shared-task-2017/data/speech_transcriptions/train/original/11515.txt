When I'm away from home first I miss my friends and my family. Friends I can um have a lot of fun with we can join the evenings we can go to the cinema and with the family I can talk and go there to visit them. Secondly, I miss my bed and my washing machine um I don't like to sleep in beds which I don't know and I will miss, or I miss my washing machine because um I cannot wash my clothes whenever I like to.
