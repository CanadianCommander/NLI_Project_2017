Okay um when I'm away from my house um there are a lot of things I really miss. The first thing is um I really miss um my family especially my parents and um I also miss my little brother. And also um I miss sleeping on my comfy bed that is the most important thing, that's what I really miss. Okay and then I miss um the cultural food that we have in our house that is not provided in other countries where I am. And um, um I miss also driving like my car where, where I live back home, that's al- that's all.
