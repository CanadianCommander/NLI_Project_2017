I will bring my friends to most of the restaurant around Hong Kong because Hong Kong is one of the city that is known for the food. We have uh Chinese food that is from different part of the country such as Shanghai food Beijing food like all very <%18.4>. And also I'm going to bring my friend to the Disneyland, which was open like couple years ago. Like it is one of the smallest Disneyland in the world and it is really, really small and it has been known for the bad quality. So I would like bring them to see what is bad in Hong Kong.
