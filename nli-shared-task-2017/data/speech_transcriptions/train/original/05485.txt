I read a book about handwriting analysis called The Hand by Robert Brown. This book specifically talks about how handwritings are a reflection of our subconscious and talk about and talks about how once handwritings exactly reflects that person's thinking, his approach to life, um how even the dots on the eyes, this slants on the ears, everything is individualistic. It even subscribes to the point that no two signatures can ever be the same. It's very interesting, it's very uh informative. It talks a lot about.
