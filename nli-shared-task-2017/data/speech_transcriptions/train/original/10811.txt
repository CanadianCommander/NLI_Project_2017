The accomplishment that required me work very hard was designing a drawing in <%>. It was important for me to design the drawing and this because it was given to me by an employer who works in a prominent defense organization. If I would be able to design this drawing I would be able to impress him and gain an ent- entry into the organization which in turn can be a future to my career and a step forward step towards my career. The drawing took me for nearly two days to design.
