Um the best book I have ever read was the story of the little woman. It was the most beautiful book I have ever read in my whole life. uh it uh it says the the story about four uh four girls from the same family they are four sisters. They have no father, uh their mom was alive. Um and each girl have her own story, uh her own story love and uh you can see they are adventurous uh in their life and how they are surviving to live and to eat and to gain money.
