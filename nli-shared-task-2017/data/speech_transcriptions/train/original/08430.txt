One time I have a special opportunity that is to go to the church. Before I was, I wasn't a Christian, at that time I have a lot of the bad thing, bad activity but since that time I went I I attend- attended church I gave up every bad activity and since <%> I try to follow only good thing. And second reason through the attending the church I made very nice people who try to follow good thing.
