Uh since I study abroad uh from Istanbul uh I miss my family very much uh especially uh I miss my brother and my mother. It's hard for me uh to stay without them and I miss to talk to with them, uh I miss my mother's food and I miss to play basketball with my father and I miss my little cousins which are three and five years old. I miss them very much.
