The interesting book that I have read is Five Point Someone. It was written by a student about his uh experience in his college years, about his experience in college. Is mostly reflect the youth, it mostly reflect the youth and uh we can see uh and you can have the, how the character <%20.4> is more interesting for the uh more for the youth as the book is mainly involved in youth about, about the colleges, the uh, about the time spending in college. The Five Point Someone is appealing to more to the youth because it mainly involved in the college activities of the students, about their experiences and the things that they have done in college during their college days.
