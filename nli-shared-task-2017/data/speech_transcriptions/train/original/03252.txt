The thing that I most, that I miss most uh about uh my home away is my family uh there are many reasons uh but I do that for. Uh in them is that uh when your family is there, you father and mother uh there is somebody who we rely on. There's somebody who you go back to uh when uh and have problems. Uh, uh also uh when you have your family over there uh, if you, uh if you have a wife and the kid uh you have somebody responsible for uh and this uh there's a me of life. Uh, uh also uh, uh in your home uh where the  family is it's place where you're likable.
