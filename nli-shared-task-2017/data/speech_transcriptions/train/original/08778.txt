The accomplishment that I uh considered as important to me is that I got a chance to get into the mentors club, is the club that in our school. And I applied for that and I got, I got an admission, so that inspired me to work with really hard in that club. So I, that club is for helping exchange students though I really um, um had an effort to help exchange students towards this to create and, um and our school. And I managed many programs to help them, So I think that is really important.
