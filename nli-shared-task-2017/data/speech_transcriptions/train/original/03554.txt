Basically I'm a physiotherapist so I would like to choose an accomplishment that will uh involve me to work really hard is my PhD in manual therapy. I want this uh to be done for myself because as a doctor I can treat all the patients with the equipments with missionary all the time because I can't carry the uh equipments all the time to the patient's house. Because if if at all I did my PhD or graduation post graduation in my manual therapy I could be easily able to treat the patients with hands. Uh I can easily put my hands on the patient and give all the treatment techniques which would easily reduce the pain for the patient.
