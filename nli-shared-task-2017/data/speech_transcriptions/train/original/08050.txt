Uh there are many place that I would suggest them to go to visit but the Taipei would be city that I suggest. Taipei had surface for fun. They have the uh lots my markets there. Lots uh Karaoke. Lots place uh for example, you can go to a pub they are open twenty four hours a day and after after you go to a pub, you can go to another market and eat and it's some fun to enjoy the night life in Taipei. And I think Taipei would be the place that I suggest my friend to visit.
