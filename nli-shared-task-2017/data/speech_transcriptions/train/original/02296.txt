I would suggest to friends more to visit Munich because that's the city where I am living actually. I think it's a good place to get an impression of a country like Germany because it has uh great cultural background, it has museums to visit, historical uh buildings and so on. And it also has a great uh surrounding, the nature of The Alps and so on where you can do lots of things, you can go to lakes, you can go to the mountains. So I think it's um great opportunity to visit Munich because it offers uh different things to do and also I think if friends of mine would come to visit my country I'd like to show them something and I'm only able to show them the region where I live and not another on. So I suppose them to come to Munich to see the area first.
