The most interesting book that I read was called the Made by Elie Wiesel and I felt it was really interesting because it talks about the holocaust and the experience of an actual person who was, who lived through the holocaust and I real- I found it very very interesting and that's the book that I like the most. And um I remember that I wrote an essay on that book uh when I was studying an history about the holocaust and when were two and uh and this book really helped me to actually see the perspective of a child of the author Elie Wiesel and all his family were being, what he and his family were being put through um during the holocaust.
