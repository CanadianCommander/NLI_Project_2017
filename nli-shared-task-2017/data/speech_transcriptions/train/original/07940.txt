The topics which I've read a- read are Sherlock Holmes <%6.2>. It is an interesting book, I found it very interesting especially the way Mr. Sherlock Holmes investigates the case. Uh the <%15.8> with the help of cap he found, if uh, he will be able to say them, each of the person, the uh, the different qualities of a person uh etcetera. And with such great qualities and then I like the style of detecting it very much. That's why I like the book of <%36.8>, a detective story of Sherlock Holmes.
