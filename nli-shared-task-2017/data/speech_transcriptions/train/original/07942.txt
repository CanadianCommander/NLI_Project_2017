If I have the opportunity to get a career or a job, I would like to be a teacher because uh I think I like teaching and also uh I like children. When I teach I uh I feel happy, I feel that I can help others to learn what I know. Um I would like to be an elementary school teacher because I just get along with children and I like dancing with them and singing with them and just by looking at their faces when they know something new is just good for me.
