Special opportunity for me it's that when I was in junior high I got uh a chance to be one classmate, one class office with the money management,money management and the communi- and the communication with various people such as students and teacher um and this way I can practice my speaking skills with other peoples and things I um afraid in the public uh uh situations so um it's a wonderful time for me to overcome my shortage.
