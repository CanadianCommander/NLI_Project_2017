Um the most interesting book I've ever read was uh was the book called The Elephants and Pigs. It was about a young boy uh who was who was in who have this drugs and drinking problems and smoking and it was it was it this fight towards losing the habit and trying to be a nice person to help his family and continuing his education. That's why I liked it.
