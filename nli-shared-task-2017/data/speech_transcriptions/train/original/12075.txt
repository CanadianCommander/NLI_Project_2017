The latest interesting book I have read was Autonomous Child, is about about a thirteen year old <%> living in Ireland and it's quite interesting because he tries to steal gold from some gnomes. Therefor the society of the gnomes and the social structures is um described in uh very detailed manner. Um apart from this there are lots of innovations and um techniques described how he tries to steal the gold and there for it's quite interesting because it's technically detailed and also describes social structure and living together of different species
