I would suggest they go it's a city that I've grown uh I grown up in. It has a lot of grass, it's really green and there is always things going on. It's a city where the nature and a lot of modern buildings are combined. It also has World Cup stadium that you can play in and enjoy. And they are building a movie theater not far away from so we can go watch a movie and there are a lot of good restaurant around there. So I would go and eating with my friends to all of those restaurants and have a really very nice time.
