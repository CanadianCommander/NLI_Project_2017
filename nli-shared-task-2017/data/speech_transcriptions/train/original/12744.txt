I like to read Shakespeare <%> uh when I find free time uh and I usually read architectural magazines which are fairly of my interest as I belong to the field and I would like to form my horizon by reading biographies of different uh and great personalities of the world. So, so to increase my knowledge about them and to discover about their lives and the lifestyles and what they have achieved, the failures, the success.
