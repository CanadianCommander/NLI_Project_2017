I like to read uh novels. I read a lot of books. I've, I've always been called the bookworm in my family and  I love them because I think reading is so worthwhile. It's such a nice way to spend your time and it creates a world you can, you can live you can virtually sink in and spend time with the characters you meet there. Uh when I am not reading novels, I really love uh to read the newspaper because it informs me about everything important that happens in the world and I'm very interested in politics so I try to stay um up to date on everything happening uh in my country as well as in other countries.
