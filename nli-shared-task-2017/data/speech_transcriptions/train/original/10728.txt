First I think um a valuable member of a team uh should be very very organized. Um he should also be able to share responsibilities so that each member of the group can take a lead in one uh of the of the task. Uh a valuable member of a of a team should also be able to hear the other people and um to work with them, very with them. And that's uh learn with other people <%>. You have to hear <%> uh the other people. Uh but the best quality I think organized yes.
