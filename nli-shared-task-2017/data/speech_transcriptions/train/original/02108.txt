If I had the chance to uh choose any job or career I uh would like to, then I think I would go for an academic career. Uh this is basically because um of two reasons. The first one is that, I do not like um doing regular stuff or routine stuff everyday. And in academic career, I will have a wide variety of choices and I will have um a lot of scope of freedom. And the second reason is that I do like research. It's really a good thing to makes things that you believe they are beneficial for the humanity.
