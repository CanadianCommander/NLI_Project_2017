The book that I've read uh on my way to the <%> center actually is uh Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence and uh I thought it is an interesting, it would be an interesting book to read because uh it is uh very widely acclaimed and <%> then I also read references to it in other texts. So I thought that you know as part of word literature I should uh I should read this book. But uh I think that it is mostly known for being very sexually explicit. Uh I still think that D.H. Lawrence writing is uh very very elaborate and also the context in which the book takes place after the First World War is very interesting so it's a very different time to me.
