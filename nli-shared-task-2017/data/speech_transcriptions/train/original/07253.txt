The acc- the accomplishment that required me to work really hard uh was succeeding in my National living science congress when I was in my ninth standard. The reason was that uh I was a president at my school of course and I have to perform better or as better as my uh, uh senior battles. Also I had the chance to go to a higher level that is to participate in the international science congress and that would really help me to uh to get a really good seat in college and in further studies too. Uh also uh I had a chance to contest for a spell in my uh tenth standard so this accomplishment will, would add to my chances. For all these reasons it was my great accomplish, accomplishment.
