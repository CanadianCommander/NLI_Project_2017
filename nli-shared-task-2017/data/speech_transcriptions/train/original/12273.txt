They say books are a man's best things and I would like I love to spend a lot of time with these friends. Uh generally open to any kind of readings but particularly prefer reading novels in novels I prefer to read the genre of biographies and auto biographies of people that I admire and look up to. Primary the reason behind this stories uh is my ability to learn different perspectives and to run new ideas from whatever I read in this biographies. And uh they also give you and new look on uh on life and uh person's perspective on the day to day problems. Uh reading books is obv- obviously a big help.
