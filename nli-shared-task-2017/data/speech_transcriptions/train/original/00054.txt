Uh after I come to Istanbul for university uh a special opportunity was given to me. Uh it was a scholarship uh from a company of the richest man of Turkey. It was very important for me because uh my family uh cannot pay, couldn't pay all the money that I needed. So with the scholarship I can uh, uh have time for studying not working on a job and so it makes my lessons better. By this way I would go for Master in Europe.
