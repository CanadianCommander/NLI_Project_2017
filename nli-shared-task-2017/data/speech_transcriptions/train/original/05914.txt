Novels, during my free time I like to read novels by many authors because they are the real situation and they make you feel they entertain you. It's like watching a movie except you're reading it. They give you a lot of details so you can imagine things. I also like science fiction and like newspapers and because they actualize what what is happening in the world. I like read textbooks about history because it makes you learn a little bit more about cultures. I also like to read real life situations in novels.
