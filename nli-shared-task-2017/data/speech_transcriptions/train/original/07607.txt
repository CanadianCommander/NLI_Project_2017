During my spare time I care very much to read the newspaper since uh I work a lot and I do not have during uh normal days a lot of time to do it. I like reading newspapers because it will give you a lot of information about news, will allow you to read comments on the spectacles of cinema and a lot of things and it's really important I think. I also like very much to read some books, some novels, uh some very short uh history because they are very easy to read and I do not as I said before, a lot of time to it. So I like very much something that is quite concise and short and doesn't take me a lot of uh mind to think.
