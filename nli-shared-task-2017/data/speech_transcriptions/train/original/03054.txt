I would suggest my friend to visit Kerala where I stayed for about uh ten years. Uh Kerala has many places like <%8.8> and Munnar and <%10.3>. Munnar is a beautiful place where one can uh enjoy and relax. Munnar is actually a whole station and it has uh variety of spices grown over there. It's a <%24.0> is also famous over there and one can find a beautiful uh and tasty seafood there. And there many beaches, about seven beaches and one can enjoy a lot and they are varied. And they have different types of boats one can uh go for boating so I prefer Kerala.
