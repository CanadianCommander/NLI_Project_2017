The nice book I read was Seasons of Migrations to the North by Tayeb Salih. It shows the contours of the people living in the North part of, of the globe and the ones in the South. Specifically between the people of England and the Capital of England is often specially. And the people of South, Southern Sudan. Which shows that the, that in South, Southern Sudan, the people are really, have a really narrow minded of uptake of life but they, they, they don't respect <%27.9> at uh as like as animals. And uh that they, they, they make, they, they have to, to, to marry the man they choose. On the contrary in the North people are the open minded person and world wide uh, uh becoming recognize.
