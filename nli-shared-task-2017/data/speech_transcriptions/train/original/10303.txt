I've started becoming <%> I've been given the opportunity to decide whether I wanted to, to, to <%> to set up alone in the flat or to live, to continue living with my parents. Uh that was a very important opportunity because I was for the first time able to decide what I wanted to do of my living, what I wanted to, to do in my life, uh in which condition I would like to live. And this has been the first opportunity for me to make a wish that was really my choice and not my parents. Because um all the choices I had to face, all the decisions I've take in my childhood was my parents.
