The book that I would like to speak about is Toni Morrison's Beloved. It is a book which explains the poor conditions lives in South America and shows how they would, and shows exactly how ruthlessly they were treated. Tori, Toni Morrison's the Beloved describes the story of a bureaucrat, a woman who is slave and who is nine moths pregnant and has eloped, and has run away with her two boys and tried to save herself from a life of struggles and slavery. On her way she delivers a baby, a baby girl, a beautiful baby girl but she decided to kill because she knows that her baby girl's life is full of nothing but being bought and sold by the hands of one another and utter slavery.
