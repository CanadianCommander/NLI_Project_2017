I have been reading a, a book about the business uh stuff and the book was about the, the, the invest that the companies are doing abroad the <%12.9> for example uh the companies like uh <%17.7> invest all the money in one country, is better invest the money in more countries and later in the same <%27.0> in every country. Uh it is uh difficult to decide to the company, for example when the companies have a lot of money they can, they can invest in, in a lot of, in a lot of markets but if they don't have enough money it's better being one market and like uh continue in other market and be more slowly.
