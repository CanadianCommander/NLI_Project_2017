What I miss um from my home when I'm away from home is the cultural food, I mean the household food that my mother um members of the family cook for me. They are healthy, they are good for the health and they are more nutritious. Also I miss um very easily the um family people of the family I mean mother father uh who love us, who are the most important person in our lives and I always miss them. Most of the, most importantly I miss the family environment, the home environment. Uh being home, as there is always someone to take care of you but outside I always miss that.
