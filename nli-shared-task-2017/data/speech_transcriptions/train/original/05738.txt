When I am away from my home what you really miss is my mother's food and uh also bed because I'm used to sleep by myself in my own bedroom with my bed and my pillow so I really don't like uh sleeping in other bed so I miss that very much. And uh what I also saw my friends and my car. I am really used to to driving so, and I like it very much. So I, I prefer driving than, than taking the means of transport like train or uh even <%35.6> the bus, the subway, all those things uh that's why I miss, that's what uh I really miss when I'm away from my home.
