If my friend were to visit me I think um I would advice him to visit Paris. Paris is really nice it is really huge, uh you can see a lot of very famous buildings like Eiffel tower or some museum like the Louvre. I have been there a couple of times and I always enjoy time over there. Uh you can also enjoy a lot of different night clubs over there I, I knew some, some night club I spent some time with my friends and he was really funny. Uh then you can also see the castle of <%39.8>. I think it is a pretty nice place I think very it should be visit by foreigners.
