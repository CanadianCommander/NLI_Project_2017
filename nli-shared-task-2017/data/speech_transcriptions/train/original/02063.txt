If I would have a career or a job I that I want I would choose business. I like business for many reasons. First of all you have no limitations um your limit is the sky. you don't have any like bounded salary you can just do your business and earn as much as you uh work. Now business is um as another word, you have to be uh you have to understand all the um surrounding conditions in order to make business and you have to be understanding the environment around you uh different from the other jobs that you have just to work.
