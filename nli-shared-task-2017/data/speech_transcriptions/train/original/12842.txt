My father passed a way the last time I live in I lived in dormitory and uh I can live I can go off <%> and I have prepare the test for the next month that I feel very sad because I received the telephone from my moth- from my mother to tell the bad news. I feel really really  bad. My feeling is really really bad but after I test finish the test I go back to home as soon as possible. This is the most thing I think it's the most important miss in my family.
