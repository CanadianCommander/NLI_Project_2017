Personally, I think The Diary of Anne Frank is the, is the book that I think, that I think the most interesting. First the book showed me how war can destroy our lives <%12.0>. Through it's pages I realize how dangerous war becomes. Also the book is interesting because the author didn't lose hope and tried to live happily in the middle war time. As for me, I might have been scared with the fear of death. So I think The Diary of Anne Frank is the most interesting book I have ever read.
