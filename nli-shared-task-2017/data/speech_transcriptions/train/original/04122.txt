In my free time I prefer to read sports magazines because I'm doing a lot of sport, various types of sports for example I'm doing surfing and skiing and uh later I would like to be um a teacher for sports and so then my uh free time I can combine the intellectual academic work with my uh interest and hobbies and furthermore you uh you get to know a lot about nice places to go to where you can do surfing uh for example uh on Hawaii and you can just combine all the things I like.
