My career plan is to become a career diplomat, meaning that I would like to be able to be a bridge, cultural bridge between several different cultures. Important is to negotiate conflicts and try to resolve those conflicts within conflict, uh between conflicting parties. That's one of my major aims in my life, so I'm going to try to start a career and find a job in direction. Um I think that was my response.
