I think the quality which make one a valuable member of a team is this helpfulness. This is because if a person is helpful only then can his team as a whole win. The in spirit is very important. Also if one doesn't help the other of a team he cannot expect help. Hence in order to expect help you should also help at times. Also helpfulness is what ultimately he- uh goes, goes to help a person in life. If you do not help anyone um it is difficult for per- for a person to help back.
