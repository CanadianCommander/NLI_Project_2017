If anybody is visiting my country I will prefer them to visit two places. One is called <%6.0> and the other one is  Balaji temple but one is, one is related to the gods place and the other one is related to the historical place of Hyderabad. And one more the place I'll prefer to visit them is Charminar which is hundred old years and it is the symbol of Hyderabad. <%34.8> and uh both are the symbols they are the oldest places in Hyderabad.
