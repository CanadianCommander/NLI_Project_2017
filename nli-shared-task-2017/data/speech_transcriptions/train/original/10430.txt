The hardest exam was the the Chemistry exam that I had to prepare for. It was uh it needs it needs many research to do before the exam and to uh to really read long uh long long sentences uh out uh lined the the teacher gave us to in order to achieve uh good marks. Uh this was uh I didn't have time because I uh have to do many works uh in order to uh finish this uh research. So I didn't do it. Uh a- about the hard reading, um it takes it takes it took it take about thirty uh thirty pages <%>. So I think it's my hardest uh my hardest exam I have ever taken.
