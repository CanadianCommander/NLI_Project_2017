Well I enjoyed a lot of well uh well reading my biology books and I actually I was very keen about our nature and surrounding uh right from my childhood. Uh and after taking biology in uh graduation I uh I really uh read all the things about nature and our surroundings. I was really uh very keen to know about human body and it's sexuality. And specifically I was uh I'm I'm much uh interested to read uh nervous system that how can we react the means how how can we make a coordination between our body.
