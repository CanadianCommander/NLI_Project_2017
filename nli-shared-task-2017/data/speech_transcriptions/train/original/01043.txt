I have recently read a book about global warming which I think is nowadays a very important issue because uh it is clear that there exists global warming more than ever before since for example this winter is very warm compared to the other winters. So this might be effect uh of global warming and uh furthermore uh global warming also affects the whole world, it's worldwide so that's why I think it's very important to know much more about global warming or to know how to prevent it or at least uh kind of slow it down.
