I think an important quality that one needs to have you know one of us team members is positive thinking. The reason I think positive thinking is important there's something about uh general uh positive ideas amongst the rest of the members. It depend it often happens that sometimes when group is working they come to dead ends and they don't know how to progress and what to do next. And somebody is positive thinker and thinks positively he could direct whole team in fact even that group leader. It will be that the group progresses and moves forward. I think positive thinking is an uh is one of the skills that I would really like or quality I I I would really like in a team member.
