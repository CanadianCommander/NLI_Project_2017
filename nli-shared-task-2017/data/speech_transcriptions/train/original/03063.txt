The interesting book that I've read is called uh A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens and um I find it really interesting because the main character Scrooge's an evil guy who wants to become a good old guy and uh through the <%> his own business partner Marley. Uh he goes through all these stages of meeting spirits at Christmas past, Christmas present and Christmas future and through those stages he realized that what what's what is the real happiness in in his own life and that he wants to become a um happy guy in the end.
