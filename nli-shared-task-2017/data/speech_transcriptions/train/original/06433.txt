The greatest accomplishment I have made was that that I got a scholarship in music. The reasons why I had to work very hard for it was uh at first of all, uh I took practicing work a lot in advance to be able to pass the test to actually get scholarship and then once I had the scholarship, I had several lessons and year training and I had start at two different instruments and theoretical lessons back composing. So for all that, I I took practice a lot during the week and had to attend all the classes. I spend a lot of time for that beside school. Um well my rather great achievement was is um the reason for that is that I wanted to study music professionally at the university and for that it was great preparation. It could couldn't have.
