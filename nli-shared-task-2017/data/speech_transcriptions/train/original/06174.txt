I could have any job or career um I will choose to be an economist, especially uh an an economist in economic development because a lot of problem from our society uh come from um economy but I also think that a lot of the solutions come from economy. So I think that it's uh economy may help us to live in a better world and I'm someone who like economic work and economic is really uh logical mathematical and imply a lot of rational rational work, but in the same time there is this social part that goes with it which I really like because it tries to uh explain the social behavior.
