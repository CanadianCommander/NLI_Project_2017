I miss mostly my mother. She is the person I can convey a lot of ideas with. I can share many feelings with her and I love the way she cooks as well. My mother is probably one of my best friends, I think uh she's probably the person I miss the most about home. Uh my mother usually gives me good advice and directs me when I have mixed feelings or in it for situations. I really enjoy her company she also has a good sense of humor and at home it is essential to have a good environment and a good sense of humor.
