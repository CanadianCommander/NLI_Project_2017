The people that I miss most when I'm away from home. Firstly I miss my room, my room is an amazing place where I share a lot of things with myself as well as with many people and uh secondly I miss my parents. My parents are always there to give me emotional support so when I'm away from home I feel that I'm away from great two great pillars. And thirdly I miss the great food at home, uh my mum prepares amazing food so obviously I'd miss the great food and uh. So these are the reasons why I miss home the most.
