I read an interesting book and title Gone With The Wind. It's a book by Margaret Mitchell um it, which was written um in the nineteenth century. And uh I like this book because uh I think uh I really like uh the characters of this book who is carried around the <%> who both have a really strong personality. But uh I'm also keen on history and that's why I uh like this book because uh it uh describes uh a historical uh event, uh the American civil war and and we can discover these events through the eyes of uh the different characters. That's why this book is uh interesting.
