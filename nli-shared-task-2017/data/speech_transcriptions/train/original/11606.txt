I chose the TOEFL test as my accomplishment and the TOEFL test is very important for me because I'd like to go to Chicago Illinois to study Economics there as an undergraduate student. I have been studying in England for the time of one semester in the last year and yeah I get, I got in touch to the, with the English language uh for the first time and I liked it quite much. And now I'd like to go to Chicago because there are many Nobel Prize winners who, who give lectures there and I'd like to hear them and learn from them to fulfill my studies.
