When I am away from my home, I mostly miss my mother and my parental advice in matters of serious decision to be made. I seek advice from my parents. If I am away from my home, I would be missing the parental advice. I also miss healthy environment. And I seriously require an outermost secure place in order to expand my time. At home is ideal and the most secure place anybody can imagine. So if someone is away from the home, he would be desperately missing a secure place to stay.
