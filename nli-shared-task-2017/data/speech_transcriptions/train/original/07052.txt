A book I really enjoyed it reading was uh A Dangerous Fortune written by Ken Follett. It was a really good book and uh I read it I think five times. It's a story about um, um, it's uh, story about how a man can be ad- at first a victim and then can change his uh, his life and trying to get a and reach a better position. The story is about a murder of a little boy and no one will discover whose th- who was the, the murderer. And uh, uh the story is based I think uh, uh last for about.
