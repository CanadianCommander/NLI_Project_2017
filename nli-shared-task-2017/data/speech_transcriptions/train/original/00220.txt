Um my favorite book is um The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. I read the book in uh the school and I like it very much. It's about uh a young boy named Charlie. Um he's writing letters to uh somebody he doesn't know and is writing about his life and about he, what he um what he sees and what he um gets to know. It's very interesting and it's a very emot- a very emotional book. And it, I think everyone, everybody knows the feeling which are described in this book so it's very nice.
