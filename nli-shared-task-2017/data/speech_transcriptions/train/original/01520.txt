Okay um uh I like to read a lot of different things, I love to read the newspaper in the morning because I like to inform <%> get informed about politics, what is going on in the world or what also culturally wins, things like that. And in my free time, I mean beside newspapers I also like to read novels very much. I like it that from novels you can learn about history or some political events or kind of stuff through the eyes of a person because you identify with the person the novels is about and it's kind of it's literature but at the same time, you can learn something about the world um yeah and uh that's why I like very much to read novels.
