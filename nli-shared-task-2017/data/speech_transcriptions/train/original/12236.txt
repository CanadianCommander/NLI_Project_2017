When I'm far from my city I I miss most my my father my mother and my sister  my family practice. Because uh of course I I was born there in that family and and just think I miss is the family we uh I I live in my family. Another thing I I miss most when I'm far from my city are my friends because you go with them <%36.0> on it's different between the family because with family you have family time like you know lunch or easier to go to bed.
