High school um I was take photographic classes and then my teacher thought that I was quite good on it and then so we start to take and create some new projects about photography. We took photos and do some special things about it. And then they really like my photo and ask me that if you would like to an exhibition of your own name, your surname. It was a first because you know I was like just sixteen years old and they ask me to if I was okay I can open my own exhibition. Like to shown to many important like art professors and like photographic teachers and stuff. So I was very happy about it.
