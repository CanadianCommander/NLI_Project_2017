When I am away from my home, I most miss my bed. Uh I think I am a confirmist person. So when I'm away from my bed and from my confimity, uh I miss them all. Uh but more than that I miss uh food. Especially I'm away to another country uh eating those country's foods uh co- make a problem for me. So I miss them also. Of course not to mention uh I have to say that I miss my family and my friends when I am away from my home. I think this is what they call uh homesick. Uh this is my response to this question.
