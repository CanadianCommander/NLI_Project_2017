I think the most important opportunity I was given recently was um to work for a very important Italian investment bank here in New York City. Um I was hired about a month ago and it represents definitely a very big uh career change and career opportunity and I am very grateful for this chance I was given and um I hope to make the best of it and I hope to um stay here in New York and to work for this investment bank um as much as possible and to learn as much as possible from my experience.
