If I could choose any job or career I wanted I would choose exactly the one that I've all ready chosen that is environmental engineer. Why would I choose this specific job or career? Well I am a p- a person inclined to humanitarian help, and I was for searching for a job and a career that would help, help me or give me the opportunity to help people. I think environmental engineer in a way helps me help people, and it also has a very technical percent of excite to it. For example when solving water problems I'm helping people to have a better life.
