I will choose my career as a scientist, first because to be a scientist is my dream since I I was a little child. And I was a boy with uh strong curiosity to the all unknown things, and I think to be a scientist can will satisfy my uh curiosity about unknown things. And also to be a scientist you can tribute to the whole human society. Um for example if you are um a scientist of micro um of, of biology you can um create or innovate uh new kind of food that uh feeds the demand of some poor country which cannot afford themselves enough food. So that's that's why.
