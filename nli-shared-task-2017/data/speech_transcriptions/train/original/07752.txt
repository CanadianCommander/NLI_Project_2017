A quality I think someone makes um someone should have to be a valuable member of the team, is empathy I that because I think being empathic uh shows leadership uh sympathy to the rest of the team and it also demonstrates that he understands he or she understands what the different member of the group or the team have um or think. So he can summarize their opinions and lead the group well if he empathizes with the group members.
