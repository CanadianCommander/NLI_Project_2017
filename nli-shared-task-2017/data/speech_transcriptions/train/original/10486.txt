I will talk a book uh uh the re- book I read. It's called uh Cain and Abel. It was very interesting because it's a story of a Polish immigrant and of an American that uh they were born on the same date, the one from a poor family, the other in a rich family and they grew up in different uh environments. Uh the book uh portrays the life of both and explains what was happening with one. Meanwhile, the life of the other one was was running and it was uh very different. It uh explains a lot of uh history of both uh Poland and United States and it.
