I've recently read the book called Harry Potter. In fact I started with the the first volume of the series. Uh this book was very interesting to read because uh first it was in English and uh it was about uh a magic world. Uh I had seen the films before but I had some representation not necessari- necessarily similar to the one we can have by reading the book. So I could uh learn some more detail in that book and uh although as it was in English, I learned um some new words and grammar and so it was very interesting to compare with the film and for the English.
