Um my um uh accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh the third prize that I got in English speech contest. And uh this contest was had when I was uh in the final grade in junior high school. And uh I got third price in this contest and because I worked very hard I memorized all the stories that I have to read in the contest and then I made uh my best effort in the contest. Uh so it was very important accomplishment for me, and it was great in my memory.
