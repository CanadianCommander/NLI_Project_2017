If my friend came to my country um I would like to take him to go Cusco. My country is Peru and Cusco is uh a historic place where my friend I'm sure he will love it because it has a lot of uh structures that was build for Incas. And I would like take him to my town too. I would him to see how I live, know my friends and how my custom is I would like to take him to walks, to see the forest, to see the rivers, to see the birds and maybe he will be really happy with that.
