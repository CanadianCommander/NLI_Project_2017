When when I travel far away from home I really miss uh my family. Um I miss my mother, my father and my brother and especially the thing that I miss is the way we interact with each, other the way we share our feelings and uh way of thinking about uh the thing that happen in the world or in the day that we have passed that. Um I also um miss a lot the food, it happens when I was in Barcelona during my uh <%> studies that I miss a lot uh the food.
