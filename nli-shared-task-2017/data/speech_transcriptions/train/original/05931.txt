Mostly I miss my parents. First I miss my mother's food which is really delicious. Uh at outside at home I can't afford food like that and I mi- miss my dad because he always take care of me and I always have fun with him during weekends and his time. And secondly, I miss my room because I think my room is m- mo- is most comfortable for me to stay. And there are lots of things that I like like computers, CD's and guitar and drum like that.
