In summer I was away from my home, for three months I went to Germany and I missed most the meal of my mo- mother cooks and they were really really nice and also I missed my sister and I miss to uh I miss about my home having a nice breakfast in my balcony and having a nice site through the sea and reading my newspapers on the Sunday morning and uh also I missed my home for watching uh watching films on the late time because I didn't take my computer with me. And also for my home coming to home and seeing that my my room is waiting for me and having a nice cup of coffee in my room.
