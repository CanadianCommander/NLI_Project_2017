Well there are several things I'm missing when I'm not at home for a longer time or even shot time. First of all I miss to see my friends and hang around with them. Go out in the evenings and spend just spend a lot of time with my friends. Apart form that I'm doing a lot of sports at home, playing tennis and if I'm not at home I can't play tennis. So that's a very thing I'm missing while living from home. Another thing is that just my hometown, Aschaffenburg is very nice city where you can do a lot of things in your free time. That's what is missing a lot when I'm not at home. For example, you could go on the Mine River, go uh jet skiing and everything and yeah just do nice things and that's what I'm really missing when I'm not at home.
