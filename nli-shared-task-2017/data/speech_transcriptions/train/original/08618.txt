I would first show them the Champs-Élysées during the night because I think Paris by night is really romantic and really special. There is like something going on in the city by night and afterwards I'll I will show them the main monuments 'cause Paris is a l- also a lot about culture and about old buildings and uh and how people uh how people act in the city, how people are. Uh actually there are also nice bars I can show those friends and maybe my house.
