In my opinion the most important the team-mate has is the skill, skill is one of the most important things that are required in the team I want to have. Because without skills they would just case disturbance in the team and be a burden. And If you have skills you can lead the team or you can tell people what to do and it makes the work much more easier and comfortable to go with. It also makes it can also cover people with unskilled people to work as well. Skills in my opinion skills person is the most valuable person.
