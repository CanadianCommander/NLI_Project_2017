Uh I am a person uh that lives away form home uh because of my uh stu- in uh others city. So uh I mostly miss my uh parents and my uh sisters because uh being away from them it's really difficult. I also miss uh things in house uh in my uh home that I uh don't don't have in uh uh in the place that I'm studying uh which is like televisions uh or uh microwave, such things like that. Uh so that's why uh these are things that uh I mostly miss.
