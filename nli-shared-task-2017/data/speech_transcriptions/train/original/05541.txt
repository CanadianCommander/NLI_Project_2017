Uh I like reading magazines as uh I find magazines more interactive uh in in the sense that you could you know you have a lot <%> and different uh different reading structures are much more interesting. Uh it's more like comic based so that you know you could uh get a whole a picture in your mind when you just read uh read them out. And you don't have to read the whole magazine, it's more like you can get the whole picture you can get the undertstanding of what is being uh displayed there by just looking at the picture. And besides that magazines are more interesting and fun to read.
