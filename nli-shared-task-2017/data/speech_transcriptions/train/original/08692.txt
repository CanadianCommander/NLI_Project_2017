If I could have any job I'd stay in the job that I'm right now working as an HR manager. I absolutely love the HR field the Human Resources field specifically because it is it involves with uh the people aspect of the company working with the employees, working with people gives me that extra thrill, makes keeps me motivated to go or keep working. I also enjoy the legal aspect of the field which make sure that you know we have all kinds of um compliance with the federal and state laws. I also enjoy um counseling people the working with emp- employee relations, performance management and guiding people to help to work better and thus help the company achieve their goals.
