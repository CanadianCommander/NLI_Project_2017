What I miss most about my home when I'm gone on vacation is probably my room because it's my personal space. Everything I have in there is mine and I chose it. It's very particular, but I also miss my family even though most of the time when I'm away on vacation they are with me. If they are not I will miss their presence, I also miss my pets, I have two cats, a girl and a boy and I I like to play with them a lot of course in my home we have a big garden so I also miss that because I like the garden.
