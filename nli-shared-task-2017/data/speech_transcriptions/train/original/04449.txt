Well um first of all I would like my friends to visit <%6.3> because that is my home town and that is where I come from. And I would tell them to decide the <%11.7> and um introduce them to my friends and my family here. Of course they will also have to visit Berlin because that is the capital of Germany and has so many important sites like the <%26.3> things like that. Um also they should go to Hamburg so that they would see the coast and the sea. And also maybe go to Munich so they would see the differences between the Northern Germany and Southern Germany because I think that would be really interesting, um yeah.
