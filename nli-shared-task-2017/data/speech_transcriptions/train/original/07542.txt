Well then in my opinion, a member of team must show a several abilities for one thing, he should be able to help others. Um for example if someone has problem and can't help himself. Um for another for another thing, he should um be able to communicate well um and of course he shouldn't be selfish. All in all um to be a member of the team is a quite demanding um activity. Um in other words is selfish um is a negative thing because <%> is is much better.
