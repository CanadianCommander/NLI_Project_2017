A book I read um that I really liked was uh The Girl With The Pearl Earring and I really liked it for three reasons. First of all, I really like art and the book was uh about uh story of a girl who was a maid in uh in a painter's house. So I really felt like I was uh in this house with her and I left with her and the painter which was learner. The second reason why I really like this book was that I studied literature in <%> and arts so I'm really interested in this um issue and so I could um.
