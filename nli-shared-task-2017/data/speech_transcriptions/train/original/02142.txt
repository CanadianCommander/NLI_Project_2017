If some friends from another country were coming to my country to visit it I would recommend them to go to the south of the country where the Patagonia is. Uh there are many glaciers and lakes uh to visit. And uh as well I would recommend them to go to the north where the waterfalls called Cataratas Del Iguazú and uh there is a huge chain of mountains in the west of the country called Los Andes. Uh at, at last I suggest them that uh go to uh Buenos Aires. It's a very impressive city that uh.
