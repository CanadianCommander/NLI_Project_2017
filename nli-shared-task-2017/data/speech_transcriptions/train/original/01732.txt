If friends from any country were going to visit my country, I would suggest them visit Istanbul because Istanbul has many historical places, many museums, many mosques, interesting and the nature is also beautiful there. There's the sea. Uh you can either swim, either surf. Uh there are uh l- lots of spectacular views. Uh the view from the Bosphorus, for example, uh traveling along the b- uh coast is uh very enjoyable. Um and there are many bea- beautiful uh a- and luxury restaurants you may show your <%>.
