Uh my favorite book And Then There Were None from uh Agatha Christie because I think uh there was a lot of suspense and this book was very frightening. It was pleasure to read it and I couldn't <%> um um stop reading uh it day after day. I think the description of each person uh of each uh person on the book was very interesting and we could have a good point of view on their personality and then each one die one after one. So it's my favorite book.
