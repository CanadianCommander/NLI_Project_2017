I work really hard to get into university and therefore I worked pretty hard in school to get good marks and um to to get good marks and to um be able to make the final exams. So the marks were good enough to get into university and therefore I had to write um different essays and had to do a test and um because I got into university I thought it was good working hard in front of university and in school and now I'm able to study.
