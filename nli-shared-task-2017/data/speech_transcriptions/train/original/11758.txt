I think there are many valuable uh quality that a person need to have to enjoy a team or a group, but the first thing I, I think it's more important is to be able to communicate with people and to, to be friendly with people so that, that person could really uh be member of a team. And it has, another valuable team it's to be a sincere person so it can really give uh the feelings they think about something or really be able to communicate what they think it's true.
