The most important uh things I miss when I am away from home is uh one is my child uh and uh my parents. Uh I miss talking to them and spending time with them, uh which is uh the most uh uh peaceful part of my life. And um also um I get relieved whenever I spend time with them. Even though I get the chance to talk to them on the phone uh but uh uh I really miss uh spending time with them. So that's the most important thing I miss I think about uh my home because is most peaceful place I stay at.
