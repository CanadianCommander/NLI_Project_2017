Of course there are many special opportunities I had. If I had to choose one I would select the opportunity to work at uh an institute at the university where I study. So this was because of this, I had a coach. So this a, this is a person who is uh, yeah who coaches you during your studies and he is chief of this institute so he offered me to work at his institute. And this opportunity was so special because it gives me the possibility to work there at the team with doctors and <%> which have high degree and yeah it's a good way to make networking and find something.
