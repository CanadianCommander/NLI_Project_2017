I like to read most novels about of these specifically of the nineteenth century.  Why novels? Novels because they imitate real life, they transfer to us experience of the earlier writers and it's by nature that we somehow identify with the characters in the novels and share their experience and uh in the end there is this sort of catharsis relief in addition to the gaining of the experience of the writer.
