Okay I sometimes miss so many things before uh I live the house. Let me see. First of all, I sometimes miss my car key. So I have to go back my house again. And uh I sometimes uh I miss my wallet here. Both of them are very important to our business in our sides. So, I s, so many times I need to go back to my house and I need to take back. So I, I think I most of my friends said to me they describe about my I'm uh absent mind. That's a kind of bad habit to me. Okay that's just it.
