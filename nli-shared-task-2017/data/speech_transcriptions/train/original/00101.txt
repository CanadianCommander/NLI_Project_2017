One of my favorite books was Lord of the Rings from J. R. R. Tolkein because it create such a new and beautiful world and he also creates new creatures  such as hobbits and dwarfs. He also has new languages and he gives so much details in his books. All the landscapes are beautiful, descriptive and he writes in such a length he can mention all the things that you would see also in the movie about it. The book was very long and it was really adventurous and has a lot of action.
