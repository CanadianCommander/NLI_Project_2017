I miss my family the most because my family, because family is my treasure and I think I al- I also miss my pets because I love my dogs. They're sometimes annoying but like my dogs are like my best friends and as I I also miss my mom because my mom is like my best friend and we talk everything together and we go shopping and I I also think I I miss my mom's cooking because my mom's food is delicious.
