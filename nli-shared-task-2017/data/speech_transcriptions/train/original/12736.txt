Well, uh a qua-, a quality that is valuable in a team uh would be uh being  uh hard-working, because uh generally when you work in a project with uh three or four other people, uh everybody relies on someone, on a leader. And the leader has to uh, to, to give a the, the most of the work in fact. And so uh without a leader not, everybody uh, nobody does anything and the project uh doesn't go on. So, uh in a nutshell, uh, haard-work is the most valuable quality in a team project I think.
