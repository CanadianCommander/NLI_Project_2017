I would like to work in underdeveloped country uh in more specifically in a democratic uh policies and strategies. Uh first and foremost I would certainly like to work with uh countries that are in the lower income countries. Where I can help to achieve development and to fight unemployment and the work on economic growth. Uh most importantly I would certainly be involved in legislative reforms, in economic reforms, physical and political reforms. Uh, uh I would certainly start with the parliament uh and through those law fighting corruption is a very important issue as well.
