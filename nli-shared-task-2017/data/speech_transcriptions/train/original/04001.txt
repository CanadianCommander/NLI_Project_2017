Uh I like reading novels especially uh novel from movie. Uh recently I've I read uh Bridget Jones Dairy which is uh uh became movie and I really like because I can uh while I was reading and I could imagine that I could remind uh the novel of the movie so that uh that I could imagine the actors with the characters in the novel. So I like uh reading novel and also it is uh uh very imaginative for me so uh I can dream about myself and um the novel itself.
