Uh I was given an opportunity to study abroad for my degree um, uh, uh I mean the whole scholarship basically. And uh this gave me the chance of travel a bit in Europe and, and to study in a different culture. Uh it was a good experience to, to begin with. And I can't really think of anything else uh.
