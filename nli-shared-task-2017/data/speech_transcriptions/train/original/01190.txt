What I miss most about home when I'm away is mainly the physical presence of my parents and my sister. I think uh it's all about the love and comfort and caring that you get at home that's one thing that you mostly miss when your away from home. Uh another thing that I can mention here is the cooking at my place, I I love to eat home cooked meals and uh I'm not the kind who would like to try out different things on my own. So that's one thing that I <%>  miss. So basically being familiar with the home environment and being comfortable is also one of the things that I miss the most. So that's how I would sum it up.
