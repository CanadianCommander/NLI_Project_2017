If I could choose any job I wanted, I would want to be manager especially in the field of marketing because um I need a job that's challenging me and I don't have competitive task where I have to do something different everyday and it's just, it has to be a fast paced job and um because I'm a very competitive person and especially as a manager, you have to be aware of your competition and aw- aware of your own strengths and abilities and I am aware of my strength and weaknesses  and working um improving them or getting rid of the weaknesses. So yeah, manager would be ideal for me.
