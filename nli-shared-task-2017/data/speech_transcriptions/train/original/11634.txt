If I would uh have some friends for holiday, I would try to show them Berlin because Berlin is the capital and Germany. Also the seed of the German government and I would prefer Berlin for sightseeing tour because there is a lot to see like the Brandenburg Tor the Brandenburg Gate. Um like I said the government and also very nice spots, there are a lot of things to shop in and a lot of things to see. So I think Berlin would be the city which is most exciting for foreign visitors.
