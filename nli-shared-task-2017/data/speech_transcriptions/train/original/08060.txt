Um a special opportunity that was given to me was um I got offered a job to uh run uh the kitchen um of a restaurant uh here in <%13.1>. That is was very important for me, it was what I was looking for since I've got to do mistakes to be able to control a kitchen. And uh to control all the procedures uh that were on it. Um and it was also important for me it was uh my work cho- chaos to do for living things uh I love uh home.
