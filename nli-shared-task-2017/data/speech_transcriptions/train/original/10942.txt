Most of all I miss the people, my parents, my friends. And second it's my home my rooms, I, I collect many things like writings and DVDs and stuff. And um when I'm at home I, I like looking at them and well it's pretty much it. And if I am abroad I, I miss my car, I have a little sports car I like driving, and if I can't take it with me, that's uh something I, I miss also.
