Well I have many friends from different countries so I would say that if if they came to Montreal or if they came to Quebec, what I would like to make them discover about the city uh there are many things of course. I would like to stay away from usual tourist attractions. I think I would bring them to <%> Tamako Market and probably on a Sunday morning because it's really uh it's really casual. People are there with kids, with with animals and I think it's it's a typical uh it's a typical weekend day there. So when I get there. I would also bring them to the <%> which is the big mountain in the city so they appreciate uh the season depending on when they come on the season they come. If they come in winter they can do the sport and all that.
