I think the most important uh qualities that someone is supposed to have in a team is the friendship and to be friendly and become and loyal. If someone is really not friendly and is is very difficult to reach him, it doesn't make sense to be in the same team because he will be always very aggressive if you realize. He's gonna be also very very much, you know, un-sharing the information and develop you are doing in the team. So that in my personal opinion, um the friendship and the loyalty is the most important measures one is supposed to have in the team. And in fact, uh this is also very effects also very important uh to effecting the other member of the team so that um the team can be the one body in a team.
