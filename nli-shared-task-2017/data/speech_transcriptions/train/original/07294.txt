If friends from other country were going to spend time in my country I would like to show them the place of my my home town. That is uh and I take them to my house so that they can come across the culture what we use and how they can know how much we are attached. And they will know the customs and cultures of our place here. They, they know the way of living here, the way of living which was before in our day, they come across the uh dressing styles and different styles of the people of my place. And so that they can they know well about my country and uh attachments which we have here how the people spend time, so I lie to take them to my hometown that are them showing something else.
