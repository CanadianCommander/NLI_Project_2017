My suggestion would be to go to Rome because I found that Rome was a beautiful city when I went there and especially for uh culture and um for the shopping and for the people. They are very open and friendly. So um it's an example or of how Italian can be. Um after being in Rome I would suggest to go to the south directly to Naples or to the island. Well it depends on how much time they have to spend in my country. But anyway um these are the cities.
