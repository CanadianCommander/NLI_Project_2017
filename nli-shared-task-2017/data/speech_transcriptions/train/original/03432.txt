What I miss most about my home is when I'm far away, is my family and my friends and places that such as the club where my friends meet. First my family, my family is one of my precious things in my life and I really miss them because each one of them has an an um each one of them has influenced my li- li- life very much and they are very valuable to me. Also they are not able to travel with me so many places because, they're most of the times busy in the work uh that they're can't leave in town. Also friend's my friends who are um who are raised with.
