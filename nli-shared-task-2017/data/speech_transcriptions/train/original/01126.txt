That book that I want to talk about is called The Fountainhead by, the author's name is Ayn Rand. The book is based on the philosophy of objectivism. Now, anybody can ask the question, "What is objectivism all about?" Object-, objectivism is about living your life for yourself. Doing things which you think you should do to live a reasonable and rational life. In uh the book The Fountainhead, the hero is an architect and he builds buildings to live his dream. He does things for his own self.
