I think that honest is a very important uh feature of being a very important quality of being a team member because without honest no one else can trust anyone. If you're not honest to your team members they can rely on you and uh therefore the team doesn't work. There uh there is a saying that there is no I in team and uh if your not honest to your team members you betray them, so honest is and pretty much the most important quality of a team member, that's what I think.
