I have a problem with my family and it's that my um both of my brothers are not very communicative so I'm uh I have to be there so that they show me care. And that's what I miss most when I'm away and it's the moment of being in my room and both of them coming inside to tell me what they've been doing now just to be there, both of them in the room. Um I don't know to to jump into me or do whatever. Uh anyway I would also miss for a long time away uh being able to deal with both my parents and to ask them about how their day have been.
