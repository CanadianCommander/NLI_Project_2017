A special opportunity that was given to me was uh the study abroad. Uh like three years ago I came to Moscow to study only English, then I just studied English but I was stayed here, in Moscow like for uh one year. And uh I learned a lot of things about English and I met many peoples from uh, uh different countries. Yeah it is, it was very special for me to meet different peoples and uh I know better a lot of Moscow's. It was very great experience for me.
