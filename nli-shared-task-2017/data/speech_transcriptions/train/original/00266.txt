I like reading mystery books and uh science uh mystery books and scientific books because uh they are interesting to read and uh they give me uh, I don't know, information about stuff and and there's a lot of hard grammar that I can learn about from those books. And and I basically read uh any type of book that I can find but uh I only read about ten books each year so I don't read that much in total.
