A quality I think makes someone a valuable member of a team is to be uh responsible. In fact, it is an important quality for a team or a group member to be responsible because uh it is important for the group to uh uh achieve the results of a certain project and therefore it is important to uh do all the things that uh the group has settled for uh each single uh member. Uh therefore I think that to be responsible and reliable is one of the most important qualities to be a valuable member of a team.
