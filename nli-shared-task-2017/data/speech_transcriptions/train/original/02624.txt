When I am away home, the things I miss most I would say is my bed. I like my bed very much because I sleep very good in it. Second thing I like about my home is my big balcony I have. I like spending time in my balcony when the sun is shining. And third of all I would say I miss my family the most. I like spending time with my parents and my brothers. They all still live at home and it's um nice spending time with them together at home. Uh the other thing I like when I'm at home is of course uh my mother who still cooks and washes at home. So it is uh you don't have a lot of things to do at home because it's done for you and that's uh very nice being at home. So when I'm away, I mostly do my things alone and then you miss your mom.
