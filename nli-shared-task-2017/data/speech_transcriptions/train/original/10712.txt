Well I'll suggest my friends to come and visit my home town of Lyon it's a beautiful city. It's actually the second largest city in France. Um it's beautiful, it's very historical. It used to be Italian then um belong, it used to belong to Savoy and it was French I guess in eighteen forty. Um there's a lot of international students living there so it could be the opportunity to meet new people I mean French people but also to share their experiences with people from the same country or from other countries. I would definitely advice them to come down to Lyon and visit this is beautiful city.
