I guess the thing I miss most uh about when I'm over here is really the ability to just do nothing. I mean at home I can just be myself without having any uh fear as to the repercussions of my actions or without having any thought as to what will be the outcome of this action. Uh I guess apart from mom and dad and family as usual. What I miss most is the ability to just say okay, now I'm in a safe place, now they're no games. Now I can just be myself outside to what <%> always. You got to think about your next move before you actually do it. So that is what I miss most about not being at home. They're ability to just be myself and do whatever I want and be happy with it actually.
