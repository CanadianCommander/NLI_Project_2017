Opportunity that I, that I move I, that I transferred to school was my biggest tra- opportunity because the first that I was attending had small <%> and I had to learn English but if there is not many students then I can learn English more and if I didn't make many friends there then I couldn't be able to speak more. And the third thing that was important wa- to me was that I, that the second school has art classes and I had to ma- prepare for university and it was really important to me because I need to make many pieces as I can.
