What I miss most when I'm away from home is first my family, second my computer and third the television. Um first my family because um I like, I like uh it them very much, and it is my family it is normal that they miss me. Second, the computer, the computer I use it to talk with my friends and to chat with them and go to the Internet to find some research some information about anything. And last and third the television because when I don't know what to do, um I, I use it and I, and I watch movies.
