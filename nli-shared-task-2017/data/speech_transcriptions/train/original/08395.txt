Uh in my first year of uh study at the university I was majoring in mechanical engineering department, but after that I realized that I'm more interested in computer engineering. So uh I wanted to have a transfer to computer engine department. Uh but for that I had to uh had, a, uh really great GPA uh to get the transfer. So uh I had to uh work hard to uh get the GPA uh that's high enough to make me go through computer engineering department. And I had a GPA of four uh and I uh transfered to do computer engineering and I'm very happy about this and I love my work after I graduated for, from the computer engineer.
