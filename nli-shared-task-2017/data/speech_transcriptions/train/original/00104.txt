I read a lot of business magazines like India Today, Business Today and Business World because I learn a lot about the business I'm working in uh the financial field and the whole knowledge of the country and the world in those fields. Other than this I like reading fiction books because uh other than Monday to Saturdays where I work Sunday is the only time I get free time and to unwind I think fiction books are the best partners to read all the time and have a good uh way of unwinding.
