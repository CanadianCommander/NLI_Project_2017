Well, uh if friends would visit me um who are from another country um, I would show them Munich I guess because Munich and Bavaria has all the typical things um, all the stuff which is important uh typical for Germanese. I would show the October Fest, the beer, um the sausages and the, the way the people live in Munich because I think it's the way they live there is very special and very rare in Germany. And so I think this is most beautiful place in my country.
