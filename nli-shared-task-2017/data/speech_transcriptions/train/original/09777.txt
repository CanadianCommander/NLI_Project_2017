When I go abroad in different country, I think that uh the thing I missed most about my home is um the the food prepared by my mother, for example because I like very much to eat pasta and the Italian food and so when I go, for example in Britain or in German uh I feel not very fine to eat uh that food and thing like this. But um other things that I miss uh are my friends because uh when I live uh alone uh it's hard to uh to stay uh in another country but uh maybe I can uh hear them uh by phone.
