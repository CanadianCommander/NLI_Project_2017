If I could have any job or career I wanted I would like to be a motorbike mechanicians. Actually I have been studying for a couple of years to prepare for that job and I went to college on that subject as well. I study mechanical engineering at the uh <%18.4> university for a couple of years until I got here for army reasons. Uh my reason for it is that I have an interest in being a mechanician for a number of years now. I've loved the motorbikes since I was very young and I think I could make a pretty good mechanician. That's why.
