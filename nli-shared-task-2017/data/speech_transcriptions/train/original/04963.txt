Well from my point of view I prefer reading novels during my spare time uh because uh uh at first there is a story which is told and you can imagine all the characters and all the places where the authors uh uh the authors to that talks about. And uh moreover it is uh longer than a magazine to read and it is much more easier than a poetry to be understood. Uh I like very much novels because uh you can have very different kinds of subject that are um that are uh in that that we can find in novels and very kinds of uh <%> many different kinds of authors write in different uh kinds of ways so it's very interesting for me.
