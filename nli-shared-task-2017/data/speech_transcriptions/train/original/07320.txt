I lived in in To- near Tokyo in Japan and uh there are very many very nice places to go in Tokyo visit. I would recommend going to Shinjuku and Harajuku and Shibuya first to have a good time shopping there. And maybe visit <%19.5> to ride thee Ferris wheel there and see the harbours this is very nice there. And also the <%24.3> in Kamako city is one of the most famous places to visit in Japan and uh the lightening gate in Asakusa is also very famous place I would take people around every spot riding the subway.
