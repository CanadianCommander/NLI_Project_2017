When I'm away what I miss most my family because I have a very big family and I see them very often, so that is very difficult when I don't have the opportunity to talk with them, that is the same with my friends of course. What I miss also when I'm away from home are the traditions, the traditional parties and uh things that happen in the city and then where, where I used to go when I'm there. Uh what I also miss uh are the pubs and also the bars and restaurants in the town where I used to go. Um I also miss the city view and uh the atmosphere of the city, and uh.
