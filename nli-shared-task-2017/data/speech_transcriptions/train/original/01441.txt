I read a book about Anne Rice and there's vampires and the way <%4.1> living and it's very interesting because I am really fond of vampires and I have a lot of photos in my room hanging and I like the way they live and the way they deal with life, and how they see life, they're more spiritual than human beings and Rice explains her book very specifically and in details about uh how they do things and how they explain things in life which are really different than human beings in which they are more.
