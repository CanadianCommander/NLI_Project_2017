I like reading novels. Um I really like English literature and I'm usually interested in reading um old English classics . The English classics <%> are of Thomas Hardy and Jean Austen. What I like about this English classics is that they take you to a different Victorian era. The literature is very rich and uh you get to know a lot about uh the old uh Eng- uh the style of peoples living and the culture then. I also like the characters which are described in these novels and the theme of these novels which is very appealing to me.
