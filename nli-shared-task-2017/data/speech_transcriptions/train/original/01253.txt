Okay my advice for my friends of the other country is visit to Bogotá. Because first of all because Bogotá, Bogotá is the capital of, of Colombia of course. Um they can find Bogotá uh a lot of museum a lot of cinemas. Uh he can find that Colombian town like Candelaria and the transport system of transport is excellent. Then they would be happy to take a bus to take a TransMilenio, to take a taxi the transport is cheaper. Um in conclusion the Bogotá is the best place in my country or the foreign people visit.
