Uh one opportunity that, that I received um was to go to Patagonia to work as, in a national park uh as part of a internship program where it was possible to learn about the natural resources, about the tourism in the region, in this national park Patagonia, in the Chilean side. And also important for me because it was my dream to be there, to study there because my degree is tourism or tourism management so that's why it's the best opportunity that I had ever.
