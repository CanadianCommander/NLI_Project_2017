An interesting book I read is with Murder on the Orient Express written by Agatha Christie. Uh it's mainly a criminal book. Uh interesting about the book is that Agatha Christie uh encourages the reader to think what the story and uh mainly create some hypothesis about what was going to happen next. And uh really captures the interests of the reader. And uh therefore gives them the opportunity to take <%31.2> wi- with uh, with the book and uh create his own ideas about the following uh thi- scenes that are about to happen. And that grab my interest in the book. That is all.
