My, according to me the mo-, one of the interesting book which I read till now is Power of Positive Thinking by John <%7.7>. It was a book, which, uh which tells, which tells us like at the time when we are dealing with a lot of problems we should also, we should always think abou- uh we should always have a positive thinking. The positive thinking help uh to change our lives and the direction to think and in, at that moment when we don't know what the answer should be, to think positively. And it tells that if we think positive the the that is the most uh the most of, most of the problems will be eradicated with more time uh according to me.
