The most thing is the most when I are away my home is the people in the family. My family is included of my mum, my dad and three of my sisters and they're my beloved in my life. My mum always comfort me and give me uh uh lots of pieces of advices that I can uh tender with my homework or any problem in my life. My dad is very humorous and my sisters are really good partners for me to conquer some problems so the people is the most thing I miss when I'm away from home.
