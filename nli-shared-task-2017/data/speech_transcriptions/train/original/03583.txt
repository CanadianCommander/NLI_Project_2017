I think um a valuable member of a team is a tolerant member. Um I think tolerance is very important because um it enables people to respect others, and uh to treat them fairly, to respect other behavior, and um to be open for other ways of life. Um in my opinion this is very important um because often people from other background and with other ideas have to work together, and so it's very important in a group um to be tolerant and um respect this other ways of life.
