When I'm away I miss two things at most, uh one is the warmness and the sincerity of my family members, my parents, my sisters. And especially I also miss the meal that my mother make because she cooks so well that when I away I can't find the same taste in in any other food that I eat outside. So I can say that my mother's meals the the meal that she cooks is the first thing that I miss when I'm away.
