The great opportunity that was given to me uh was when I uh went to Spain last year for an exchange semester. And um because it was great for me and very interesting to see uh the new culture and how people are living there, the kind of food they are eating, and um how they live through their days because is very different from our German days. Um they live until late at night. They sat up until five o'clock in the morning, that is quite normal. Like for example I have five uh different meals, and it was just very interesting for me.
