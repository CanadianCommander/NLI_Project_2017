Um I would like to talk about opportunity that was given to me when I was in school. And uh this was that uh a group of us had to attend uh special classes uh for certain subjects and this gave me the opportunity to meet other students from other colleges and other schools and um being able to discuss with them the subject and their idea about it uh was very interesting. And uh to exchange ideas and learn more from others is what I learned from these classes. Uh so it was a place where we could mingle and and discuss our ideas uh which was a very good and helped me later uh be able to mingle with other students when I joined for the college. So I would uh say that this was a special opportunity where we had to take class.
