Uh after graduating uh with computer science major which is pure IT programming, I have got a good opportunity to work in the State Audit Institution in Oman. There I have shifted from pure computer major in the IT department to more interesting field which is IT audit. Uh the field is new in the country and needed a lot, so this will give me a good opportunity, opportunity if I want to shift to a new job. Uh the, uh the the new field which is IT audit is also, will provide me an opportunity to get a better salary if for example I move to a bigger and uh more important company or organization.
