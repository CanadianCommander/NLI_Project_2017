When I'm away from my home I miss my family. Uh my town and my friends um, I really I had travelled so many places and um the other thing was the homesickness. I really miss my home. And the when I was a small kid I used to play in the garden in my house. So I like I miss the garden and playing there in the garden. Uh the homesickness it's a heart problem and we have to solve it.
