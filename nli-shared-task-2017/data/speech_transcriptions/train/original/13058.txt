If I live away from the home the people I miss the most is my father. I think my father is a good person, he have many friends and I think the friends is very important of a person. And uh he is knowledgeable he know many things about different subjects and uh he always uh teacher me this thing or that thing in the home. And uh I think if I leave from the home I will miss ho- miss him so much. Uh I think my father is a a good, good person. That's all.
