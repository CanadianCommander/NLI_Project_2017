The thing I miss more when I am far away from my home is the affection that only my family and my friends can give me. There's the sensation of safety, the fact they can always rely on them makes me feel so protected. I miss so much all the food because I spend one year in England and I was missing so much the food and uh especially I was missing my, my family of course and my friends but also the city that I live because I was really linked to my city and to my uh family and to my grandmother especially, cause my grandmother is really my best friend and I miss her so much every time I am away.
