What I miss most about my home when I'm away my family and my friends. One example for this is that I miss this the, the ability to discuss problems of everyday life with my mum or with my friends. What, what is very important to me. Furthermore, I miss my own room and my own bed where I think I can't sleep uh the most I sleep best in my own bed. Um um and it's very important for me to spend time with my friends for example doing sports with my friends what I miss when I would been in uh on vacation for long time.
