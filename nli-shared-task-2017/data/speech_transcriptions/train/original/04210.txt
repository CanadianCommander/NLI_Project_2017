An accomplishment that required me a lot of work was was a ballet class. I remember that I was a little girl and um I had to take an exam at the end of this class. It lasted nine months and it was really important to me because if you passed the final exam that you have um you could go to the next level and to the next level uh you can go also to a different kind of school and practice more and learn more about it. Uh I was a little girl so I remember it was really really hard for me because it was the first ballet class that I took but I remember that I enjoyed it really really much and I loved to do ballet and to go to the next school.
