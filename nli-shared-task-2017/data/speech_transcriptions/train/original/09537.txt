If friends from from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would tell them to come and visit Santa Cruz, Bolivia. This is a city where I live. I consider this would be an excellent excellent place for them to visit because it's a pretty big city, the people are very nice and there are lots of <%> l places to visit. Besides the access to these places is very easy and it's not expensive at all. We have a great variety of sceneries from tropical rain forests to um um to missions and all kinds of places you can go. It's lots of fun.
