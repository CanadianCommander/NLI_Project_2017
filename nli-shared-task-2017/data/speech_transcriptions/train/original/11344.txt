The special opportunity which was given to me was going on a world tour that I can go anywhere around the world. There was lot of options for me to go all the across the world. I've been to Europe, America, London, all these countries and that was a good opportunity because it increase my lot of learning, it give my, it gives me experience how to talk with other people, how other people thinks about each other, how they communicate, how they learn new things and how they adapt to new things. Another thing about this opportunity was that I was able to express myself in other countries and share my opinion with others. That was a really special opportunity to me uh of my life.
