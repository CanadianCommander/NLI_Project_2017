I was given an opportunity of life to start the mentor program in the company that I was working in before I moved to US. It not only made me very popular in the whole of the organization, on the other hand, it, it helped all the juniors to have to have a pleasant introduction with the seniors and have their fears go away. Also besides this, all the people had now, now had somebody to go in for the grievances or their problems and uh for guidance too. So it uh, it helped me a lot in improving my career as well it made, making me uh very popular and it, it uh and I got the op- very special <%> because of that.
