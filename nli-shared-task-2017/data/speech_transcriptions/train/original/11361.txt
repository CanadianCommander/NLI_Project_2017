When I know that there's a certain aim that I need to reach then I work very hard at, for it because I know that there is no other way to get to that aim and uh uh it is important to me because I want to make it, I wanna make it there and it is really important because it's the goal of what I want to reach and without that goal I'll probably not get far in my life or anywhere else. So I would work hard to get fur- further in my life and further through education or whatever it is in life and uh yeah is, it is, if there is a certain goal that I need to reach then I'll work hard for it and very hard.
