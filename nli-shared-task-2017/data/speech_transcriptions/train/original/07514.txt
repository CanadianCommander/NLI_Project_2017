Well if anybody came to visit me in my country the first place I would definitely take them uh after landing at the Cologne on airport is, I would take them downtown Cologne to see several of the old Cathedral which I believe are pretty impressive not only due to their size, but also to, to their imagery and their ideal state. They represent and they represent as the people of that time. Then uh I would definitely have to take them to Bonn to uh see the old state capital and uh to make him visit um, uh museums and arts shows. And I guess Bonn will be a different, definitely a good place to do all these things.
