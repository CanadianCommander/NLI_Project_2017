I think a valuable member of a team is a person who has leadership and are friendly to the teams, because in team things, you have to work together so, you need leadership to cooperate with other team mates. And if you're friendly and kind, you maybe a little bit more better to explain what you want and they'll, it'll be better to explain. So I think that leadership and being kind is the quality that someone needs to be a valuable member of a team.
