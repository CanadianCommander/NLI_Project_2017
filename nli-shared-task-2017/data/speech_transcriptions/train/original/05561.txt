Well, first I would make them visit Paris and see the Eiffel Tower or the <%> and some places are that are very symbolic for France. And they would also make them visit um different part of our country because for example the south is very interesting for its countryside and also <%> are very uh void has very void countrysides and so I would also make them visit the Alps because a lot of countries don't have such mountains. So it's maybe interesting for them and um.
