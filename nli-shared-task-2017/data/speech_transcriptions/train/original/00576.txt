When I finished school two years ago I had the opportunity to go to London for a month uh to improve my English skills. And um it was really important for me because um before that I, I just um wasn't <%16.4> the whole time I didn't go in another country during the school time and I really enjoyed um staying alone. Um I, I improved my self confidence and I got to know a lot of people from all over the world and I really enjoyed uh staying in another country for a long time.
