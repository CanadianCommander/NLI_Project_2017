If my friends from Korea will visit New York, I would suggest Manhattan to visit. Because Manhattan has many beautiful shops to buy something pretty and valuable for trip. And also we ca- we have uh many like uh grand and great museums, so we'll see very historical uh materials in the museums. So is, is gonna be a very memorial time, and also we can look around the central park to spend.
