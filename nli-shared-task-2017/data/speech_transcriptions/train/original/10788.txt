Well uh lately uh read the Da Vinci Code, uh the famous book written by Dan Brown. Uh he won lots of uh prizes for this book in which he talks about the Christian community, uh it's a very mysterious commu- community. They have their own cults. Uh in, in this book he shows us how the, the Bible was changed from it's original, original uh text and written text. Uh I really appreciated it because of uh his clarity and uh honesty of the book. He doesn't hide anything and is not scared to talk about uh.
