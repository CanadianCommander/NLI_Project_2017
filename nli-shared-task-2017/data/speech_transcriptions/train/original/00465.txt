In my free time I really like to I prefer to read novels because uh they are really uh they are rich in uh in knowledge and in terms of uh knowledge about characters and uh the way uh an author prefer to write his uh his novel. And uh it's really important to understand the motivations uh of uh well, of uh of an author of an author and well, I think it's uh it's kind it's good to to read novels 'cause your it also gives your ima- imagination uh it help the mind to imagine.
