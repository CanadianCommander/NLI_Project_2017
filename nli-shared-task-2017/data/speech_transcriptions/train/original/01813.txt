I'll think that any any person if he is a valuable member of his uh team he should be honesty honest, trustworthy and sincere. And he should have some special skills. Without honesty and trustworthiness any member uh can cheat and then uh they can not confirm as currently as any other members of their team. And then if one has got special skills he will add up to the total success of that particular team. So I believe that uh any any part- particular person in case if he's honest and trustworthy he can be valuable member of a team. Which is valuable skills he can really make the team quite successful.
