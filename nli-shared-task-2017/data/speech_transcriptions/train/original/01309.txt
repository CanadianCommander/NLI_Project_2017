Well when I'm away from home I'm I'm probably most I miss most about my parent as well they have living with me together for seventeen years all along. And all along they have been by my side and always giving me support and everyday I came home uh I I when I go back to home talk to them tell them that the day's activities. So if I'm away from home I'm probably most miss talking and communicating with my parents and uh it's changing life and jokes in the daily activities.
