In my opinion, uh the magazines are most useful things of what I read during my free time, but uh because it contains the the information uh regarding current affairs. For example what what all things are going uh going around and <%> contains short stories uh about the most popular and familiar people in the society and um I found I find it more entertaining than the poetry or novels in my free time to <%> and refresh myself. So I prefer reading no- magazines.
