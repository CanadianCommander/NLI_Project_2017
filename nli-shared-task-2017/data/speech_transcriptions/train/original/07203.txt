A quality that I think it's really important for a team member or even team is communication. You have to be able to communicate with your team members to know what people are thinking so you could come up with a better idea, because you have the opinions of different people. And also communication make the people in your team uh feel a part of the team and part of the answer and not only if you're a leader you just like decide what you want to do, but if you're communicating, you listen what your team has to say, you're able to express all of the ideas of everyone. And also communication is important, because uh, oh my God.
