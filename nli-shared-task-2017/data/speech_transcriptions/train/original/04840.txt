The thing I miss the most with my home when I'm away is my parents my little brother. Uh I think I'm s- I feel so close to them that when I'm away I feel like a baby and crys I miss them so much. For example I was in VancouverBc last July and I spent one month over there and  it was so hard to know that my family was so far away from me. And uh  the fact that I was alone in the middle of nowhere was really hard and the time I spent over there was on one hand great but on the other hand really difficult to be so far away from the people I love.
