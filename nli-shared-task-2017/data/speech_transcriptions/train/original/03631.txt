The job uh that I most desire to pursue in my life uh is to be an <%8.6> in equine, which means that I take care of horses and medical problem in horses. I'm all ready pursuing my residency at Ohio State University, but uh in order to work in private practice which is what I want, I am going, I need to take a license. And in order to take the license exam I need to take the English test that I'm taking now. Um I really would like to work in a large referral practice, uh and having chance to see uh major case load.
