Book that I, I've read it's The Lord of the Rings from <%5.0>. Because I think it's uh very interesting book and very well written. And there are a lot of characters, interesting characters and a lot of very interesting situations like the start and the ambition. And you can, you can find on the book a lot of very good descriptions. And I, I also like and prefer uh fantasy books because you can find um very uh, beautiful um description of landscape and strange situations.
