The quality that ma-, uh that makes someone a valuable member of a team is leadership quality. If a per-, if a leader is not perfect, then automatically the, there'll not be a team spirit in the team. And if the leader is not proper, then automatically the team will not have success and no mutual understanding between the people will have, will, will exist. So, I think leadership quality is most important for a, of a member in a team. And uh for example as for <%35.9> is concerned is not a perfect leader, because he's not, he doesn't have any leadership quality. Uh so the important quality for I think is leadership.
