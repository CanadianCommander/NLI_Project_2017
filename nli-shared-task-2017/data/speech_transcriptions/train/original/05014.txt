The quality that makes someone a valuable member of the team is that he should be truthful to all of his uh team members. This is one fact which gets him close to everyone and moreover the people in the team will uh trust on him. Having trust in a team will help in the success of the team on the whole and this is very important on the individual basis uh to have this quality. If for example the the members of the team don't trust a person, every step of him will be looked at with his with doubts so the team will not move ahead and just will get stuck up with the the doubts that they have towards each other. So I personally feel that being truthful to all other team members is the most essential quality for a person to have in a team.
