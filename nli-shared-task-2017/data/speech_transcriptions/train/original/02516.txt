I like to read books uh about other countries and other cultures um especially um reports from from traveling um because it is interesting to learn about the countries and the other cultures and the habits of the people there and the difference in um well the development of history towards um the well the culture that is existing now and uh by reading these books I wish to look beyond my own experiences in my own country and um more to be open um to to other cultures.
