According to me, the most valuable feature a member should have to be a team member is, listen to the people who work under him and with him. I can see this is the most important quality in him because by listening to others, by giving them respect and by understanding what they mean, there is a cordial relationship and a friendly relationship which is uh developed between the person an the employee. So I feel it's always better to listen to people, give them a chance to talk and give their opinion, un-compromised and settling and find out a solution to anything. This particular quality will definitely help a person lead the team effectively.
