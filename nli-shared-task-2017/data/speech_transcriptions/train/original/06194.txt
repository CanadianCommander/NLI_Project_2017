Interesting book which I've read is an autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi was a great leader and freedom fighter of India. He has led India free from British rule. He has his own rules of non violence and he is, he has received so many tortures from the British. Still he has worked hard in a views of non violence. He has brought freedom to our country s- so the people call father of the nation to him. The best book.
