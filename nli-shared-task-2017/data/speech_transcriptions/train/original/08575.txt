Getting into high school. In <%> my high school I had take many tests that required knowledge on different subjects and before, I didn't know how to uh speak English therefore I had to learn by reading books that were unfamiliar to me. Also, we had oral test and other kind of written tasks that I had to accomplish and it was a very difference di- difficult experience for me.
