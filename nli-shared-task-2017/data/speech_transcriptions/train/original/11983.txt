I would like to be a doctor and as I- is main job for it is to save lives. And I think life is a very precious thing that only um a person can have once in a lifetime. And I think as there are a lot of um developing countries which, developing countries which are too poor to um facilitate their own medical service. I hope that is a doctor I could go and help them and increase the chances of survival and better living. But as I'm not studying science I could never become a doctor but then it is my dream career.
