Yeah the most the most thing I miss when I leave my hometown is the food I think because in my hometown and a lot of people love the barbecue but now the stay the city I stay in do not have so many people who love the barbecue. The second thing I missed is the is the friendly people in my hometown you know. We grow up together and we share the same culture together and we have same language and we have same habit. All those things I missed and uh uh a lot of my friend will go back to Hong Kong during holiday and when we are together we really have a good time. And uh and that time wishing we can go back to our childhood.
