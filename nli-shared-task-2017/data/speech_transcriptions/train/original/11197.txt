The most thing that I'll miss about my home is my room, my bed. Because it's very, very important to me, it's very personal. Everything about it is about me, and so when I leave home I'm not going to see then any other room. So unless the pictures the wallpapers, they the choice that I put like personal and they will be in my home, and so I leave it I will loose my perso- I will loose that thing. That's why I miss my room, that's the most thing I will miss about my home.
