When I am traveling away from my my house, I'm missing my family of course because it's very important for me. I miss my pets, my dog and my cat. But I think above all, I miss my house because I've always spend all my life in this house in my little city and I love the atmosphere of the house in this little city. It's quiet and it's peaceful. There is not a lot of people and when I'm traveling I miss that because it's it's all my life. So I'm very sad with not at home and I don't like big city. I prefer my quiet and peaceful life.
