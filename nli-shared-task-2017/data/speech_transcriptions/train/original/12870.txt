In early school I noticed that I am able to think very logical and that logical thinking is very easy for me. And so later I'd choose the, the course computer science which um make my life I would say it's um later I'm started to study computer science and try. Now I'm working for about three years as a computer scientist and I want to do the masters in it. So I think the logical thinking helped me a lot doing my way in uh, uh topic of computer science.
