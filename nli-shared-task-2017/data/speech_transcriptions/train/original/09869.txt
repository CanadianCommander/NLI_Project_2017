One of the opportunities that was given to me was when I was in my college and uh during my communication time I was given the opportunity to um decorate the uh the function that was going to occur, and um I was asked to um um lead the team for decoration and I had to plan everything um from the financial details to the different patterns of um decoration. And that was really important to me because that was the most important time of my career when I was getting my degree. And so was it important for others because parents would also so it was.
