If friends were to come and visit a country or city, or city place or town or whatever, I would suggest them to visit Istanbul because Istanbul is really a great city. It has um it has very many historical sites, it has the Bosphorus which is amazing to most people. Moreover, it is two continents on one maps and not many countries have that. It is also half Asian and half Euro-  European and I think people should visit Istanbul because it is very interesting to see.
