If I could have any job or career I wanted, I wanted to uh a tourist, because uh if I became a tourist I can get to travel everywhere, and also I can go to everywhere that I can learn other country like cultures or languages. And also I want um I want to use English for my career, and because I live in US for like three years. And I think tourist is good career for me because I like to travel a lot.
