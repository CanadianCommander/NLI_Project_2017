I miss my friends when I'm away from home town because we used to go for the movies and we used to go to the movies and we used to enjoy very well when I'm at home. So that uh where we are gladly go to the movies and gladly playing the games and we used to play the cricket everyday when I'm at home. If I go away from the home then live very difficult and I won't play the games if I go away from the home. And then there is no ground, there's no friends to meet. so that, so I want to be at home and I don't want to miss my friends at any time. This, and do I miss my mother? Yes I love very much my mother.
