One of the reasons I wanna in, in future I'll be a dentist. And one of the reasons I choose to do that because I found out, in my high, in my high school years I found out that I'm really good in science and math, especially uh biology and chemistry. So I choose to be a dentist or anything else in the medical field, because uh my dad is a doctor and I just wanna be something similar of what my parent are doing.
