I would have to say that um there are two main things that I miss about my home when I'm away. The first thing is, I miss my room. I've been, I've traveled around um many foreign countries for um for quite a period and staying at a room that is not yours um staying in at a room that is not yours is really you don't really feel comfortable in it and it just doesn't seem like you're at home. And another thing I miss about um home is having time to um spending time talking to my parents. We are pretty much like uh really close friends so it's always very um satisfying being able to talk with them.
