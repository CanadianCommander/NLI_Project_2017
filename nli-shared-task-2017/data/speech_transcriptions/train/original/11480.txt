What I mean by home here is San Francisco Bay Area not the place I was born and raised which is Japan. I was studying as an international student in the San Francisco Bay Area s- studying last August in last year and then I've just come back home to Japan. What I miss ab- uh the most about it is the air of the freedom and the liberal environment. As I'm career woman it was very uh comfortable and encouraging to live in the San Francisco Bay Area where in Japan I feel closeted and not free.
