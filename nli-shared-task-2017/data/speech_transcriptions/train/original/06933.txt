The interesting book which I have read recently is What Religion Is by <%>. Why I prefer this book is very much interesting because along with the interest, this book teaches the student or anybody about his religion. For example, in this book it's been clearly stated that religion of anybody, of any student, of any person, whatever it is he or whatever religion is he in or whatever <%> he does he belong is very important to inculcate the basics in him and along with that, how he should response to his elders and many new things which the students should have or any person should have form the basics of his life. This is a very interesting book that I have read recently <%> What Religion Is.
