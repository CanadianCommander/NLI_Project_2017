A special opportunity that I have been given was when I decided to, when I decided to change my major to because the first major that I choose was not the one I that I, that I want to work in for the rest of my life. So now that I changed my major now I'm <%> and I already got my degree as an engineer and now I'm working and I earn money. And I'm independent and I can support myself in the way that I want to and I, the way that I have been used to being support.
