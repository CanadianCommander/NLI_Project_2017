I like reading stuff like science fiction and I also, I also like reading motivation stuff. Uh reading science fiction gives me an update about the possibility for <%>. And reading motivation stuff uh motivates me to be a better person to do better and to challenge myself into doing the unexpected. And reading motivation stuff also makes me believe that the limit to which a person can achieve is uh imposed on him or her only by his own thinking. If I change my thinking I change I change the world. And this is the motivation that I get by reading such stuff.
