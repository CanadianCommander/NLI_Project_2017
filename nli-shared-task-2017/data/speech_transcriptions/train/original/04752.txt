In my spare time, I like to read magazines. I like to read magazines because usually in school I have to read a lot of materials about school work. I'm economics student, and all the things I read um are about microeconomics and macroeconomics so my spare time I like to read magazines of my interest such as the The Economist and People. The Economist is related to what I study so I find it a very interesting magazine to read about, and People is a very light reading which means you don't have to dedicate a lot of time to it and your concentration level is low which I usually read at night before going to bed. I like these kind of magazines because they are relaxing and they're fun to read. They're very enjoyable.
