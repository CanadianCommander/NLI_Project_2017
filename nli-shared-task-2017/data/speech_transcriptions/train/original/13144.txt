In my opinion, a group member should uh should process uh cooperation in order to be successful in a team work. First of all because um uh these members should bring ideas and point of view to discuss with the group and interchange um uh their information. Um another quality is um hard, to work hard. Each members should be hard worker because um uh he should do research at home and bring information to discuss with the group member instead of bringing false information to to a group. So for all these reasons, I can say that cooperation or hard working is the most important part.
