I could choose a job I like to be a teacher because I like interacting with students and I think it's uh really interesting and you can learn a lot of things from them. Besides uh you can uh give them a lot of uh useful information for their life and learn from their experiences and besides, they can learn from your experiences and it could be uh really rewarding uh to know that they achieve the good things based on the information and everything you can provide them.
