Well what I miss those uh when um, uh far away from my home, is probably the kindness of people and uh and uh the beautiness of the region. Because uh people are partly so cold when you see them the first time. And uh suddenly so welcoming, because they are not consummated to, to welcome people very well. They must first uh learn to know them and to uh and to um to trust them before they have their uh the best they've got. And uh then after the beautiness of the of the city, is uh is so beautiful. I think so uh I think that's what I miss the most.
