If I must take uh friend from another country to somewhere in my country uh I prefer take friends to Kyoto because uh Kyoto has a lot of traditional Japanese food and also uh historical temples and statues and even the the friend can experience Japanese traditional tea ceremony, that would be great experience for her. So and also maybe I I want to invite my house to uh my house because she can know uh how we live in Japan. So I take.
