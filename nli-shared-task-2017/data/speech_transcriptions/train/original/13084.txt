One of the most interesting books that I have read recently is Angels and Demons. It is a semi fiction book and I found it very interesting because it uh actually uh touch the daily <%> about the the secret scientific society in Switzerland which was working on antimatter and the mystery that the book revealed was really interesting. Uh there are other factors in the book which uh made me interested in it. They are uh how uh the ancient uh uh churches of Rome and uh and the city of Rome which was clearly explained.
