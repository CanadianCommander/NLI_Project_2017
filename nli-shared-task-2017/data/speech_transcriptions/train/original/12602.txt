Okay, so what I miss most about family uh about my home when I'm away is my family firstly and my friends secondly. My family firstly because I have uh I was raised in a very traditional conservative family where uh each member is very close to the other and uh we used to have a traditions like we meet each Sunday on lunch we uh sometimes we go on a picnic etcetera. So uh I miss family, secondly I miss my friends because I'm a social person, I was used to see my friends, two or three times a week to hang out so that's what I miss my friends and my family when I'm away.
