I like novels most, I like novels more than magazines or poetry and I like them more than the others because um novels are interesting for me. So I can see the story of the persons and the story develops itself and goes on and on. And in magazines we see pictures and stuff like that. And poetry isn't even my types because poetry is too poetic and I it's I just don't like it. So I think novels are the best.
