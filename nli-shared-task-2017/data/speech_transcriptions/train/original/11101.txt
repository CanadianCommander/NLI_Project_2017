The most important opportunity that was given to me was about the idea of going to United States for a period of three months especially in particular in California, San Diego. This opportunity was given to me by my parents who were really concerned about my future and got the opportunity  for me to learn a new language. The opportunity was very important since I lived a really uh important experience that will last in my memory for all of my life. I live in campus and uh I attend an  annu- an American university, and this opportunity is not so common for a lot of people.
