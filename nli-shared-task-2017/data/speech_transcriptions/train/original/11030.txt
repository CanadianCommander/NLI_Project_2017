One of my most wonderful opportunity that I was given was when I was nine. It was to come to United States. I always wanted to be able to talk English and to be able to speak English. And that I came here I am now fluent in English and obtained a second language. My first one is Japanese and um I am as fluent as Japanese in those two languages. And I think that's really good opportunity that other people don't get mostly.
