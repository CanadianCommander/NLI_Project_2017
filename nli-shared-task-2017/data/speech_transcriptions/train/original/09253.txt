The first thing that I would like to talk about is my family of course. I live in Thailand Bangkok and I come France from Brittany exactly. Where I mostly miss my family and my friends especially by the fact that I'm really close to my mother and to my father too. I do not see my brother often, but when I saw see him sorry I'm very close to him too. And we like sharing our time together going to the sea and bird watching. Another thing that I miss a lot is uh one of my best friend, she was all the time with me when I was in France and now I miss her a lot.
