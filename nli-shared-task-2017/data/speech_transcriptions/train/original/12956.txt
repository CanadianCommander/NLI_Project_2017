I usually prefer magazines when I have free time of reading because magazines have words and also pictures then I can visually entertain myself and the pictures which are available in the magazine is easy to understand compared to novels or poetry and the information which comes from visual is much more <%>. So I like to read magazines or I think I say I think I see magazines not even read.
