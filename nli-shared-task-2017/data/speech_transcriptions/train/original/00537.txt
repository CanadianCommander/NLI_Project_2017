The special opportunity given to me was the opportunity to getting to do <%6.5> uni- university in Korea. Uh because I study there and get the interests to the major of law especially international law. So I'm having a chance to get a test to pass the lawyer test. So it was very big opportunities for me to have some direction of my life to be a lawyer.
