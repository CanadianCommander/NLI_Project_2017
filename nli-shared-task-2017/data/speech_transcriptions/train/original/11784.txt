I feel that the most important quality of a person in a group must possess honesty that the remaining members can trust him, a group forms by few members who have some bond between them, the bond requires trust honesty and faith in them. So a person should have honesty he should not lie on any matter, he can share everything with his friends or his group members his or her, and the next quality is that he should be able to communicate the best with all of them, there should not be any communication gap.
