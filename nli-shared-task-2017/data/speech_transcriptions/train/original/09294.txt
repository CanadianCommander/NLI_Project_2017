When I'm far, far away from my home, I mostly chat and miss about my family. Because uh I live them about uh twenty years for now. Thi- which is my whole life nearly. And uh I saw that they are my most valuable things in the world and being so far away from them uh is mi- so miss, makes me homesick and care for them so much. And uh so I, I did my best to get to my home back as soon as possible.
