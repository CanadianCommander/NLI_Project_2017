During my university years one of my professor give me the opportunity, very special opportunity to lead the class about human resources. I uh I decided things, I make them to go some companies to make some research and to collect information about how they, how they manage their human resource and after that collect all the information from all students and uh get another team make a uh book like the, it can be used with school or either school or at companies. It was a good opportunity and good experience for me.
