Got the opportunity to change career and basically to to go to my previous training as a pharmacist. And why it was so important to me it's because actually I had lost my job as a research scientist and without this new opportunity I would have to move out also stayed out from my family and actually it gave me uh, in addition to that, it gave me um a new incentive a new excitement in my life to to <%> to move to a new career which uh was of interest to me and and that's uh I really grab this opportunity and that's why actually you find me here today uh to take this TOEFL to get my license back a pharmacist in Connecticut.
