Okay, a special opportunity for me that was given is that I could study abroad in Barcelona. And um this opportunity, well, this opened to me a new world I met nice people, I um met a new culture okay which which I love very much, I love Spanish. And okay in my opinion it is very important to learn many languages because this is the key to the world and um well I will go to Barcelona again, sure. Yeah, Barcelona is the city to live in and this was the opportunity.
