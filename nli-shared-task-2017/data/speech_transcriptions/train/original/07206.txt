My favorite is Bill Gates' Theory. I love this book because of two reasons. The first reason is the book is comes from his really life and he is tell me how hard I can work and to success in his business. And second reason is he be- because the, uh because the books has some secret uh ideas about his business, about Micro- Mi- Microsoft and and how he can successful in his business.
