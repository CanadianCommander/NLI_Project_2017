If I had to choose a book which was interesting to me I think I would choose an encyclopedia because this deals with very diff- uh diff- very many different topics and you can whenever you like just start or stop reading you can do so and you could choose which passages you read which you're interested and it offers ma- many many important information you can collect from the book and it helps you in conversations when you're new especially as about some topics better you can ta- talk with people about these topics and I think it's very important to read those books.
