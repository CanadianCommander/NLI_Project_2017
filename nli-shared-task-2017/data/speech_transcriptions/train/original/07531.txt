For me the great accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the listening part and that was because I I took notes and sometimes people speak so so fast that it was hard for me to take notes while I'm listening not to miss anything, any part, any important part of what they are saying and it was important to me because it's it seems to be the hardest for me to learn, to listen all the different ways people are speaking.
