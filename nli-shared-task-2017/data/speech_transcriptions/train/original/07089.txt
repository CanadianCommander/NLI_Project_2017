I got a chance to study in the US for my PHD. I think it's a very special opportunity for me because it will expose me to a diff- completely different atmo- like area which  advance the technology. And I'm sure that after completion of my PHD <%25.0> a very good chance for me to get a good job in a multinational company. Not only that uh studying in u- in America gives me an opportunity to meet new people and know new culture. So that I think this is a special opportunity for me.
