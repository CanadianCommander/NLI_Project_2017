I like to read novels in my free time rather than reading magazines or poetry. This is because I like to have a substantial amount of reading so I like a lot of reading. And uh added with this, I like to have interest, continuous interest on reading. Magazines are of a very short time span so you just finish them in a while. I like reading novels because they continue for larger amount of time and your interest is sustained.
