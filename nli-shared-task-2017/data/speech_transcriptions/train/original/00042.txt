I like to read poetry kind of materials in my during my free time because the poetry has a very variety and descripted words and as a singer and as a writer, I it helps a lot me to gain a variety of of vocabulary and the ways to describe any lively things vividly. Also it helps me during the uh writing time in English class. It helps me to write as a figurative language and gain my ability to write very well.
