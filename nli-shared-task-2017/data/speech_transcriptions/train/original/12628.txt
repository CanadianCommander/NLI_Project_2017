The thing I miss the most about my home when I'm away is probably my family and my friends because I think they make a major part of what home is um especially if you're far away. I think being with your friends at home means like remembering good old times and like talking about what's hap- what what has happened recently and then maybe remembering things that you used to do together and then of course coming back to your family is always like a major part of what home is. So I would basically say that my friends and family are most important things that I miss when I'm away from home.
