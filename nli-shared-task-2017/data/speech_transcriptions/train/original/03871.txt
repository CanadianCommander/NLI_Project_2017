I would like to speak about Nineteen Eighty Four uh written by George Orwell because it's a very interesting and amazing uh book. Indeed it is uh, it shows, it is a vision of the future world uh to say it's uh, a fear about the fu- the future because it's explains uh the dictatorship of a big brother and the control of the population and uh how they can be controlled by politics and also by the police without any freedom.
