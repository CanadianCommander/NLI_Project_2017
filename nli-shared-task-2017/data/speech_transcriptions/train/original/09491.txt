The most interesting book that I have read all most of the time is called <%> stories. The it uh it's a book that contains a lot of trues stories that happened to people in real life. It has some funny stories in it, but some which are serious and in a sense of way. One of the stories that I have read which was funny is about a guy who had to spend a night in his friends' house, and his friends actually put glue on his hand and made, and made him tickled his ear and made him slap his face. It is humorous but there are some stories which are not that good in the book. So, so I th- so I think that this book is actually no meant for student who are, yeah especially for children not young adults. Young adults could have enjoyed this.
