I would like to start with my connection um with poetries because I don't like them at all because I think it's a it's a it's um it's heavy to understand and um it's um very very difficult to think about it and so on. I don't need su- such things in my leisure time. Um what I enjoy reading in leisure time is um many things about sports, about motors, about cars and novels because um novels um reading novels um has the ability to to dive away into the scenery, into the action and to um to have fuel <%> time away from the day.
