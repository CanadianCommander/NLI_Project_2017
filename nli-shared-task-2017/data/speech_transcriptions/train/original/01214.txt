The accomplishment that required me to work hardest of all was public speaking as a child. I was very shy. I shied away from adults and from public places where I could be heard. Uh clearly and uh I could not have it in me to speak up when people required me to do so but eventually when I was about eight years old I had to speak in a church recital where I had to read out and recite passages from the Bible. It was at that time I overcame my shyness and it is extremely important and and and a good thing that I did because public speaking is very important.
