Novels and magazines are the uh my favorite reading materials during my free time. For novels because some of the novels that contains the topic or the stories that interest me. It takes a lot of time to read them. Therefore well it's kind of way to waste time but I I like the way it does. And for magazines I can always get a new news from mostly for example like gaming magazines, I can hear about the new games coming up or the <%> uh hardware hard drive functions, it's the way one of the ways that I gather information for my life.
