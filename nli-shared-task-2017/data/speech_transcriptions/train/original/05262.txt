If I had to choose career I would choose a career in physical therapy. Uh I always uh wanted to become a physical therapist as it was my dream. Uh I remember that my uh grandfather he had a stroke and he could not move right side of his body. Um uh we we all what we could do but nothing had it's uh the the physical therapy. Uh a physical therapist used to come to our house to uh treat him every <%> in a day. By seeing him, I was so inspired from that day one I decided that I would be a therapist is future.
