I'm a passionate uh newspaper reader. I'm reading newspaper from my own country from Germany but also from other countries. And what fascinates me about reading those is to contrast the different views on international events. Say uh the look from the French side to events in Germany or from the uh uh the Chinese side on the events on Europe. Um it it shows me, when I read this I understand national responsibilities and as I'm working in an international environment I know what um other people at this moment are uh have on their minds and by what they preoccupied. So that's why I'm a newspaper reader.
