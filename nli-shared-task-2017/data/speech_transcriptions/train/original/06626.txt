As I was young I got this special opportunity to do a round a trip. I got this opportunity because my father gave me enough money to travel. This was very important for me because I think there are not many many people in my age which get the chance to travel around the world and see many different cultures within a few month. This opportunity had a lot of, has had a lot of effort on my decisions afterwards. That's actually this opportunity is actually the course the course I'm her- what I'm here for. As I enjoyed the travel and the different cultures so much, I'm now planning to go back to Australia to study over there.
