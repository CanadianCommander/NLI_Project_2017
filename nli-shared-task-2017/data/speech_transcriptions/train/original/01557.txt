Um the thing I miss most about my home when I'm away is actually mainly uh my favorite food which is mostly not accessible uh in abroad. Also I uh also miss very much my friends and uh for sure going out with them spending time with my family and uh our dog. Another point is hanging out on the river, I really like the neighbors here and the parks uh the parks and the <%> where I used to spend a lot of time my leisure time.
