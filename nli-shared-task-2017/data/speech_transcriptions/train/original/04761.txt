When I'm I'm away from my home, I mostly miss my mom and dad that are really closest to me and um the second thing I mostly miss that is food prepared by my mom and I also miss my brother and sister. I have uh one younger brother and one elder sister. They're really close to me, they are very friendly to me so I miss them most. And uh the thing I miss the most is um my home um that the most comfortable place for me where I feel like to, that I can do anything, anything what I want to do.
