If I could have any job that I wanted I would like to become a <%4.6> engineer because uh it was my childhood dream to work in a fabrication unit where the chips were manufactured. So given a chance I would become a <%16.7> and I would try to join in a fab and see how this chips are really manufactured and how come they are very tiny. And uh at the same time they can uh do a lot of functions like uh micro processing in the computer and uh like a processor in you know mp3 players. So it's really amusing to think about them. So given an opportunity I would surely like to find out inside and uh.
