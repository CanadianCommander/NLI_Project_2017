I was given an opportunity to teach in a very uh well reputated school. Uh this opportunity gave me the ability to uh overcome my stage phobia which I always had and also get introduced to different types of students, and as a mother getting uh being able to uh understand children more and be able to deal uh with their difficulties and to teach them things about life more than uh teaching them. Um uh it also gave me an opportunity to improve because you know improve myself because while I'm teaching I'm leaning as well, I'm in the learning process, so uh I really loved that opportunity.
