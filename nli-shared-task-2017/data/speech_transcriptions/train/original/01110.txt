I think that uh one ability that is valuable to work in a team is uh, uh the ability to organize the work you need to do. Uh this mean that uh you don't, you need uh to be very uh, uh, to understand uh what you need to do inside a team and to do your work in a good way so all the other people of the tea  can use your work. Uh this mean that uh, uh even in very large team uh, you know very well uh the topic where you need to work on and all the people can trust uh that you can do this work in a very good way and in a very effective way that uh can be useful for the whole team.
