Personally, I think the most important quality for a member uh might be to be fair. And the most important thing, because you can't develop somebody uh yes who wants to, want to, who doesn't really work for the team, but uh who just wants to work uh for his own, for his own uh, yes for his own advantage and for his own success and maybe this member might uh yes, might harm you anyway, might uh fail a task also just uh to uh, uh keep, to get his own advantage and I think being fair is the most thing for, uh the most important factor.
