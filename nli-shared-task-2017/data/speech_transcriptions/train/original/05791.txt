When I'm away what I miss most about my home is uh of course the people in my family. That's not the broom because that's just material things but really what I miss is my family, the conversations you can have with them uh to share a life with uh someone and that's when you go away you always take pictures of them. That's because the, you miss them and that's the most important. That's not a bed or that's not a chair or anything else. That's the people, the family, even your friends. That's really important.
