The first thing you can visit there is this beautiful uh uh church that is uh since this is uh has been uh built in the sixteenth century which is really interesting. Another part you can visit is uh the harbor which is a natural one and you can see from there your degrees. Um another aspect you would like to visit uh I would like to show my friend would be um to see an important uh museum, a historical museum.
