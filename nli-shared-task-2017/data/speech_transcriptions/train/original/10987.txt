When I was in the military I got an opportunity to drive a truck as a driver in my camp. I had a license at the time but I was a just a beginner so I couldn't drive well but because of that experience, after then I I can drive well. Actually better than any other of my friends because I drived almost hundred kilometers a day. So it was the best opportunity to drive well for me.
