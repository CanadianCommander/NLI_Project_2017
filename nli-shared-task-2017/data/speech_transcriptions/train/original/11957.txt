If my friends are coming to my country to visit it I will suggest them to visit Paris because I think it's a very beautiful city. They can go and visit monuments such as The Eiffel Tower, or uh Montmartre. They can also go to see very great museum uh such as Louvre or the museum of Modern Arts, they could see things that you can see anywhere else in the world. And and they I think they should visit till um others should go uh the restaurants because of French, French food is really good and I think in Paris you can test everything you want.
