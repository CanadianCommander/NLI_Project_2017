I got a scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service for a semester studying the Arabic language in the, in Cairo. Um I travelled to Cairo a year ago and had a, a semester course at The Arabic Language Center. This was a great opportunity to me because um I had the time to study the Arabic language as uh intensive as I could and uh I could uh I I was able to uh see how um I was able to see culture.
