Since I live alone in Istanbul for my college education I miss my home a lot uh especially the care of my mother and uh my joyful sister. Uh I love her and we have uh ten years between us so I'm her big sister. And uh I love to talk with her, play with her help doing her homework. Uh and the other thing I said is the care of my mother, uh I also miss talking with her whenever I have a problem and I also miss uh her comfort when I'm sick or when I'm lonely or sad.
