The accomplishment I made that I want to explain here is that I organized <%> conference when I was at the college. It was also eight years ago but it still remains very clear and vivid in my mind. I was the chair of the conference and I brought over sixty students from the US and from Japan and let them discuss about issues of Japan and US relationship. It was very important because I learned everything which is necessary to organize things such as funding, networking and setting agenda and also, most importantly, I'm a made great friends through organizing this task.
