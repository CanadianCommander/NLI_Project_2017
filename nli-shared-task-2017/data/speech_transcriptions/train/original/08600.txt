The accomplishment that require my me to work very hard was to get a full score in the <%> test. It was important to me because I wanted to maintain my English skills when I acquired when I lived overseas and also help me retain my self esteem as a person who lived overseas and studied English for long time. And it also help me get into a <%> university. I worked very hard writing on past problems and achieved a full score in the end.
