Uh when I'm away from my home, I esp- I miss my family very much. Especially I miss my mother because uh I've been very close to her since uh my childhood. She has been always there for me and uh she cooks good food for me. Uh and whenever I'm ill she takes care of me. She gives me the medicine. She uh, she helps in reducing the uh, uh fever and other thing. Also when I am in some kind of a conflict, uh she is always there listening. And often she helps me provide uh solution to my problems. I depend her, uh I depend on her very much. She helps me out in my studies and doing my daily routines. So I miss her very much when I'm away from home.
