In my opinion, a valuable member of a team is somebody who is uh first, firstly very reliable. Uh secondly, who knows what the work is all about. Just for example when you're writing  brief, uh, he should know all the legal aspects of this brief we are in a legal field otherwise he would not be very useful for the team and really of the team like leader, a team member should fill the cooperate with the other team members. It makes no sense when it works for he, him alone, not cooperate.
