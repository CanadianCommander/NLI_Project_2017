My French school <%1.7> has given me the opportunity to spend my <%5.5> study in Japan. So I offer a great opportunity to choose uh Japanese university to spend my study and indeed I choose uh, I chose uh Tokyo Institute of Technology to, to complete my study. Uh it's great opportunity since uh Japanese universities are considered to be at the best level on the field of computer science and so I want to accomplish, accomplish a master in computer science on that uh that Japanese university and I think it's the best university I had.
