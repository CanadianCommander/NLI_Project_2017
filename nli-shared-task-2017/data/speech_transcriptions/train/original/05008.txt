An interesting book that I've read was called Harry Potter. It was the interesting book that I have ever read. It's about magical word and different kinds of stuff that you have never seen in your real life. It's about a guy who can use magic since he was born after a magical wizard gave him a scar and it was quite interesting because um it talks about the normal life that you have ever seen and then there's lots of characters and then they give up some fantasy world and you can never respond to it and also they try to tell you about the the world that is in.
