An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was when I had to perform a monologue in my school um for the talent show. This was a great accomplishment for me because I am usually have stage freight and I had to confront the stage freight and learn lines which has always been a difficult task for me. And also experienced ranges of different characters. Um, um I practiced for about three months learning lines and trying to improve characters and my acting abilities and I managed to get up in front of uh six hundred people and performed.
