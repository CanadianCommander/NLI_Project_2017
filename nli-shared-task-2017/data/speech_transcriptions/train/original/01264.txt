Free time whenever I have free time um the material I enjoy the most for reading is like both novels and magazines. I really like reading novels because they show me well I think they are very interesting because they are able to show me like realities um of other parts of the world. And how people and even other parts of the world they are able to to live and to think and surely I also like reading magazines to, I found them very interesting uh to know also how thew world moves in other parts and and how interested things happen.
