The accomplishment that I worked very hard on is the math math grades when I was a graduate when I was a Junior High School student. When I was a child I did not always get a high grades in my math grades and I uh worked very hard and my teacher taught me very seriously and she give and she gave me many special technique to help me to solve my prob- my problem. And uh I got the high grades when I graduate from junior high school and that will allow to apply good school good good new high school. So I think that this achi- this accomplishment is important to me.
