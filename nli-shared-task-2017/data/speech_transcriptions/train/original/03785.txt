If I could choose any one career I would choose that of a physician, and to be precise uh research in physician at uh university. For one I think this career would allow me to do a lot of interesting work that actually benefits people, but also it uh would put me in, in a classroom setting where I get to disseminate the, the knowledge that I've acquired as a physician. And also it uh puts me or it would place me at the frontier of science which I think is very exiting.I expect to be very rewarding, and also I think is an en-devour worth while.
