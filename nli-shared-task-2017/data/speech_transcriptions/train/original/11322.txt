I think it is important to be a person who always listen to another person to become a val- valuable member of a group or a group or team because if person didn't person don't listen anything, it's it means like always individually and then people never consider uh never cooperate with people other people. It's it doesn't make sense, teamwork and anything. The teamwork is always people with people have to work with together. So the people who can listen to other people is uh important.
