The most thing, the most important thing that I would miss when I'm away from home would be my parents. Because my parents are the ones I love the most and I definitely wouldn't be able to do without them. The I don't value anything in my life more than I value my parents and my sister and I would definitely, definitely miss them the most more than anything else at home. My parents, my sister are giving me so much and I wouldn't be able to live without them. Than not live away from from them too long.
