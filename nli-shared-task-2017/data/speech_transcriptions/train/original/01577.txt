The reading material that I prefer to read is are magazines uh because I love magazines I love to see pictures of them and they're updated so I can buy them daily, weekly or monthly. And I can also change it uh with my friends so I don't have to pay a lot for them um so sometimes poetries you know books novels can be boring so buy reading magazines I also spend some time when I sleep and you know I never get bored you can read it in the bus in the at home in the I don't know at the hospital anywhere you can carry now with you so my choice is magazines.
