The thing which I miss the most when I'm not home uh would definitely be the food uh prepared uh in the home uh by my mom because uh is a it tastes great and delicious. When I'm uh staying now back at uh <%> away from home, it's very difficult for me to get accustomed to the food over there. So every time I eat the food I would first let the uh food uh which was cooked by my mom. And secondly, the I would definitely miss the relatives and friends at home uh who uh who are always been a good company to me and I have been a good company to them. So uh it's very difficult uh to stay away from home uh or living uh your friends,your mom, your parents and uh your relatives.
