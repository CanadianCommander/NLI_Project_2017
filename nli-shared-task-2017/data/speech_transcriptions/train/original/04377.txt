I would suggest that the people who have never been to Germany before should visit Berlin because I think Berlin is the most interesting city of Germany. It is very multi cultural, it has a lot of tourist attractions and sites, it has quite a variety of cultures of course. And uh for example the night life is uh unique in Germany. Uh many bars, pubs, theaters and cinemas um yeah exactly and the historic background of Berlin is uh I mean most people know kind of things, but for example the time when Berlin, Berlin was separated or divided into east and west.
