Well, if friends from another country were going to spend time in my country, I would suggest them visiting Rajasthan. Well, Rajasthan is a multi-ethnic and a very towers place. Now the best part about Rajasthan is that uh you can say it's got a number of heritage monuments. It's got a lot of foods, lots of palaces that have been build over a number of years. It's got a lot of desert area as well as a lot of hill area so that um my friends can come by in <%> both of the world uh to to a lot of leisure activity. Well, there is another thing that combines this great place, that is a low cost hotels, that's budget hotels plus they love kites and everything. And that's it about Rajasthan, it's a great place to be.
