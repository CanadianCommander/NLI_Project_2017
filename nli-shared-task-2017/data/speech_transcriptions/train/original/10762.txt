I think the first um important quality a team member has to has is that he must be supportive. Because also if he um is not able to play for example, he must support the others, and he must support the team. And he always has to be there for the team because if one member is missing and the team is in complete, um they cant do anything. And he always has to give his best for the team, because it would be unfair towards the others if he um didn't try to do everything he or she can.
