If a friend from another country who are going to visit my country I think I'm gonna show him or her uh two cities. Basically, the San- Santiago which is the capital of the country because in that city you can find a lot of museum and also you can find uh the government, the building of the government and also uh business neighborhood.

In the city, it's possible to um very beautiful landscape and also uh in that place you can you can practice a lot of uh sport and uh different kind of activity in the uh in the nature.
