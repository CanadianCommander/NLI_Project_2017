Well the book that I read recently was Memoirs of a Geisha and I love it because it talks about a culture that I didn't know a lot and you know the uh the Japanese culture and the Geishas and they show you the arts. I mean the provision of Geisha like an art and not like she is a prostitute and they make a really big difference the prostitute and the Geishas. The Geishas are artists and they, what they do is to entertain people. I like the beauty of the images that the author can see, make you see through the lecture and I'll.
