I would love to become a lawyer for several reason. In the first place uh I think it's a very honorable job because you can defend people uh for example against the criminals. Second I think that uh when you become a lawyer you can earn also a lot of money uh which is good when you live uh in a big cities because life is very expensive. And finally I think that uh to be a lawyer is also really rewarding for you because you made a lot of studies.
