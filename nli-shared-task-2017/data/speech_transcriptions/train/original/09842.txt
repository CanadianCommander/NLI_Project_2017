The stress that I had to go through with the examinations at the end of twelfth grade it was very important cause cause we had to have to get even the high percentage in order to be admitted to a certain college. It required a certain level therefore I had to attain a really high level. If I was not able to. If I was not able to get a certain level up to certain level, I would not be admitted to any college therefore my whole future will be based on this grade.
