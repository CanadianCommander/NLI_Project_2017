Uh what I miss most when I'm away from home is the pampering uh I get from my parents. Uh a specific example would be uh the fact that I live in a hostel for my undergraduate study. Uh I miss the food at home, I miss the sense of discipline that is there at home. In a hostel I have to do everything on my own. Uh of course this gives me a sense of responsibility and it has also made me very mature, but one always misses going home uh after all people have said home sweet home. Um if I go home I know uh I shall be looked after, I shall be cared for um I my parents will do whatever they want uh whatever I want at my beck and call.
