From home, what I miss most about home is my mom, my mom as in my mother and I specifically <%> miss the food she makes and I miss the room I live in. My room is a great place for me to relax and unwind which I'm not able to do when I'm away. I also miss the locality in my home within then all friends here, the park and the people around. So I guess the people and the place makes home a special where you can relax and unwind, and that's what I miss most about it.
