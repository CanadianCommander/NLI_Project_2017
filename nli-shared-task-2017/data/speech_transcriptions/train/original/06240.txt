If friends from another country came to Canada to visit me I would first show them around the <%5.9> since that the city I live in. After that I would take them to Quebec because it's the closest, it's about an hour half drive from <%14.4>. And uh there is a lot of fun things to do in there like go skiing, snowboarding in winter. There is also the hot springs there where you sit in a place like a hot tap that's very warm and nice. After that I'd probably take them to Edmonton because of <%34.2> the galaxy land. Since the rides there are very fun and they have very nice swimming pool there and we'd enjoy ourselves, have a good time.
