Uh there are three things I miss most about my home when I'm away. The first one is uh I was uh, I miss most uh my mum's food. Uh and because they are too delicious and uh I cannot find them in my city. And the second thing is my father's smiling face. Uh I miss my fa- father's smiling face very much when I'm, when I'm away from my home. And um I miss my sister's jokes. Uh because uh sh- she's too uh comic person. And I missed her jokes when I, I'm away from my home. So uh I can say that I miss three things most when I am away from my home.
