Valuable quality or a character that I should uh I think that is valuable for a member in a team is uh equanimity. Equanimity is a character that makes uh the person to be in a mental power in his condition even though he is in a very critical situation. My mother told be that an equanimity person who is having a good equanimity will not go other on others others even though they have uh argued with them and make them make him nerves and uh example uh if you take my situation, I had face very many circumstances where I should argue with others even though I got through the situations with equanimity. So it is a good character.
