An interesting book that uh I read just um months ago is um How To Be Good the author is Nick Hornby. And then it spokes about um an English family that they live in London and I think the um for me the book was really interesting um because I um I just um I can see it uh proper in traditional family and and then I can see the culture of the England people um and there I can learn a lot about this um this um this foreign country this foreign city that is London.
