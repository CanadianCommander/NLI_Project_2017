A special opportunity given to me was um when I was in my sophomore year and I got um a scholarship from University of Wisconsin Madison Medical School to attend a program called NYLF, the National Youth Leadership Forum uh which was related to medicine and give me op- opportunity to see all the problems that occur in medical field and all the options that I have to go into that field. And it was important to me because I wanna pursue my career in going into the medical field and be a doctor or a surgeon. It helped me a lot for making my decision.
