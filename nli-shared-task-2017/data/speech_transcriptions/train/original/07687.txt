I think that the best quality for a member of a team is optimism. I believe that optimism makes you a really a good person for other people who are the member of, of, uh who are in the group with you. They, they can feel you really have always the control of the situation, because you, you, you'd never let them down. And you don't, and you always find a solution to things without uh being, without have, without having the, without being scared. That's all.
