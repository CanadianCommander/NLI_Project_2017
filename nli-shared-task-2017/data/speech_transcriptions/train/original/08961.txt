Well, oh yeah. There is one, uh, uh once when I was studying in Egypt uh my, my undergraduate study uh but uh our professor asked us to do the work on the patients uh like uh more proceeds brought up a <%19.0> we have to do it and we have to do the <%22.1> which is a complete uh, comparison, uh instructions happen to the patients. Uh this was a quite challenging because we have to do the from the, you have to start from the history of the patient and then the <%42.0> and the patients uh requirements.
