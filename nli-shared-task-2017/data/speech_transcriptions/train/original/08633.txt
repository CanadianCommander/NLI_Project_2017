First of all if a friend from another country were going to spend time in my country, uh I would show him my hometown Nice. That's a very beautiful city and there is sea and and there is mountains too. So I will get him in a trip um to see the sea, to spend time in the whole town and everything like that. And after I think um uh we're gonna go to Paris because it's the most beautiful city in the world for me and I would show him uh <%> or Eiffel Tower or everything in Paris because it's so grateful.
