A very great accomplishment for me was for example learning for the TOEFL because at the moment I'm, I'm also working and is both very hard to learn first I am trying uh to learn after I had worked but then this wasn't good, because my concentration was down and that was not a really good benefit. And then I had to do the hard work to learn before work. So I stand up five O'clock in the morning and then learn till, until yeah seven O'clock and then go to work. This was very, very exhausting but I think, I hope it will help for be successful on TOEFL.
