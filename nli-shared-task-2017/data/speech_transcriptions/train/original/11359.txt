Okay, I'm a pilot and once I needed to take a commotion course for a new type of aircraft. The commotion co- course was re- really difficult and uh you had to follow every step that they are taught to you. It was important for me because new type of aircraft was my dream type. I've been always dreaming to flying the aircraft. That was why important for me.
