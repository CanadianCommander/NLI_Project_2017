The qualities that I thinks uh uh a member of a team should have is the uh the mentality to adapt the conditions. Uh I mean to say uh adapt to the environment and with the different persons that he come across in the team. Uh that <%> with the team, within the team. And it's and the other this makes uh him more reliable and more and more conservative with the other team members in the a group and uh and it would be better for everyone to have a good communication with team and they can show these thoughts uh which would uh uh uh required for the team and uh in the team and it would be and I suggest about that is that the nature of adaptability to everything and know everyone.
