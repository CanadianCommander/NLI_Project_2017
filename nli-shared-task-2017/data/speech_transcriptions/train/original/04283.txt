I think is important the <%> team is the were team work and then the team work can make people thinks much more than the person uh uh person or um experience and I mean that um people all together and can uh help to each other and help help each other uh when they are uh figure out one question and that however when you are just alone, that is maybe it's not uh so much idea than the um member. A team work so I think that.
