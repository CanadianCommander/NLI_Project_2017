I had the opportunity to uh be a Erasmus Socrates student and the city um when I will go is Copenhagen. And this is a very good opportunity for me because uh I study cinema and in this city there is um a good university with a very good cinema center. And this opportunity is very important to me because uh I can live uh new international student and above all uh I can improve my English. Um at the same time I think it's good to live in another one city with other people.
