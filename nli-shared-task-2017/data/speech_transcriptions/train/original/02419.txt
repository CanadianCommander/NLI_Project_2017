I think that the most special opportunity that I, I have been given in my life is the uh acceptance of my summer training in a multinational company. Uh this was a very special opportunity for me, because uh the first thing is that it was a very big company so that I found chance to practice very important things, such as seeing important departments of the company. The second and last important thing is that I was paid uh an amount of money because I was making my summer training there and this was an important advantage for me as compared to the other people that make summer training.
