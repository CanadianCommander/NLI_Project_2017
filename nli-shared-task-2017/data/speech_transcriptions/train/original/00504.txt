I feel so good opportunity that was given to me was to, to help uh children with Down Syndrome. I help them to gain confidence with people. I help them to deal with different problems they have. These are people that were abandoned by their families when they were taken from social workers and they were there to be helped from nurses and doctors specialized in that um and I also helped them to.
