Well and uh uh all time favorite of book book mine is uh the <%> uh the reason what why I like this book is uh uh he was a very hardworking man and he was born in a poor family which cannot afford a food, uh daily food also. So he has worked hard to to that extent that he has wrote the constitution of the Indian uh constitution of the India and uh it really inspires me that how a common man can uh grow up uh if if he has a desire to uh to show it uh. So that really inspires me uh when uh uh he has done a lot of uh help to mankind.
