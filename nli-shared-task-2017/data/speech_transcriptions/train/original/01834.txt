Special opportunity that was given me is my father, and my father says I, do you want to go to USA, USA School? And I say y- I don't know. And my father said like you are go to see me to go to USA stay and work. So do you want to go to school? And the next day I said like I don't know but maybe. And one month later I say yes, and that was my the special opportunity because I can go to USA and I am in USA now.
