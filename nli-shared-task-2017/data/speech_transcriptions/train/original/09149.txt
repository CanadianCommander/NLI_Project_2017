Most of the time I'm attracted by fictional novels and poetry such as <%> talking or CSOS. Amelia tried to kill this kinds of writing because we we have one opportunity to explore different worlds. We're allowed to imagine and notice details that are not seen in reality. And uh they're fiction novels we're allowed to create what we imagine which is  one of the things I like fiction the most.
