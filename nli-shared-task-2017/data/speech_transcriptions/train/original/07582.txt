I would recommend them to stay in city of Mumbai. Mumbai is also referred to as the city of dreams. Mumbai has is home to many of the celebrities and hence I would like to recommend my friends to learn from the celebrities and Mumbai also has many uh sightseeing places like the Gateway of India and also many forts and many historical monuments. I would advise my friends to visit all these places and learn more about the Indian culture.
