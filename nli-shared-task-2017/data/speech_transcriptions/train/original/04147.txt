The special opportunity I've received in was to study elementary school in the French school. It's a French school and hence it's very international and um I learn not only from my ca- um my, you know the students there but I also learn from the teachers and we end up getting a very wide cultural knowledge. Um not only that I also learn how to speak French in my school which did no, nothing outside of school helped me to learn French because do I have French family neither did I ever live in, live in France or not French. So it's truly the French school that was an amazing opportunity now I can work in France.
