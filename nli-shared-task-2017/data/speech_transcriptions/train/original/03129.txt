If friends from another country were going to visit me I would certainly show them around my home to- home town just because I think it is a really beautiful city and especially the city center is juts great. Also the architecture is really impressive. And there are quite a lot of things things to do in my home town surprisingly because it is not big of a city. You can go to the theater, to the cinema or you can just go hang around.
