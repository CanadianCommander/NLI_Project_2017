After I got my high school diploma, um I had a , I had a chance to do a volunteer unit in United States. And it was great opportunity for me because um I got the chance to work with homeless people and that was a whole new experience for me. And of course I had a great opportunity to know the language um way better than I learned it in school. So it was probably the greatest opportunity of my life um and, and I got the great opportunity to meet friends um from other countries especially the United States,  but we had also the Spanish people there. So it was multi cultural expi- it was multicultural experience that really was a good thing
