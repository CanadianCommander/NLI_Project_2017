I want to become a doctor because really like helping people and I do a lot of community services and volunteering. I actually volunteer at the hospital and the emergency room and I love it.  Because of that my strong point is biology and math so I think I will be successful in this career and I can be a good doctor. So that is why I want to be a cardiac surgeon. Also I like to spend time in uh hospital, I'm used to having busy schedule and I think I can handle it. Because I can handle the pressure and be successful and at the same time like my job, I would like to become a cardiac surgeon.
