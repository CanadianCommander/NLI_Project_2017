I would choose my own career now and the full time which is nurse and the part time realtor if I were to choose I will still make same cla- same selection because it allows me to serving people. One is more stabilized job and the other one is full of challenging, imagination, creativity. And they both are serving people that's just the part I really like. Um so because as be just nurse the job is not influenced by economic, but as a realtor they are a lot of challenging. But they have potential to make a lot of money. So I think is a good combo for me I still make the same choice.
