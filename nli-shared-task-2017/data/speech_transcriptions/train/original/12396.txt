The things that I uh most miss when uh I am away from my home are my family and uh food and my comforting home. So well, coming from a family that uh we're living with them I am living with them for a long time. So especially my uh sister and uh my grandma they are very uh <%> to me and the foods are also important for me. I like to eat foods of my uh mother and comfort is also important for me. I feel comfortable in my home. Uh that's all.
