I spent one semester in the United States from January two thousand and six until May this uh this year. So I really missed my family and my home town. My family first because um they used to encourage me when I am with this. And uh they really motivate me when, when I am doing something with them, so I really missed them. And also my friends uh because we used to be uh always together and share something, and to visit some nice places and something like that. So I really miss them to and my hometown because I am born there and I miss to some nice places, and I'm always dreaming about um the person I like in the city.
