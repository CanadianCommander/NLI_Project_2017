What I miss about my home when I um away is my relatives. So I miss first my family, my parents and then my friends because when you are away you sometimes you feel a little alone, little lost. And what I also miss when I am away is the food because um French food is very good and I think is also <%> food. There are many vegetables uh fish uh a lot meat and it's quite good.
