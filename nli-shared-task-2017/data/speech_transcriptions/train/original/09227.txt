The book The Red and the Black by Stendhal it's very interesting book in the sense that it reflects romanticism in France in the nineteenth century. What is interesting about this book is how well portrayed the main character, how he manage to rise his social position as any other hero in Frenchman <%> just mimicking Napoleon's attitude.
