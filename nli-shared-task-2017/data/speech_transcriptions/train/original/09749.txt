The most which I is if, if I, if I am away from the home is, is the environment and the family and the garden and the animals which I leave. My room, my friends um which I, who, who are there. And so I, I miss my father uh I am I'm a familiar, I'm a familiar uh man, and so I need the family to, to, to solve the problem or to, I need somebody to, to speak with them and so it's very important for me.
