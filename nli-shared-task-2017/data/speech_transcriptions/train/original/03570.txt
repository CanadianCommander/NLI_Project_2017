Uh normally uh when I leave home uh first uh I will miss about the family relationship because this is most a familial relationship we can have with our family. So uh normally so I missed about those kind of things. Second thing is about food. Uh food is also, uh we are very adjusted about the family food. It's cooked by mother or the cooked by my wife or uh uh family. This is the uh part of our life but then in other place normally we have to find which is the proper food for us. Something like that.
