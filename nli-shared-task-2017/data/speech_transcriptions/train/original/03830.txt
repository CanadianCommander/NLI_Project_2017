A really interesting book I've read uh is Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides. It deals with a guy who is born and people think he's a girl and later in his life he finds out that he in reality is a boy and for me this is a really interesting topic and furthermore it is interestingly narrated. The narrative perspective is from the point of the teller and, of the guy, and he tells the life of his whole family so he also tells parts of his story he can't know, he just knows from things his parents told him and this is really interesting.
