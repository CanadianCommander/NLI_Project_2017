Very interesting book I have read uh the the Buddenbrooks from Thomas Mann um uh first I really like the setting it's in Lubeck um which uh reminds me very much of the Hamburg um the city where I live in. And then second I like the persons in the book. There was this uh Tony <%> and and she she is really like me I think and so uh I really appreciated that. And um finally I think it's very interesting that Thomas Mann uh draw uh directions to his family as he um created the persons uh playing in this book.
