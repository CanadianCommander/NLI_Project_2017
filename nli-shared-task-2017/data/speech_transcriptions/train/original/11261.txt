Accomplishments that I've ever had had was launching a credit card into uh an, into a country. It was one of the first credit cards ever. Uh well it was, because it was new and never done be- previously I was <%17.5> yet uh manageable. Uh it was very hard because of its complexity and because there was no previous experience to relate to. Uh while it was difficult, it was a good challenge yet it was uh it was successfully met. Uh the reason it was very important is it was very important for my career to prove that I can do it even when everybody else thought not and it was a great success.
