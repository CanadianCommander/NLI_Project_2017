If my friends from another country were going to spend time in my country I would uh visit in the major city and visit in the major city in the country such as Seoul, because it has many types of entertainment, and it has many different types of museums or things to see and it will be crowded, in the capital city. In addition there will be more shopping malls that other places like in rural area.
