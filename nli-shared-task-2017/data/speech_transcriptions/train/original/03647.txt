Romance novels it's the best novels for me and it's the most important uh for me actually. Because it's focusing on love uh it's focusing on the relationship between two peoples, that they that love each other uh that will die for each other. And this is the and those novels will focus on the most honest thing in this world and it's and it is the the love. So when somebody love uh love someone else he have to die for him he has to respect him. So this kind of novels will teach us how to treat each other in this world and to know what is love.
