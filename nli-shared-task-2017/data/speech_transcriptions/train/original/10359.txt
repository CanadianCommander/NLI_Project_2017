Staying away from home is really a very hard feeling which you get. And what I miss the most when I remain away from home is the care that I receive from my parents all the time. I don't have to worry for my food. I get my food and all the things at time. And also there is safety at home. And uh what the most I really miss about home, is being with my friends. Uh when I miss my friends the most it's the time when I'm in a real wary or I'm facing some kind of problems. And when you need the friends most and when you miss the. That's what the me is the feeling which you miss of not being at home.
