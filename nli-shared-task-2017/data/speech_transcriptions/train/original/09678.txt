Okay, I read uh Trip Around the World by Mark Twain. I think it was an interesting book because it talks about a different, different adventures he made and I think it's very complete and very exciting. You never want to stop reading about it. So I think uh you just continue continue not like other boo-, books that you just stop reading in one minute. So I think that is why that's one of my favorite books. Uh and well I think that that that's it so uh that I don't have nothing else to say just because it was a very complete book so I think that will be it.
