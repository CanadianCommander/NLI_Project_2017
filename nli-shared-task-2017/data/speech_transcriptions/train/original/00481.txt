I strongly feel that admitting ones take while working in in a group makes someone a valuable member of the team because once you start admitting your mistakes, that with the negative points which your quality or with your uh say work has gotten  to the whole project, the whole module which later is going to be compiled into a project would be effectively characterized and ruled out by the rest of the members. Admitting mistakes also means that you are increasing your reliability. People uh would feel much more uh connected to you and they would also know that you're much more reliable. That's also responsible towards your task.
