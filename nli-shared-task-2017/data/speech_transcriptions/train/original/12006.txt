So when I'm away I I miss my my friends first and also my family when I when I travel. I think it's really important to have friends and family around us to to to get um I know to to so I miss so much my home because when I'm uh I'm home it's it's a personal place where I can I can where I can act uh personally. I can read, I can play <%> I can do whatever I want. So when you're away it's sometime difficult to find all the things uh far away from home.
