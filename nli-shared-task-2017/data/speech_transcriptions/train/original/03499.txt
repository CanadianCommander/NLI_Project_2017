The thing that I work the most hard for uh in my lifetime was some special exams that occur after the two <%> of university in France. Either nationwide exam nationwide exams and you prepare for them during um two years of very intense working uh in science or in lit- literature, I was doing science. And um this is very important because um the rank you get in the exam determines what kind of school you can get in. As I want to be teacher in mathematics I had to be able to get in one of the highest ranked schools. So preparing in these two years was very important as it would determine my possibilities of career uh in mathematics.
