My reading that I most enjoy is a book by an Egyptian writer who is name is Anise Monsoon he's name in the book is around the world in 100 days. This book, this book's about um a vacation about the whole <%> the author. I like this much very much as a person who informative uh book and at the same time I enjoy it again I know about traditions and customs in different count- countries and the whole and some of them are strange and some of them are firm. So I uh say this story help me to again more knowledge and experience.
