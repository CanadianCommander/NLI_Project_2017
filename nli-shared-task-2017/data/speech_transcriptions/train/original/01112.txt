I really like to read a novel uh in free times and because the novels tell me that uh lives of the past, past and uh such as uh Oliver Twist uh written uh which is written them by Dickens. Uh it tell us uh a miserable life of Oliver and I think um that he he's inspire, he lives a terrible life. Um he he lived, he lived in the a low part of the society and uh he was willing to do anything uh to survive and uh and through the novel, I can learn amou- a lot. That's about it.
