I think the in- interesting book I read I have read is Takel Rusty. Takel Rusty is talks about the human who uh will um obey the nature to live in his year uh apes to like everlasting. I think the girl is the leader who um don't want t drink the uh everlasting water to keep l- l- long long life and use the water to save the toad. I think it is really moving and he to- he told us.
