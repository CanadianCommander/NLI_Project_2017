My biggest accomplishment was uh applying for a collage in medicine in the King Saud University and which took me a lot of preparations to do. I had to study a lot of books and a lot of collage medical preps materials and items on it. Um there was a lot of levels or requirements they needed such as interviews and many exams, two or three exams per say. Um I I guess that's all and in the end I was accepted in the college of medicine and that's all.
