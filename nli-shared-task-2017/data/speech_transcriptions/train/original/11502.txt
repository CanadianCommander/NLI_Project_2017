What I miss most when um uh away from my home is uh my parents and my friends. And uh usually when I go away for a long times, uh it's the first thing that I do when I come back to see them and uh have a chat with them. And also I miss the quality of food because I come from France. And um I think the, the food in France are really good. And also I think France has beautiful landscapes. So um it's uh the thing that I missed most uh when I'm uh away from my country; France.
