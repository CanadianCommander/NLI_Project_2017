The first point I would like to make is that I <%> a friend who I wanted to see uh in person. He has a sense of honest. Honest is very important uh capability that you found in any person, your friend or another one to relieve him and deal with him in another directions. People think that honest people have the right to curse and they also have the right to say what they want and they alway uh accepted from people about their ideas, about what they think and that's uh what I refer to.
