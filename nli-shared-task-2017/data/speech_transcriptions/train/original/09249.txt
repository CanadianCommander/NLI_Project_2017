Uh very interesting book I read um last week was uh The Lord of Rings. It has very great story with many characters and there also many figures like <%> or dwarfs and um it it involves very new ideas and uh so it's uh very dangerous. So for example the <%> Gandalf he is a great wizard and very wise and um I like his um behavior because it's not very common to what you can see in the normal world.
