Actually the most important accomplishment in my life was uh to study in IT manage. I have two diploma in IT and I'm planning to uh to complete my study in university. So that was like uh something very not easy to me since I'm working and uh uh the work is like studies is very hard especially here in universities in the United <%> are very expensive. So it's going to cost me a lot of money and a lot of time but I'm going to take this challenge and I need to do stuff because I want to study in university.
