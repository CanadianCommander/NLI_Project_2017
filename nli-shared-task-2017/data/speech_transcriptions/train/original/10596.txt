I think the most important quality for a person to be a valuable member of a group is leaders uh having leader <%> qualities because uh every group needs a leader. Without it the group my have organization problems and uh if there isn't a leader, the group may not achieve its goals although uh the group have the capacity of it. So I think the if a person have the <%> quality of being a leader then it definitely becomes the most valuable member if the group because it will help him or her to be achieve the goal to achieve the goals.
