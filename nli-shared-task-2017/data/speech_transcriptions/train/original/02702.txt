Most of the time I prefer to read about men's health and men's fitness because I start to work a little a little while ago and I need to know what it take what kind of supplements to use and uh how to lift weights, to prepare, to work out, to do the cardio and basically all about the working out and how to use the bench press, how to use the chest press and for arms, for legs, for upper body, for lower body and it's all my hobby.
