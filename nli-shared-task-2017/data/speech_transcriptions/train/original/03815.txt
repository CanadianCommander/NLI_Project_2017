The most interest book I have read till now is the Lord of the Rings. Uh that's because the book completely captivates you from beginning to end. I could not stop even reading about the book once I started. I finish the whole one thousand plus page book in like a week or so. The best part about the book is you can actually imagine the situation. You can, you actually live in that era, you can imagine the uh people who they are potraying, you can imagine how they look, the environment where they're living and everything from the beginning to the end was amazing.
