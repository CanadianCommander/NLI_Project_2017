I m- miss most about my friends when I'm away because I used to live in Taipei and now I moved to Kaohsiung <%> just think that you know to go to a friend's home or to go out with a lot of people, you think that it's nature, it's just everything, everyday text and now um all of my friends uh live in Taipei and uh I live in Kaohsiung, it's hard to find someone to be with. So that's why I miss my friends in Taipei a lot.
