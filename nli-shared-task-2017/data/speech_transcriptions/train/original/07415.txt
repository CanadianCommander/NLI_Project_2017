It's a field that's all the time changing and uh you have to be very audacious to know when to take certain risks and um when to give up. It's very exciting because you all, you, you can be um you're not doing the same thing all the time. You buy a business today and tomorrow you sell it. And then you buy a new one and you are all the time changing in it's got to.
