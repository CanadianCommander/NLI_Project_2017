If my friends from another country came to my country, I would take them to Seoul in San-dong because the ci- the city has a lot of traditional stuff in there. And I like take them to <%17.7> because if they are my friend I'm pretty sure they like shopping and they have a lot of che- cheap and pretty clothes there so I'd like to take them there. And I like to take them to <%34.9> also because that island is very pretty beaut- so I want to show them that pretty sea and have fun there.
