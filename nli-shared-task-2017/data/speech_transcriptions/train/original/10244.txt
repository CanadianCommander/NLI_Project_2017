When I'm not at home I mainly miss my mothers food. It is because I have been so accustomed to to delicious foods she cooks. I do not uh I adjust condition in which food is cooked and the type and which food is cooked outside. Also I miss my family members at home I keep talking and discussing and spend quality time. I also miss my room which is my dearest. Also I in a oral thing I just miss my freedom and doing the things in my own way and also my telephone from which I can speak to my friends and relatives.
