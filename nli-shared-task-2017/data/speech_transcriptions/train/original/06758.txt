What I miss most when um away from home is first of course um my family. Uh as a student I've been uh living uh away from home for now three years and uh and uh I can asses it's very very hard especially at the beginning as a separation with the family. Also the place, places you are familiar with when you're away from them uh tends to to to you tend to miss to miss. Uh for instances, places where you spend you're childhood where you have all your memories or especially yeah yeah, especially intense places. So is very hard to be away from them.
