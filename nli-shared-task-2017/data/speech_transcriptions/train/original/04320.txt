My interesting book I've read is Japanese uh novel that is called <%6.8>. This is the story about a ninja. A ninja tried to kill a shogun and there are, uh there are a lots of action of ninjas but he finally succeed to reach shogun but he didn't kill shogun because uh uh he felt he, this shogun was just a normal man so he didn't kill this. So this kind of action and the way of thought are really fascinated me. That's very interesting.
