One of the most interesting books I have read is called Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I think this book is very important because it uh portrays how society uh used to behave during Jane Austen times and uh we can see how the pride of those families are very important and the prejudice is a feeling which uh concerns uh how people behave uh within the society. This book is very important and I've read it twice in my life.
