In my free time I would like to read novels. Uh because first of all I think novel comes from the real life and is influenced by the real life. So when I'm reading novels I can get to know something about the other world, something about uh other's life so I feel is very interesting. And second I think uh there are some novels that are romantic and fantastic such as loving stories such as novels about family love. They always uh touch me deeply sometimes they make me cry. While I'm reading novels I feel so relaxed so I will choose to read novels.
