The most interesting book I read was The Lord of the Rings because I'm a huge fan of fantasy books and it was a very good book. The storyline was very striking, it was very original. That's why I love the book and it was sorry. Well the book was easy to read and you couldn't let the book go. You just keep reading it and the characters were very strong and appealing and because I'm a computer fan too I love the book.
