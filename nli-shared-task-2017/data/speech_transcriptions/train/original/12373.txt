If my friends were going to my city, I would first receive them in my house and then suggest them to go to the downtown because it is a very nice place where we can find a lot of history about Mexico, not only about <%>. Then there are also very interesting places such as the churches because they also defined a lot of our uh culture and our town. And also I would recommend them to go to night clubs because they are very good right in the city and they can have so much fun over there. The city is a very interesting city so I recommend, I would recommend them to stay here.
