In my free time I like to read novels for one thing because I find them very interesting and um also well you can really get into the story of a novel more because there is um they are longer and so first is there is more information included. Furthermore through novels you can learn about ba- basically life because many novels um draw directly from experiences in life. I also like to read magazines too simply because um it takes less time to read them at times. And plus5 um well they they have more current information as well which can easily be read in a relatively short amount of time and you don't really have to get really into the material or to understand what is going on and happening. And poetry I don't really like to read it too much <%> mainly because it's too abstract so novels would be my main.
