According to me the last book I've read is uh Da Vinci Code written by Dan Brown. Uh I like uh this book because it's uh an active one and because uh there was a lot of suspension into the story. They have a lot of uh personalities that are very uh friendly. And uh I was uh into the story from the beginning to the end. And uh it has also historical references that uh, that are things that uh I like  a lot.
