The book that I found that was interesting when I read uh <%> a long time ago <%>. I remember the author actually but I think that is great. It was the most the the the very very very very interesting thing in this book is that it was like one person. He he didn't know what ha- what's happening until the end of the book and there was a movie about this book actually came in the movies before like one year or two years. In a way this this book was amazing. It was kind of an action and also there was an ideal ideal in this book which was a great experience, really really great book.
