When I when I'm away from home I miss two main things, one is my father, another is my pet Tiger,  a German shepherd dog. My father have gone to uh on leave, father <%> me in my home, my fa- my mother expired about two years back. My father has pushed me a lot and uh then Tiger, he al- he's always playing with me. Uh it is totally dependent on me, that's what I like the most. He uh he always want me to feed him, he always want me to play with him and all that stuff. And the other thing that I miss is my television, whenever I am I get bored I go out.
