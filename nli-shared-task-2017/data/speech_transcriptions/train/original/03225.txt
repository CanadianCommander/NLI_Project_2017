In my opinion uh when you work in team you have to fair. So fairness is uh a valuable quality of someone who is a member. When you're fair you're equal and you treat everyone equal and so uh you're really a success for the group. Um you can uh make many contacts with the other because you always talk the truth and  you're really yeah you're fair about the others because yeah you're telling the truth and you're fair. So you treat the others like you want to be treated. And so yeah you're really a success for the group.
