What I miss most um what I miss most about my home when I'm away um is first of all my house um because in my house I can do whatever I want and I have my own stuff and my own things, personal things. I have my friends and I have my family most uh I have my family. Moreover when I go abroad um um I miss the way of eating in my country and especially the way of eating in my home. Um but anyway uh you you can be able to adapt to any situation. I can I yeah I miss the feeling of staying home.
