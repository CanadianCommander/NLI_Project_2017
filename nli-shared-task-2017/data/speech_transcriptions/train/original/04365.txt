Well, uh my major accomplishment that I had to do uh was uh and the place where I do work very hard was actually my final year of engineering. Uh I know that I hadn't been able to score very well during my uh past three years uh for second and third year. But in the fourth year I was determine to work extremely hard and put my best foot forward. Uh this was needed uh for getting a better job, a better university, uh I have con- convince my oath, which are education. I would not prove my family and the friend that I'm not a <%33.1> guy who actually doesn't uh, who is not a brainy person. But I want to prove the world that hard work and commitment can prove to be very effe- effective for you.
