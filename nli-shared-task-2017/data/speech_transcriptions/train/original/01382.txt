If I'm away from my home I will be miss my home very much. First because my parent when, when I was at home my parents always tell me a lot and I will miss their going after I went away from my home. And my hometown is a very beautiful town. I love being my home town very much there was very much things that I love for the uh, the beautiful places and the place of interest and other museums and something. And if I won't be able to attend to this places I will miss the. So when I'm away from home I will miss my parents and that place of interest in my home town very much.
