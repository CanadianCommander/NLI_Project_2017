What I miss the most when I away from my home uh is my parents. Uh as I am away from home I cannot feel the kindness uh the most kindness that my parents my parents gave me. Perhaps the teachers or my friends provide me but they are not familiar, they are not similar to my parents. Uh second my parents uh provide me uh of course uh money. And it is uh the most important for someone to live. Um so what I miss the most when I am away from home is my parents.
