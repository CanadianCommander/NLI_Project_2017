Uh the job that I would to have but I couldn't is being a soldier. After I finished high school I wanted to join the army in my country back home. However for a spe- specific circumstances uh I couldn't and I I just uh get a scholarship from my country to come to the United States and study here. The reason for that is that my father did not agree that I join the army he didn't want me to be there and he just refused it.
