I think being in the States for a certain period is a huge opportunity for me to achieve some objectives that I've been aiming to complete, and it's been since a while. So um after completing my studies in interpreting and translation, I realized that I had a lot of opportunity opportunities to teach English. And as I'm in the States I'm planning to study English to prepare masters degree in English as second language, which is very important to me.
