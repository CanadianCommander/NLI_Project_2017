I like to read adventurous novels and novels that are filled with suspense and intrigue because they are very interesting to read. For instance, the novel Da Vinci Code was very interesting to me because it was full of puzzles and math- full of mathematical puzzles which I like. And similarly when you have the Sydney Sheldon novels also filled with suspense and intrigue. So I like both adventurous novels as well as novels which are filled with puzzles, which are puzzling and which arouses suspi- suspense in in readers.
