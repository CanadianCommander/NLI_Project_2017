The accomplishment that I worked hard on was to pass my midterm exams when I was seventh grade. Uh the reason why it was hard to pass my midterm exams was because I was sick, because I got the surgery and I had to be in the hospital for a week and that affected a lot in my studies because I had, did not have a lot of time to study and my health was very very bad uh make me to be badly prepare for the test even though I had a lot of time to prepare for it. At the end I got to pass the pass test.
