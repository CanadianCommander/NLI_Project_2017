There are several reasons um that uh um there several reasons uh because of which I, I miss, miss my home when I'm away. Um the first, the first is my friends uh they are important for me, so it's quite hard to be away. My girlfriend of course, same I would like to see my family and I spend a lot of time with them. And my hobbies are related to my hometown, because uh because I play the guitar and orchestra and the music um well I miss the music very much when, when I'm away. Then I like uh Germany as a country, I like um the streets, the security, the feeling of being familiar with everything. Um I like the, the style of architecture and uh I really like the people over there, so that's what I miss when, when I'm away.
