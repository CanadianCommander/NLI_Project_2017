I would suggest them to Zürich because this especially beautiful town with the lake and the hills around it and also because there is uh uh really good orchestra, the Tonhalle Orchestra. Some very interesting feared places and um many restaurants. Yes and they should also go to the Kunsthaus where you can look to many interesting art.
