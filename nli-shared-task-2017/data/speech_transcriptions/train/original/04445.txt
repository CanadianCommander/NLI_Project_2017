This set of qualities describes the quality that I think uh, a member of a team uh should have. I think it's the ability to join in a group and to be a member and a part of a group so that someone can contribute to the work of the team and uh be a, maybe a specialist for a, a special topic or a unit of the work the team performs. Uh and not to be uh, uh leader of the group so that someone uh forces other people to follow their ideas and not uh being as a team.
