I actually do a lot of reading material in my free time. Some of the magazines I enjoy the most are T Three and Mad magazine, these are the onces I read the most. I also enjoy reading fiction and I like reading books on physics and astrophysics. For example uh Steven Hawkins' A brief History of Time, I really enjoyed that book. That's partly because I um I'm planning on I'm planning on choosing a physics as a major and astronomy. Uh I don't enjoy poe- poetry too much but I did enjoy uh The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer and that's about it. I also enjoyed the nineteen eighty four.
