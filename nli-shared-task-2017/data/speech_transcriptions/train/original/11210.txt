In the first year of my college life I really wanted to enter the university soccer team. Otherwise I missed the audition and I couldn't make the team. For that I went to the uh teacher and called, I want to the coach and asked for a favor. That was the only time that I was given a special opportunity. And the coach tried me on my own uh the separate from the team, and I made the team. It was important to me because I really like to, to play soccer and I really want to play for my school team. I play in the uh well first of all when I win match this uh I ha- I have been playing in the first eleven from since then.
