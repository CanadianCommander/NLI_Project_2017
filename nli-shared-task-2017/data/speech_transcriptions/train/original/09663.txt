A special opportunity that was given to me was uh recently in my company. It's a program called SEED, or Sun Enrichment uh Engineer Enrichment uh Development Program. Uh the reasons um uh uh that this opportunity was special to me are quite a few. The first reason is that it let me uh go into an a field which was uh very uh important to me and uh which was highly technical. I enjoyed learning new things in that field. The second reason was that I was assigned a mentor who was an expert in this field and I had a great time interacting with him and learning a lot of new things from him.
