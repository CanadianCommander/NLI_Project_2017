For friends that would like to travel to Costa Rica which is the place I am from, um and because I'll I like to go to the beach as often as I can, I would recommend to visit two cities. One is Guanacaste which is the Pacific Coast. If they are going to travel March between January to March. The beaches is wond- are wonderful and the weather is <%> and very nice. But if they are going to travel between let's say August to November, I would recommend them to go <%> and because the beaches are really near to the forest so they have very uh nice weather and the food there is wonderful.
