I like in my free times and I like to read magazines because of a variety of reasons. For example, one reason is that in magazines there are lot of illustrations and it is nice to look at a picture and don't have so much text. The second reason is that in magazine often uh is gossip is is is told so I can um read nice stories. Furthermore uh most magazines aren't so expensive like uh poetry or books which maybe uh some important sites for a student uh and finally uh magazines aren't very difficult to read. So you can lay back and come down while you are <%> while you are reading the magazine.
