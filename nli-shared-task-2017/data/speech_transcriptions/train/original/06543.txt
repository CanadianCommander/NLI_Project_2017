What I miss most about my home when I'm far away is my family, my brothers and sisters and my parents above the law. They they make me feel confident about what I what I am and also what I miss a lot is my friends because I can I can talk to them and go go to have some things to to eat with them and they they they will have a good really good time when we're all together. And another thing I miss a lot is uh to speaking my own language. I can uh express myself much better than in another language that I know.
