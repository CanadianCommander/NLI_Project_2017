My parents gave me the opportunity to study and to ski in the same time. And I think it is a very important opportunity because when I'm very boring from the study I can go uh skiing in the mountain and uh  I can relaxing. For this reason I want to uh I want to say thank you to my parent because this opportunity can change my behavior and feel me and it feel me better when during my studies.
