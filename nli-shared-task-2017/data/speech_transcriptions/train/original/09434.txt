I think the quality soeone should have who works in a team is that he should take care of the other people. Because um in every team there are sometimes problems and it could be individual problems or problems connected to the task of the team. And and some member of the team can have uh special problem and then who don't care don't see the problem and the whole situation won't be solved. And another reason why there always someone to take care is that um a positive atmosphere is being created and this is also very helpful for the task of the team and the whole situation people work together.
