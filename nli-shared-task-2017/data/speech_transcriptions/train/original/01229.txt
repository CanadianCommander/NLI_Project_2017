Well the opportunity I was given was to study European studies at <%4.9> university where I'm studying now. Because I wanted to go there in first place after my <%10.1> year in Madrid and Spain. But I didn't have the right grade to come in there so went to another university which is, was more far in the north of Germany, and I didn't like it there very much, I didn't like the subject it was cultural studies and it was too theoretic. So I tried it one year later and I did hope to come in and finally I got in. So it was my chance and now I'm very happy with this, because there are a lot of nice people and I like it very much to study there, I like the city and my subject.
