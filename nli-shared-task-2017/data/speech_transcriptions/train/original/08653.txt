Well during my studying time I get the opportunity to, to make an internship in the United States in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for about six months. And this of course was very important for my career because on the one hand I learned or get familiar with the language, so the English language and of course I I learned something about the culture of American people. On the other hand, I I had to work the whole day that means eight hours um on an technical problem which uh was very important moment for the studies. So at the end I had to write an study about it and to end it.
