I am originally from Turkey and if friends from another country were going to spend time in Turkey, I would suggest that they definitely visit Istanbul. I believe Istanbul is an excellent place to visit because it has a very reach history. It combines the East and the West because it was the capital to the Ottoman Empire and it was the capital to the Byzantine Empire. In a way Istanbul also combines the modern and the old. On one hand you can see um some some old churches and the other hand you can see very modern buildings or sky scrapers that are build in more recent times.
