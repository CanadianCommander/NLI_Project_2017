I've read several books. One of these books that I would love to read several times is Harry Potter because, because it has um, it use lots of characters, imaginary and realistic characters. These characters uh defined our, defined our imagine, uh imagine, imaginary brain and the way imaginary people think. And uh it also describe realistic life. Uh this book is one of the most amazing books and uh I would love to repeat it again and to repeat all these books. Although it's uh big and a large book but it's an amazing one.
