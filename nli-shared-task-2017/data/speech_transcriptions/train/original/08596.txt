What I think about a really job for me I think it's something that has to be from to help people actually. I love really helping people around me and also people that are in need you know. I would like to work like in a social place or institution. But not only socially like helping people with disabilities or ageing people or things like that but helping like in another way like bringing like funds or something. Like giving them something else and just material work, material like finance or something. I would like something like maybe to help them.
