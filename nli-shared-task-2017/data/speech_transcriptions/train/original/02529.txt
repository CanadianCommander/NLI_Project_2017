The things that I most miss about um my home when I'm far away it's my mum food. Uh I also used to miss the sea because I live real- really near the sea. And I used to go to walk every morning to the beach. Uh another thing that I also really miss when I'm away is uh the weather because I live in Canary Islands and there is always good weather. So I can go every day to the beach to <%27.8> because it always around twenty five, thirty degrees. So these three things are the things that I most miss from home when I'm away in another country. Um for sure my family this is the thing that I most miss because they help me.
