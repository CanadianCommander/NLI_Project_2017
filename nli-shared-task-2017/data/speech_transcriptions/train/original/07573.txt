An interesting book I've read is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It's about a boy who wants to be free from the formal way of life and leave his home with a couple of friends. They pretty much goes like waking up every morning in his house and escaping from the house to play with his friends and making troubles aside and coming back home late at night to be scorned. Uh I like, I find the book interesting because I found Huck a very interesting character and a familiar character to me.
