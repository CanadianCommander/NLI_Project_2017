When I was away from home the thing I miss mostly it's food. And um it's I'm talking about not food in my home, but also food in my country. I was um, uh living foreign country for three years, I miss food the in, in, in my home country and my home mostly. Because to me I think food it's uh connection between uh a place where I live and uh my memory. By eating food I, I feel like I'm approaching my past in this sense. Food to me it's also have the sense of nostalgia, and uh other than that.
