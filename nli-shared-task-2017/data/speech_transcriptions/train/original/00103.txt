I started to work very hard when I heard about that I can go to Canada for three months with a stipend from the government and this is all uh I wanted to take part in student exchange and for that I had to work hard at school. So for good grades and also for my social experience I need to go to a kindergarten to work with the children, so I had to do a lot of stuff for the student exchange and finally I got the stipend <%39.8> I could go to Canada for three months.
