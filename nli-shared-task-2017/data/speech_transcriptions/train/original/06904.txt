When I'm when I'm away from home, the most thing I miss is the my my <%> accommodation like uh my my room or my my couch and uh other things but usually when I usually live there are things that I misses, uh my friends and I go out with them or uh <%> the the normal place I used to be, I used to go such uh my bar or uh the stadium or <%> like this. I also miss my parents and uh my brother and sister, when I am very conne- connected to them.
