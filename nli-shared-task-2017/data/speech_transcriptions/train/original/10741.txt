Well, first of all uh what I miss most it's my family, my mother, my father and my sister and of course also my dog because I've been with him for eight years now I love him. Uh I also miss a lot my mum's food, it is great. I love it, she cooks really really good. Uh also you know my bed, my room, my personal things that are there. Uh away from home I miss a lot my friends and my boyfriend.
