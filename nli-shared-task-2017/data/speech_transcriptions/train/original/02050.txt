The opportunity was given to me in eleventh grade um when I just uh <%> and so I was in a new atmosphere uh and my teacher helped me to, or asked me to be her teacher assistant in uh, for another class. And so I proved to them you know, who I am and all that since I'm new to school and nobody knows me, so it was a good way for me to um introduce myself and to show people my creative side. And um and it was a good way for, for me to make friends um uh and, and also to uh increase my knowledge about literature as she was, I was a teacher assistant for an English literature teacher in my school.
