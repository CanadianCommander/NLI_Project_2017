When I go abroad, the most things I, I miss is uh, uh Japanese language or uh books uh written by Japanese. Uh for example, when I go to United States uh for the summer vacation, I, I cannot read Japanese character. How, uh always I have to read the English. And the, the very few opportunity to see Japanese character. I really missed the Japanese.
