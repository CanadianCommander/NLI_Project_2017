The most interesting book I must have ever read would obviously be Harry Potter. I have always had a strong fascination for magic and fantasy and it is one of the main reasons why I love this book. In fact, in the book Harry Potter, the main character Harry also is an embodiment of many virtues like bravery, determination and sincerity. And by reading the series it also influences me and teaches me how to instill those virtues in myself. Therefore without doubt the Harry Potter series is uh my favorite books.
