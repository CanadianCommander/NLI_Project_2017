I think um a valuable member of a team will be respectful towards the other members of the team. He will be cooperative with them because you are when you are working as a team, you there are there will be situations when you will be expected to cooperate with each other. And also I think uh the very important uh quality of being a good member of a team will be to be flexible in ideas, not be too rigid about them. One should be open to uh changes so if uh different member of the team has something important to say, you have to listen to it and uh maybe change the way you think about. So according to me being respectful, cooperative and flexible are the important qualities of a good member.
