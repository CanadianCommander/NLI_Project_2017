After fin- finishing high school I got the opportunity to go New Zealand for eight months and to work and to travel around there. The opportunity was given to me by my grandparents and my parents by, by them paying for my flight. Um my time in New Zealand was very important to me because of my experience very different kinds of lifestyles while traveling around and while doing volunteer work at very different places and it was very challenging time because I was by myself and new suggestion and because I had to learn a new language and work was speaking this language.
