I used to be really, really bad at science and my, and then I got to know my mom's friend who is a really good science teacher and I began to study with her. And I, she and I made like a deal that if I get a score over nine, ninety percent on the mid term, uh she would get me a <%27.8> watch. So I studied really, really hard and I got ninety one and I got a really pretty <%34.9> watch.
