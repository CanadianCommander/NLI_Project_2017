I had experience as a volunteer for interpreter in two thousand to world cup. This is a certain accomplishment that required me to work very hard. This is because um as working as a volunteer for interpreter in such a world scaled event, I'm the one who represent our country and that could link to the image or directly linked to the image of our country. That is why I worked so hard to be nice and good to foreigners.
