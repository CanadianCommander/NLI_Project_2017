I if uh if another country people come to spend time in my country then the city which I would suggest are make take them is Delhi. Delhi is the capital city of India. Uh it has the it has many monument, historical monuments and uh uh historical monument like Red Fort, parliament and etcetera. Uh Delhi is also near the Agra. In Agra there is a, the world's best monument Taj Mahal. I would show them and tell them history about that, they really enjoy it. That's it.
