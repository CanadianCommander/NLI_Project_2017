When I'm away from home, I miss the city most, my home city because I'm so used to it. And I really like the Viennese mentality, the coffee shop mentality that when you have nothing to do just sit in the coffee shop with your friends for hours and talk to them and you don't really have that in other cities the same way you have it in Vienna. Another thing I like I I I miss sorry, is my bed because I think my bed is the best bed and it's the only one I can really sleep. And of course my family and my friends because when I'm away from home, they are usually not with me or just small part of them, so I miss talking to them or just being around them.
