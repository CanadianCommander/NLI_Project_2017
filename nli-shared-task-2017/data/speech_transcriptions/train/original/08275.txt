Commanding is one good virtue in a team. Well, each uh, everybody, a number of people will be there in a team, but only the person who commands others and who have clear ideas and have real experience will be the leader. So, in my opinion, the commanding is a good quality in a team. And uh along with this, the person should have the quality of greatness or uh perfection in one field al-, also need uh to know about everything. So commanding is a good quality.
