Well one of the accomplishment that uh required uh hard work for me was the uh credit cards technology I made. Um the reason why it was hard because I needed a lot of resources. So gathering the resources online and offline was hard enough. So uh I needed to check the market and know what products it has. In addition, working in a team was um a bit hard because I was new to that but um I think it was a very enjoyable and exciting uh experiment um and the product was successful.
