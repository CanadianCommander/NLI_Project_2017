An interesting book that I read it was Veronika <%> by Paulo Coelho and I though it was interesting because it talk about a girl who decides to die because she didn't have any interesting things in her life. But after she took the pill she start to realize what the world wasn't and what is involving and what she had to do in it. And she start to have more ideas of uh she was supposed to do and then she rea- she realized that it was better to live than to die. So it shows her the <%> of life.
