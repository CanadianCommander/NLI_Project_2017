Even though I like uh discovering many new things, I must admit that I miss my home when I'm a- when I am away. First because uh I feel very good at home, every I know everything, I'm sure about everything and I have so many, I have so many activities to do there on the in using my every tools, every the TV the computer and everything which is there. I also I am also used to my habits, uh when I hangout in my uh in my room or in the rest of the apartment. But I guess that the thing I miss the most about my ho- when I am away is definitely my family, and all the links we had together, the conversations and the time we can spent all together.
