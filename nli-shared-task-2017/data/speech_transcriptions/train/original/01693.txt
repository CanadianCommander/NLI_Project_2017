The book named Life of <%3.4> inspired me a lot. I have read this book so many times. This book was written by <%14.5>. The reason why I like this book the most because of the way the presentation <%24.1> of this book. The entire life of <%27.8> is mentioned in this. The way he grew up as a king, the con- the consequences that led him to leave the kingdom and to become a saint. The presentation on this is fine.
