In my free time, I like to read materials such as novels. Novels take us to entirely a different world. As such, there are different types of knowledge like some fan- fantasy novels, some other mysteries some detective novels and etcetera etcetera, but coming to the point of fantasy novels, they take us to the land of fantasy. It gives a complete visual. It uh it is a good relation when your mind is completely filled with stress, it helps a lot and uh coming to the more than mystery, when you want to put your mind on nerves, when you want to think properly and solve something, then I feel such types of novels will help us a lot.
