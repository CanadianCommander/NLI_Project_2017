I like the <%> the book <%> The War <%>. Why, because they explain carefully about the purpose of the country's projects in the country, history of the country, politics of the country. Uh about the country, they explain about his front country <%> geographical and his people are <%> to. And then history they say what happened so sad in the country and the politics is how is the literature democratic country or even country.
