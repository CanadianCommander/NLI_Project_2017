When a friend of mine comes from another country to visit my country I would advice him to visit uh first of all the old town. Uh my city is Damascus and uh the old town of Damascus is the oldest uh town in the world that ha been uh populated continuously and uh it is very nice there uh and he can walk in the old <%24.6> and uh buy old things uh hand made by uh locals uh and he can also visit the mosque uh the Umayyad mosque in the centre. Uh I hope the uh the visitor will enjoy as I enjoy it.
