The quality I think that makes someone a ma- a valuable member of the team is the friendly nature of the person. Uh the person needs to understand uh the other members of the team and with his friendly nature he can uh understand the problems of the team, and can explain each other what the situation is going about, and they can uh coolly sort out the problem. Uh the friendly nature is the most important thing uh, a team, a team should have, that makes the member a valuable person in the team since he comes forward in uh any situation to solve the problem.
