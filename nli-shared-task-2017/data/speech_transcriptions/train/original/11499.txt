When I'm away from home and uh there is three things which I miss the most and they are uh family, friends and food. Uh family I miss those three because I think there are three very bio uh subjects that affect my daily and without uh those three uh groups of uh both uh people and something so typical as food you might feel lost in another country. That's why uh uh food doesn't taste the same, family seems far away and uh you feel the need to talk to your friends that's why you miss them.
