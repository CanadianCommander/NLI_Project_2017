Uh if I could have any job or a career I wanted uh I would like to be a teacher. There are two reasons why I think so, uh first of all uh I think that is very meaningful job uh because I can share my experience with my kids and my students, it is very valuable so I like it. And secondly um I think that I like kids so I really like to spend time with kids, for example I have five nephew and niece so I often spend my free time with them. It's kind of fun for my life so with these both reasons I think uh that being a teacher is very uh good thing and uh it's a good job.
