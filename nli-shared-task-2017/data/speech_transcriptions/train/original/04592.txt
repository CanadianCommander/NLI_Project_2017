I like to read on my spare time I love to read magazines. First of all because I've always been told that I can be a model because of my height. So when I read magazines it kind brings you back to I could have been or what I could be someday. I really really like fashion and I see that a lot of magazines give you things of fashion, celebrities and what's going on such as Vogue, People, Allure, Elle uh and all those other magazines really is always about fashion and about all the celebrities. So that's my main reason. The second reason is because I'm very visual and magazines tend to give you a lot of pictures and show you things and um colors.
