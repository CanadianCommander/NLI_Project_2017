I mostly like to read novels and poetry. Um the main reason for that is uh that I especially think these two media are uh most convenient to develop the beauty of language and uh to include deeper meaning so that they are um I will say appropriately um intellectually challenging for me and as well I think that you need a certain uh I will say depth when you read. So I don't want to choose to read for for my entertainment or that entertainment uh I so you might say that I uh should prefer uh poetry over <%>. That's about it thank you.
