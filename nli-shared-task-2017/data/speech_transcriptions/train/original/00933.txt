To start with when I'm out of my homeland the first thing that I'm going to miss is my parents my brother and all my relatives. I will miss the love affection and care they show towards me. The second thing obviously I will be missing is the is my mum's food. The food which my mum prepared for me and the fo- when I go when I go abroad I will obviously miss my native food. I have to adjust to whatever is available over there. Another thing that I will miss over there is friends, friends are those who are very close than parents. You share many things with them which you even can't share with your parents so obviously I'll miss them. You'll also use some freedom because when you stay at your native place you will have some conference about your place and you'll miss it.
