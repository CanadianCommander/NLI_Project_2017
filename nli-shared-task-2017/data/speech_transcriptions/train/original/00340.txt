Thing I miss most about me when I am away is are my parents because I love my parents a lot, especially my mom's home made food because that's the food you won't get outside anywhere in the world. You will miss that food for anything, and I will also miss my father. He's the one of the greatest friends I have and he takes care of me so, and he pampers me a lot so I feel comfortable when I am at home and I also miss my friends. Those my friends which I cherish for life and all the memories I have of my home. I have a dog and who I miss a lot so all these memories make me realize that home is the best place to be when you are away and you cannot be and you cannot ever be away from your home.
