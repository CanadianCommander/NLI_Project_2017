A hard accomplishment I uh, I had to work on very hard was to get to the <%6.0> of law school. Uh this is the university I study on and to get there you have to take uh a written test and oral test and you have to do the TOEFL test, which I did before and had to work hard for that. And in the written test, you have to fulfill questions and uh doing some mathe- maths and something like that. And then uh, in oral test they ask you about  your personal life and why you would like to study law and so on. So you have to be very sure that you would do it and yet you are, that this is what you are gonna do for the all of your life. And uh you ha- also have to have a really good A level to get there, and you have social activities. And so you see.
