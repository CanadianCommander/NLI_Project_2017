I read this book couple of years ago that is called face. Uh it is about a boy who had uh been in an accident uh in a car accident and had his face <%>. Um this um this accident changed his life so he thought his life has ended and everything because of his looks. However when he went into hospital and he saw many other people with larger problems than his um he saw his problem as a smaller one. So it taught that no matter how big my problem was I must think that others are suffering more than I do. Such that inspired me a lot and changed my mind my thoughts.
