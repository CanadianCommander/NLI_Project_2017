If I'm given a choice um about choosing a job I would want to be a flight attendant. Uh the reasons I have is I love traveling and uh I would get to see different cities of the world. At the same time on my trip I'd be able to help people and and give them a comfortable trip. At the same time I'll be working in environment with with people that I like. Also I like the diversity that this job will bring along. I'll be able to meet people from all different, from all different parts of the world.
