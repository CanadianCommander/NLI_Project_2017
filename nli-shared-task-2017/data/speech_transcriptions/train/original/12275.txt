In my free time I like to uh read uh magazines such as Time and and Newsweek uh 'cause uh it gives me uh more information about what's going on, what's going on in the world. Uh it helps me to start up conversations with other people uh um it's it's always a good help uh to know about uh worldly things and social matters when when talking to new people and it helps me out uh when there's really nothing much to talk about. Uh and also, it gi- gi- it gives  me uh more information so that I can get involved in world mat- matters as well.
