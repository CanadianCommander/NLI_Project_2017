What I uh miss most uh about my home when I am away it's uh my room because I really like to be there. I can be there alone, I can do my homework and um I can listen also music, play guitar and uh it's a place where I feel very good. And it's a place that I cannot have the same when I live in another country because uh my room is not the same and the bed also is not the same like it's not so comfortable as mine and uh I don't meet the same friends in my room and I don't have the same picture in the wall and I prefer to live in my room.
