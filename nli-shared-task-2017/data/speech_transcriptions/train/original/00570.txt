The special opportunity that was given to me was the visitation to the US. From the visitation, I learned how to speak English and understand. Also I ha- gained a lot of different friends such as um people from different cultures and even with different taste of sexuality. Also I gained global view from those different friends and English skills. I am now more acceptable to many other cultures and it is more easier to see how the world is running through this global view.
