Well what I miss most about my home is my family first because I have a really big family and all my cousins and aunts and uncles they all live there and I also miss my friends there because they were the friends I had for most of my life. I also miss the kind of culture we have and we the lifestyle we followed um I miss the life and how people are so lively is very different in other countries. Um I miss the food of course it's my favorite and you can't find it anywhere else and I miss our language as well.
