Okay I miss the most uh what I miss the most about my home um is especially my room, um there are my books, my parents, my friends, I have a car at home. Um well especially my friends I am missing here because I have to develop a new um circle of different friends, and um at home I was able to call them to, to yeah share my time with them, to do cool things. And um that's what I'm missing the most I think. Um well that's the kind of social feedback you get if you have your friends, thanks.
