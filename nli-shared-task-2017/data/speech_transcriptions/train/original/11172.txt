The book that I've read uh the Da Vinci Code. I think it was a very good book because I was interested to, to read it and I couldn't stop to read. Uh I re-, I remember was reading for three uh days until I could uh finish the the book. I think it was very good because I found many interesting stories and some description of differences, difference places like France and uh different topics also then I was uh interested in review some information related to the book. Uh sometimes I thought, uh maybe it's too.
