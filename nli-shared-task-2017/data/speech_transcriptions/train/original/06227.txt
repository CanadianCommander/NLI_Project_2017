I miss my mum and dad when I am away from my home. I miss their love and affection, uh but uh I, I receive the same things when uh I convey my message through the telephone or in an email. And I miss the food cooked by my mother which I like uh the most. And I can guide my sister directly in her academic and uh personal life, which uh I think uh should be done by me. But I do this things uh, uh still by emailing her, talking through phones and all. And I miss my pet dog a lot. Uh which I love, love a lot. And I miss uh a lot of time which I spend usually with my friends. So I miss a lot.
