I like to read novels in my free time. First because novels is really enjoyable and my favorite novel is Gone With The Wind. I really enjoy the romantic love story depict by the author. Secondly reading novels is a good way to take my mind off my school work. It's really stressful. However in our reading novel I can immerse myself into the fiction and do not care about the reality. Last but not the least, reading novels can provide some topic for conversation. When I chat with my friends we can communicate our opinion about different novel. It's a good way to enhance the friendship, it's why I like to read novels.
