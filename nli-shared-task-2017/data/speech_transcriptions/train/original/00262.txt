I believe humor is an essential quality for a member of a team. Uh I think it's important it's important because uh talking about something funny or being able to make jokes uh brings people together and make them share something together. Uh it also shows uh some distance and uh might help people to enjoy the moment they spend together. It also helps to fight stress and uh I think that uh humor is essential to a team because it makes people feel that they share something and uh have something in common.
