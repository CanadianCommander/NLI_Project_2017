I've always want to be a pilot because a pilot can travel for, from one city to another so fast and <%9.1> Um also because being a pilot was the wish of my father and I want to make this wish for him because he wants one of his sons to be a pilot. One day I will be I know that, but not now and if I  couldn't be a pilot, I will let my children or my grand children to study navi- navigation to be pilots.
