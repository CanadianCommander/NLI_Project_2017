One of the most interesting boot, books I've read is a book about Heidelberg the city where I, where I study. This books provides a loads of, of a details and it discusses several persons which have played uh an important part in the history or for the history of the, of the city. And also it mentions some major events like the foundation of the university which is really important to Heidelberg in thirteen fifty eight. So this book is really interesting to me because it gives me additional information about city where uh, where I live and I, I really think it's an, a very interesting book.
