The title to the book I, I was uh reading last week was Melodrama. Uh was written by a Colombian writer I don't remember the name but is uh it was a very good book because it reflects all the facts that the Colombians live in Europe and Colombia and mix it with some features about the sex and uh tragic life that the character live on. In the other sense the book was well written because they use a lot of uh characteristic uh, Colombian characteristic of main writing actor Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
