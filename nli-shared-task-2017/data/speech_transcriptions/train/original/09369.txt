A quality to be in a team is that you like to be with different people. You have to be open and you have to talk with those people. You can't be close and doesn't talk to them, because then they won't be with you and they won't <%14.2> you. So, I would say the most uh efficient quality is to be open and to tell them that you are a really nice person and to show them that you are this too.
