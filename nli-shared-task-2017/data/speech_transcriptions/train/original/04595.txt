There is an accomplishment that requires to me me to work very hard is to become uh the foreign student uh to study abroad because it requires a lo- um a very good ability of English. English is the another the second language and it's very important to manage the um uh the languages very well and to go to the foreign lan- uh foreign country and it's very important to know the different culture and uh the different diversities in many other uh countries. So I think this this requires me to work very hard to over the world and I will do it.
