When I'm away from my home what I miss a lot of aspects of the life in my home, but what I missed most is my garden because I have a really big garden and I spend most of my time outside. Because I like uh that they have a lot of trees and um and also my dog. Because I'm play a lot of time with him. He's name is Arturo. And also I miss my room because uh I arranged my room by myself and like it.
