I think one of the quality that makes someone a valuable member of a group or a team is leadership. Because if there is a leadership and then we can decide what to and we can follow what he or she says and leadership can really control people and like teach us what we should do. Like teach us, teach us what to do and my parents and my friends like have leadership and if the teach us what we need to do <%> really helps me learn what I should do in order to succeed in my life. So I think leadership is the most important quality among a member or a team.
