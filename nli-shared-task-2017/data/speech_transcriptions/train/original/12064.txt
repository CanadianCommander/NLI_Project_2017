The most important characteristic in a team is I think affable type people, because affable people can correct information much more than another type of people. And also uh, affable people can do well with another type of people and he, he will be main part of team, so he can uh make cheer for the team member, another team member. And also, affable people uh never give up I think. So, uh affable is the most important characteristics in team. It's over.
