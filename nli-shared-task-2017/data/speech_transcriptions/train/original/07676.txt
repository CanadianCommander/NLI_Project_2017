If I'm away I mostly miss my family especially my sister because my sister is always on a journey on journeys. She is studying in China and she is only very not very often she in Germany. So if I'm if I'm away I miss my whole family so I often miss my dog. He's called flu because he is a very funny dog and I'm also miss the garden at home it's nice to see green garden.
