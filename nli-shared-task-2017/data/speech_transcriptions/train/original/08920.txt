If a friend of mine now who come from another country to visit my country uh I would advice him or her to visit the City of Venice because it's very special city. It's unique in the world and the most important things to notice about Venice are uh the history of the city, very rich and very complex. And the different cultural influences that made Venice what it is now. And moreover shouldn't be, it shouldn't uh forget forgotten. That is uh according to me the most romantic city in the world. So they should they would have a very nice trip, a very nice uh day.
