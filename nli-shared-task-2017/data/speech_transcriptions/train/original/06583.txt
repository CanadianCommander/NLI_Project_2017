Well the uh biggest uh uh achievement uh to now that required me to work very hard was to get my uh masters last year. Uh first because I arrived uh one year, one month, sorry, uh late after everybody so it was a little bit difficult and I had to make up for the classes I mi-, I missed and the other thing is that I didn't have the same background as all the students as I came from another university and I only had uh two years study, one year stu- study in uh commerce and business and the other had four years of study in these subjects because the year before I was uh in my previous degree I was studying Biology so I was not very familiar with the topic.
