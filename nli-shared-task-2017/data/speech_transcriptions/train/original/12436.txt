In there last four years the things I miss most about being away from home are my mom's early morning words to wake me up, my dad's subtle str- words to give me strength when I'm really in trouble and my wor- brother's jokes. Besides them I miss being with my friends, my schoolmates mostly with whom I have spent all my childhood. Besides them I miss  the quietness of my home in the evenings, the loudness of vehicles the rush of the vehicles everything that goes on in a city during the mornings and afternoons and above all I miss the beautiful sea that that is next to my town. I love my city and I miss it most.
