The special opportunity that given to me was to act as a principal of my school for one day. I found that uh very challenging and I fou- I felt that it was a great opportunity because uh I always wanted to do something like that. And it was very exciting but at the same time it was a very challenging and responsible role uh because managing the school, preparing the schedules, uh the examinations, uh looking around at the st- taking care of the students and taking care of the behavior and uh, and uh preparing them as good citizens for the nation is a very big responsibility and I just felt the whole thing for one day. So it was great experience.
