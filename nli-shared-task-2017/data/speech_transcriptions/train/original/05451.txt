Well the accomplishment I would like to talk about is was when I was in my first year in my junior school and I decided to organize a play in my school and I did that I did that mostly for three reasons. First one of course is um is that love theater. The second one is that for three years, I hadn't been able to act or do anything uh that was related to theater because I had to work uh a lot to to be able to enter in the school. And uh the the third reason was it was the only way for me to to be part of a play in the school so it took me a year to organize a play but it was a big success and I'm very proud of it.
