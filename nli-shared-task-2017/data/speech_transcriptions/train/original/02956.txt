In my free time the kind of reading material I prefer most are newspapers. I like all kinds of newspapers ranging from local newspapers to national and international newspapers alike. I find newspapers as an interesting source fo information. So this is the main reasons why I like newspapers you can find every kind of information you want. The second reasons why I think newspapers are particularly relevant to me is that can updated with what's going on in the world and since I'm quite curious person I think that knowing what's going on in the real world is quite relevant to me. Furthermore I like reading newspapers because they offer topics of discussion with my friend.
