My favorite book is The Hound of the Baskervilles written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Well the story re- revolves around the character Sher- Sherlock Holmes and his associate Dr. Watson. Sherlock Holmes is one of the famous detective of all times who solved many cri- criminal stories and and the police to crack many mysteries. The interesting aspect of this story is that how the uh how how a man tries to disguise himself and to acquire the property and it is effectively portrayed and most importantly it is effectively portrayed by the way Sherlock Holmes cracks the mystery.
