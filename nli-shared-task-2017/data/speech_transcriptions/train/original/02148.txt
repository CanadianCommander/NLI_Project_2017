I think the, the most important quality um is thinking and acting uh quickly um because um as you know in a, in a  group all members um you know are there for just may be one or more than one purposes, anyway the most important thing here is to um to decide um what to do and um to finish that project in the in the time um aside from this there are always times that you have to decide quickly and act according to it, if you don't do it your group and you will all both lose everything, I think.
