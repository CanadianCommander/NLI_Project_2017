Home has always been a special place for me to live in because I've always stayed with my parents. Then when I'm away from my parents, the one thing that I miss most is my mum. Uh for example if she's away then I don't know, I don't know what to do in the morning. I, I just wait for the breakfast to come to me, but it doesn't; and I miss her the most. The second thing that I miss is the food, the food that my mum makes. It is so special and so tasty that uh nothing can replace it. Even, even the best I tend to get tired after a  couple of servings, but never with my mum's food. Then the third one that I really love is my dog. My dog has been with, uh with me for a couple of years uh and it has always been with me.
