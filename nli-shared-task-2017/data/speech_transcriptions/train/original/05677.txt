When uh I'm away I miss, of course, the cooking of my mom. She cooks excellent, she's an excellent cook and um our home is close to to to the East sea so I like go for runs, I go for hikes and stuffs so that's what I miss most. And I miss my room of course because it's that's what I like. I mean, the furniture, my bed, my my desk ,my computer everything is there and and I can get the things I want out of the latter what is like nice cookies and stuff. So that that's what I really miss when I'm not at home so and um I miss my my siblings as well, of course. And um uh what I do miss else is um my bicycle because yeah I'm a cyclist <%>.
