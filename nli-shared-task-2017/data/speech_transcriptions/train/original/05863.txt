For me it was very hard to learn those examination first and a certain state <%> explanation in law. It was the first explanation you um that needs or <%> two years of time to prepare and you must learn everyday. For second examination it also took two years to learn. That it is quite a very uh very long time and of course very hard because you got to work. And after that term you must learning what is probably really important to have good explanation because to get a good pay job or job you want to do in the future and so.
