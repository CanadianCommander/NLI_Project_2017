What I miss most when I'm away from home is um are the people um I'm usually spending time with. Like my mum, my brother, my friends. I just miss hanging out with them, having fun, going to the cinema and, and just feeling uh you feel when you're at home. The comfort and um the protection because if you're not at home you're always kind of alone and you have to rely on yourself; what you're doing. Um well and all the things I'm doing with my uh friends, I can't do them when I'm away.
