In my free time I prefer to read magazines. That is better for me because I can find so many topics about my field that is music. For example i can find magazines about song, mixing, music theory and all that kind of things that I prefer to read to improve my knowledge in my own area. The most important thing about uh reading magazines for me is to keep in the same time with other people. Keeping what is new around the world and everything so that's why I prefer to read.
