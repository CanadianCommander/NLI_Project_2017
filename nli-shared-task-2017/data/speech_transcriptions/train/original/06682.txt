When I'm away from my home I miss uh all the comfort that are in my house and because uh when I sit home I could be more quiet and I can do all what I want say uh without uh do any explanation to someone and also because uh in my house there everything what I need to see well and to spend my time in a relaxed way or to invest the same time to study, read or do something that I like to do. That's all.
