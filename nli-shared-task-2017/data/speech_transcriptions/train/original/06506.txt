I will talk about The Pillars of the Earth. Uh this is a book write about uh the construction of a church by a builder and uh the story narrates all all the historical events that uh follow and surround the construction of this church. I like this book because uh it talks back about society and nineteenth century, from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century and there is a very complex drama in it with a lot of characters which are very uh personal and and the author manage to write a lot of details about each character. I would recommend this book.
