Most amazing books I have ever read is not not one book, it's seven book in a row um and it's called the <%>. They are um science fiction but I think they are really amazing because that you you can actually imagine that the things you read in there could actually happen in the future. So the author give you gives you give you um gives you a time line when he where he shows what happens in the history until this time in the future when the action in the books take place and all the technol- technologies and things that are.
