Also will like to become a <%> and although I haven't studied for that, there are many reasons that I why I think I will let you be a doctor. One, I have always wanted uh to help people and all I want is to deal with medicine with the environment of an hospital. Um I haven't become a doctor studying it's uh very big responsibility and I didn't have the courage enough to to become one, but I'm really great.
