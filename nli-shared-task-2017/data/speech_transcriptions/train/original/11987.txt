Singing has always been my passion in life. Uh from the age of ten or so I was fascinated by singing and I always wanted to be a singer when I grew up. So I heard this <%15.3> in school when I was in my tenth class. They had this major singing competition. Uh the, my music teacher train me uh lot for that uh song and I had to work very hard for the f- for performing in the festival. My music teacher had huge expectation on me so I had perform very well. So I worked very hard for that and finally worn the prize in the major competition. That's it.
