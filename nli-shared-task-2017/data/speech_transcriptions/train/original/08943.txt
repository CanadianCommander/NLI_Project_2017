What I miss most about my home when I'm away well is first of all my parents and my sister the members of my family. Obviously they're the most important people in my life, the people who makes my heart most confident and therefore I, the first thing I miss is their company obviously. Especially my sister with whom I normally confide on my on my things and and discuss about things that are tend to be personal. Um other things that I most that I that I miss about being away from home are material things like having plenty of food in the fridge or having my laundry done my mom obviously. This well life is much more comfortable at home.
