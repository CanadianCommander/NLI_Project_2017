If I could choose any job in my career I think I would like to be a manager because as manager I have to communicate with people and I can um use um my friendly way of speaking and solve problems this way. And furthermore uh as a manager you have a good income and um yeah, you have uh many many opportunities for jobs um global or nationwide. So I think that would be the best for me.
