An accomplished that required me to work very hard was to graduate from college. This a compliment accomplishment was important to me because I was able to continue my education in the foreign county, because I got very good grades during my college eduction. I had uh to work very, very hard to get these good grades. And this allowed me to get and internship, um a scholarship for my masters program here in Spain. I think that working hard gives you a reward that you deserve and that you are looking for. And it feels, it makes you feel good about the effort that you have done to gain that, to win that.
