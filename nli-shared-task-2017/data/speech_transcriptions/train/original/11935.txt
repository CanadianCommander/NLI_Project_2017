If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country with me. The place I would suggest that would visit is <%> Island because they can get to see the Indian culture over there and the temples and they can also see how <%> has uh was implemented by the British who were who were who were taken over yeah for a quite a few years. They could see how the British tortured the Indians and them to do their work. Secondly they can also see the water and the lovely beaches which are very unspoiled and and the <%> beauty of the place.
