The last book I have read uh is about uh how a manager can be successful. The name of the book is The One Minute Manager. I think this book uh is very interesting since I'm thinking of applying for an MBA next year. And this book gives uh several examples and illustrates how successful manager uh should be working in a business setting. Uh the text is very simple to read and anyone can understand it with no previous knowledge of any business uh related knowledge.
