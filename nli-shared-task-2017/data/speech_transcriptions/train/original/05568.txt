Um the last interesting book I've read was <%> which is the Perfume um which was written by Patrick Suskind and uh I really liked it because it gave uh actual descriptions of friends of um the renaissance and um all along the book because of the descriptions um of the smells you could actually feel uh like you were there and like you were smelling everything. It's the first time I've experienced that with a book and um really impressed me. Uh I didn't know there were so many things to know about um uh this domain. So it really made me discover um all new things I didn't know about my country and about smells. That's why I really loved it.
