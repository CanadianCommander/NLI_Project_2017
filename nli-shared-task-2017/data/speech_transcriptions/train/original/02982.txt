Uh the most I miss uh away from my home is basically the food which I used to get from my mom, and things like that. Uh home at food uh is something which you'll never get once you leave the home. And with that I miss uh the advice given by my parents and uh the time when you reach home, there is always someone at home. So that, that's the kind of thing which you, I miss when I am away from home. Away from home here it's like having no compassion, but when you are at home, you know there are people to take care about you when you ha- you are down or even by your body language, people can judge what you require. And the kind of support they provide you is really good, the food and the support I really miss living away from home, uh that's it.
