If I got a, a chance to have a job I wanted, I wanted to be either musician or professional producer, because I can play two instruments. I started to play uh piano when I was five, and uh, then when I was ten I started to play guitar so I can play both of them very well now. And I hope uh I think that will help me to be a uh successful musician, and also do some um produce, producing thing in com- a computer now. And I have a lot of compositions.
