Well, uh it's a book called Winter, Winter in the New-, in New York. Uh I unfortunately forgot the name of the author but this story is about uh someone who was a businessman and fall into poverty. So he was poor and drug addict and uh after that he just uh knew that he could rise his life so he became a journalist and came back in the real active life. So he is explaining all about success and how to know about people, to know about yourself. That is why I like this this <%33.3> this this book uh because it make you thinking about who, who you are.
