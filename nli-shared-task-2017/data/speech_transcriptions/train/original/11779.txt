Well first of all I miss my pet uh her name is Sunny uh she's a Pomeranian dog, uh she's very cute. And secondly I miss my family, I have four family members um hence a mother um mother, father, sister and a brother. And um I also miss my computer because I like to play the computer a lot and I have a lot of personal information in there so I I miss the computer a lot because of that. Uh well between these three I think I miss my family the most.
