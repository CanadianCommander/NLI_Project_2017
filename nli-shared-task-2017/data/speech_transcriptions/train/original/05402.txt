The accomplishment that I really would work for is my GRE examination. It was really hard and that I really worked hard because GRE com- comprises of two, two sections. one is quant section another is a verbal section. Quant section which comprises of the analytical part has to be really solved u, using a brain and that I think it really took my, took me a lot of energy and a lot of uh hard work to get, get the desired result. And verbal in other sense is really also tough, difficult because verbal you have many words to learn and many things to grasp and that I think was really, really difficult to grasp and at last I succeeded by working hard for long durations of hours. I think for the, I think GRE was one of the hardest.
