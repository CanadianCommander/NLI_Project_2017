A quality that would make someone a valuable member of a team would be team spirit according to me. To constitute a good member of a team each team member has to have the spirit to work as a part and as an important ingredient of that particular team. Uh and self centric or an ego centric person would not essentially qualify as a good constituent of a team. Team spirit would also lead the team forward and uh victory of a team would eventually be the victory of every person who has worked towards achieving that particular goal for that particular team.
