Well, actually I'm not gonna talk about a book in, in specific but I'm gonna talk about a writer that I like a lot. He's called Dan Brown. I really love Dan Brown's books. I've read uh The Da Vinci Code, uh The <%18.2>, uh Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress. Uh I think this ha- have been great books because they speak uh or they mainly uh talk about mysterious things that happen in real life and real facts. I really love him.
