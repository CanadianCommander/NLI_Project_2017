A special opportunity that was offered in me was playing in the tennis team of my school. This helped me to make up little to gain much confidence. Furthermore, I had made it much fun playing tennis and strong in my constitution and last but not least, it was fun to meet other girls that had the same interests than I had. So that's why playing tennis in the school team was a special opportunity for me in life.
