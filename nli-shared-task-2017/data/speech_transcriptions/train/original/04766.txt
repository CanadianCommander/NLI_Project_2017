I strongly remember reading the book on autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi. I adore him as a person and I liked his principles about Satyagraha which is very important in the present day life. His principles of being dominant and not attacking others help in the present day situation of terrorism, military operations and all certain issues. His life has, his book about the life experiences has influenced me a lot by principles, also principles like getting freedom and fighting towards non-accuracy and uh the illegitimacy of freedom fighting.
