I have to work on a project and <%> at the Indian Institute of Technology as a part of my M-tech project. He asked me to work on seismic data processing and demography. The important part was I need to go learning with Linux first of all. The operating system which has to be used in while uh data processing whatever that I get after or seismic response has been recorded at the broadband data station at <%>. The next part was I need to be very efficient for the results and then compare the results with any standard results which already existed here. I was trying to find out the response of the great Sumatra Earthquake which occurred on twenty six may May two thousand and four and which was recorded at the broadband seismic response station.
