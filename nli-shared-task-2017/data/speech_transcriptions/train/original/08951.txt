The book I'm going to talk about <%> and it's written by <%>. This book talks the condition of Indian youth who are working in call centers in these days. It talks about the state of Indian youth and the plight of Indian youth in this era of development. It gives very interesting details about what a person feels at that particular age and the readers can really relate to the fine details that the author has mentioned in his writings. The reason why I specifically found that book interesting is because it had a lot of facts and a lot of information that is easily seen around, so you could relate to it.
