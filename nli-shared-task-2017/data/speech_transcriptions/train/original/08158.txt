Last summer um my university Dauphine uh had a new summer program for exchanging students from the University of Chicago with students from Paris. And I was very luck y to be taken with uh eighteen other students to go spend five weeks in University of Chicago and discover how studies are made in United States. I was very lucky to be part of that trip because it made me understand how uh education works in other countries and confirm my idea of wanting to spend one year in the United States to uh study or do my third year of university. So I'm really grateful for Dauphine's having, to let me do uh to let me live this experience.
