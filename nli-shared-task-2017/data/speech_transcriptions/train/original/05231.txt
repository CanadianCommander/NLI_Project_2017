I've been presented with the opportunity to go and study to another country. In this case I chose to go to the United States. This is one of the reasons I'm taking this test. And I'm really happy about this opportunity because it's gives me, it gives me the chance to know other people, another culture, to grow, to practice my English, and to learn a lot. So I'm really happy with this opportunity, I'm.
