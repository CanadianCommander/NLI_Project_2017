Uh there are two most things uh that I miss when I'm away from my country which is Japan, one is uh food and the other is my friends. Uh food mainly as a Japanese, I believe uh that food there is excellent. Uh now I live in London, a lot of uh dinning situation has is certainly have been improved but it's is it of no um in <%> very good food city uh that's number one. Uh number two my friends. Uh I have a lot of friends of course back in my home country of Japan. I went through good times, bad times, I talk to them uh and get myself so motivated. That's definitely what I miss today although uh thankfully, we have some email that is provided some complexity.
