The book I recently read was about the history of Italian tradition and cultures and it was very interesting for me because it gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about um cultures, landscapes, especially the south region that I didn't know they even exist. It's the case of Sicily, for example and some small island nearby. Second point is about the food. I had opportunity to see how the food are prepared and they originated like pizza it was originated in Naples. For these main reason I really appreciate this book and I learn a lot from it.
