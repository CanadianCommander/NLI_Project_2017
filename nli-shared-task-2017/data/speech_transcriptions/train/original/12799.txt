It was very hard for me to complete my uh final high school exams uh especially Math because I'm not very good at Math. I had to work very hard, I had to take uh lessons and uh then uh to make it I had uh, I needed a lot of help to do that in order uh to accomplish the whole thing. And at the end I actually made it and uh I was very happy and proud. Yeah, that's it.
