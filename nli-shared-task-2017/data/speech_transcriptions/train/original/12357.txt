Uh the last recent book I've read was the Da Vinci Code because I've always been interested in theology and uh religion stuff. And I like the book because it gives you a lot in a perspective that you are taught to serve as uh educated in a Catholic school and uh it, it usually is a different version about religion from my Catholic education and it also had a lot of action. It was, well, very, very interesting.
