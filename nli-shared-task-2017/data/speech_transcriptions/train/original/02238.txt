According to me if a foreign stude- uh if a foreign visitor comes to my country I would like him to visit my home that is in Jaipur city. This is because he will, he able to know the tradition the culture and the believes of the people and also see the routine life of the people. Because the <%16.9> uh because historical monuments are available at all the uh, uh at all the places as well as in the books the books he can see. But by seeing the monuments he do, he do not know the actual India. To know the actual India the culture the traditions and the believes of the people and how they live help them know more about the country. Moreover the will know our hospitality and our Godly treatment to our guest who come from the other country and how.
