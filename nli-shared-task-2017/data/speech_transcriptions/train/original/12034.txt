I used to work in a bank and because I had uh limited experience, one of my colleagues asked me to do uh certain excel sheet to uh for one of his clients. At first I didn't know what to do, I had to be very accurate, I had to type everything on, on the sheet as he told me to do and thus I had to search for the amounts of uh amount of money has been deposited and uh, uh the dates and uh how much has this client been working for us. So it was a very difficult task and I had to work out for two days and uh what really was important.
