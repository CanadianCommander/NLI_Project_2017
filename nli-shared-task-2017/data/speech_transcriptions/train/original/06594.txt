I think the most interesting book which I have read is by Arindam Chaudhuri, Count Your Chickens Before they Hatch. The reason I like this book is because it's on management and helps me clear my management views. This book tells how to manage a business and how to grow it. The second reason I like this book is because this books tells how you can expand your business. It is very good book for expanding your business.
