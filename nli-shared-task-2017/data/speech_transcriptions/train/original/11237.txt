When I'm away I miss my family and my friends. Um my friends and my family are the most important things for me in the world because they they stand in my back end help me with my problems and when I'm I'm away they cannot help me. Um second thing is second thing is that I'm very interested in in sports and playing football my friends and workmates and and when I'm away I'm my body needs kind of sport to feel well and so on. Another thing is the climate in the region I live in, and it's not very hot and not too cold.
