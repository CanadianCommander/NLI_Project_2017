Of the three reading materials I prefer to read magazines during my free time as there are more information uh available in the magazines especially the business magazines and the science space magazines and also the kind of different magazines whereby the articles available in these uh magazines gives me enough of information which I need to update my daily knowledge other than the various news channels as these generally or sometimes emphasize on various aspects of the uh topics which generally news sometimes uh are not able to provide. So I prefer to read magazines during my free time.
