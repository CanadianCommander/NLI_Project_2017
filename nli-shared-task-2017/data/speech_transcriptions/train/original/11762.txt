Well, um in a team I think one of the most important qualities a person has to have is teamwork as the name suggest. Um le- let me give you an example, for example if you're playing a soccer game and one of your teammates is is not a person who has quality which is teamwork, then he will distract the score of the goals on his on his own. However, if this player, if your friend has the quality um teamwork then he will he will share his ability with you and and he will increase your chance of that one goal winning. So I think that um a team member who has the quality of teamwork will make your team succeed and will um yeah will help your team succeed.
