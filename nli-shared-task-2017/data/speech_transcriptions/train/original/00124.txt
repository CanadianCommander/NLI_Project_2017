One of the best books I ever read is called Bartimaeus by Jonathan Stroud. It is about a demon who comes into our world and the book shows the today's society of the vi- view of the uh demon. The demon called Bartimaeus has a very interesting view of uh humans and its society and it, and he shows how greedy and selfish humans are which in a very funny way which is very interesting to read.
