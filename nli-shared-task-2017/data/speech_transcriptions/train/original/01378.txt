I, I miss many things uh when I'm far from home. Um I think uh one of the most missed things for me uh at home are my books because actually I live far from home right now. And my old books, university books all of them are at home and I don't have many of them uh with me in where I live right now. And secondly I miss um my room to have a separate room.
