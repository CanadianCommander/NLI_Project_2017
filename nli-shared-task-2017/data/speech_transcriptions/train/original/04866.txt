I would suggest my friends coming to visit Germany to visit Cologne first of all. It's a great city on the, located on the Rhine River. Um it has a great his- historical background and a real beautiful beautiful inner city and great night life. Uh except of Cologne, I would suggest to visit <%>. It's a not far from Cologne and it has so many um museums and cultural things to see.
