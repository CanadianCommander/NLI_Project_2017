I truly believe that uh I have given uh huge opportunity when I was able to study. Studying is uh a huge opportunity for me because I, I've been able to do so both home and abroad. And because of many people in my country don't have that opportunity so I, I feel like I, I have to value it as it, as its supposed to and respond to that opportunity by getting as much uh, by learning as much as possible from, from the study. So that's it.
