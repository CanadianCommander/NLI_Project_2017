Of course I would simply advice him to go to Paris because I think uh anybody would have to go to this towm. There are such um many museums and it is uh very important culture, cultural place in France and in Europe. And at the same time I also could uh advice him to go in my town in Lille, it's very convenient to England and to Belgium and also is very also close to Paris. So I can discover a very rich town with very good universities. Uh the college I study there is very good and also many resources and activities in my town.
