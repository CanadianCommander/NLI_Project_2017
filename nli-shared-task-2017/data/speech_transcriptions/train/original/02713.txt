The thing which I miss uh the most when I am uh, when I am far my home is my family, because uh they support me a lot. So when uh I feel alone and when I'm uh, I'm uh, I'm alone or uh in a vacation alone, I miss my family first. And Second I miss my friends and my home simply, so I miss the, the routine I have everyday.
