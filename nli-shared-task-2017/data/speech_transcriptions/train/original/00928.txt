My opportunity was coming to Canada because of my father's work. Um I came here uh two years ago and this wa- this changed my life very much. Uh it, first I think it is very good to uh learn English and I think that uh my English very well. And also uh you can know about other cultures and countries that are cannot be seen if you are living in uh just one place. Um so it was very good experience to go around other countries and see people's.
