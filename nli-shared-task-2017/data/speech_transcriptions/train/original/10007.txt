Okay when I'm not at home, I miss a lot mainly my family because I like to stay with the people that I really like. My friend, my boyfriend is so hard when I have to stay out of home along time. Also one of the things that I miss a lot is the food. I like the food from Spain the typical food. Uh rice, uh vegetable are so healthy here and other thing that I love from my city and my, my house is the weather in general because when you move to colder city I feel sad and I don't feel like I like this place.
