Uh the book I'm going to talk about is Bi- Biography Of Malcom X. Um the reason why I've chosen this book is because he's such um fascinating character especially within the history of the United States. Uh he was the voice of of the black people uh to this this time and he brought major changes and within his autobiography he described himself only a little. So uh thinking about what kind of a person he is makes this book so interesting. Now looking back what I've read, it's just amazing book. That's why I've chosen Malcom X Autobiography.
