An interesting book that I have read is Christmas <%3.9> by Charles Dickens. And the book I thought was interesting because the characters were well planned of and there were not too many characters in the book which made it quite simple and easy to follow. At the same time, at the same time uh each character is well presented and has been well characterized and and uh the book also teaches a model which reflects on the realities of life and which we lear-, which one can learn from in reality too and follow these simple basic rules.
