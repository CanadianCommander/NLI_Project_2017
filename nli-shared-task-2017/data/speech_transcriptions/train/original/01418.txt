Oh, I guess if I could have any job I wanted uh I would be uh a university teacher uh teacher and researcher in linguistics. Actually it has been my plan for several years uh I've been studying a lot of foreign and linguistics for a while. I'm attracted by the intellectual challenge of uh this position. Uh as a researcher, you have to uh always uh invent uh create new ideas. Um this is a challenging, exciting intellectually intellectually. Um I'm also interested by uh the communicative dimension of this job. You always have to uh uh communicate with students, colleagues and uh. Oh, this is it.
