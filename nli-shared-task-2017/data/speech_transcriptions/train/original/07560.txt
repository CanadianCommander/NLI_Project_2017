Indeed I just read a book written by Milan Kundera <%> indeed this book was very interesting for several reasons. The first reasons uh the first reason is that uh the constriction is very original. Uh he wrote several stories which were linked together with things and  not with the history itself. Uh on the second point is that uh the history enters in the composition of the book, it's very interesting
