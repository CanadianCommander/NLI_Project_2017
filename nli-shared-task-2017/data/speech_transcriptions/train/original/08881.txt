The most interesting book I have read is The French Lieutenant Woman uh whose writer is the John Fowles. Uh there are two reasons why I find the book uh very interesting. The first rea- uh the book is uh about uh feminism uh and uh at that times the feminism was a very unrealistic uh approach to the woman because uh the woman had no right uh and therefore it was very interesting. And the second reason is uh it is about uh a very realistic love story uh between a man and woman and the woman uh who wants uh her freedom and the man who wants uh the woman. And uh it, this paradox uh makes the book uh very, very interesting for me and it is very special book for me, French Lieutenant Woman.
