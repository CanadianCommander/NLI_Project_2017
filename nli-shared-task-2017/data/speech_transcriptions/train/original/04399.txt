What I miss most about uh when I'm not at home is uh the comfort of being at home and in uh close, warm uh safe place I should say. Um my mum and my dad they take very good care of my. They prepare meals which are really good compared to what I eat when I'm not at home. Um plus my bed is really comfortable it's uh I think it will be compared to a queen size bed in the US. And um and also less of an adventure than when I'm, I'm out somewhere else traveling or doing something similar to that. And uh well it's always good to come back home after something exciting.
