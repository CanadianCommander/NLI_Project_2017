I would say accomplishment required  too hard is health. Because of health nowadays, you won't be able to do anything right. Health is wealth. Health is very important issue in everybody's life. If you are not healthy mentally, or physically, you won't be able to do whatever you think or whatever you want to do. The main thing that nature expects or the today's world expects from us is health. It doesn't matter if it's child, it's uh men, women or an injured person. Even if you're injured, your health is fine, you're not relying on anybody, you are , you're done. You do need anything else except for your health to work hard.
