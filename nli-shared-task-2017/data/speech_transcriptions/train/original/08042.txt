I would suggest my friends visiting um a capital city like Berlin for example, or any other city, big city like Hamburg uh can visit off in the north and in the south like Munich. I would also suggest to visit my home region Regensburg because it's a very beautiful city with uh an old quarter. Um it has very beautiful surroundings, the landscape is beautiful. You can you have uh uh nice day out in the nature. Um yeah and maybe visit the coast.
