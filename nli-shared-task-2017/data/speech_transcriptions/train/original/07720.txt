When I'm away from home I usually miss three things. Um first of all my girlfriend because uh she has to sit home and she has to work that and um yeah, I really miss her and not being around. The other things, um I do have two cats and um well I miss them as well because they are so dear to me and um yeah, I really miss seeing them. And the other thing is actually my room where I got all my books and all my stuff in it because when I'm away from home I don't access to this books and to all my belongings. So um yeah, those are the three things um I think uh um I miss most when I'm away from home and um there might be other things but um I think these are the three more important one.
