Um uh I su- suggest to visit two two cities in Japan. Uh one is Tokyo. Uh Tokyo is kind of famous in all the whole world and it's kind of many people there and it's the frontier of Japan. And also I suggest to go to Kyoto. Uh Kyoto is many temples and many castles. Um many old kind of Japan stuff is there and many um uh many count- peoples went there before and um and many foreigners are going to there to see the temples and old castles.
