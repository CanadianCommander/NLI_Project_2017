One of the most interesting books I have read was Alchemist. It was about a man looking for a treasure, takes all over the world for his treasure. He goes so many different places and follows some signs about reaching his, his treasure but in the end he finds himself in the place he began. This shows us, this, this gives information about, boo- gives books gives information about where he goes, what he does, how, how he follows the signs and at the end he reaches to conclusion in the, where, in the place he started so it was interesting.
