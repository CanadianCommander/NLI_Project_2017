Well, one of the greatest opportunities I was given in life was to go to the US for grad school for one year as a visiting student. And well it was important because I got to learn more a lot first of all it was a lot of work that I learned a lot. And well I got to meet people from all over the world people that were dealing with the same kind of things, issues that I was dealing with and uh well especially I got to uh, uh to live in an uh in a academy culture that is larger and different from the one I come from, which is really, really you know good experience.
