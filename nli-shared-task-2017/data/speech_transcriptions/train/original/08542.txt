What I miss most about uh about my home when I am away is the comfortness. First I, I cannot, I, I cannot sleep well at outside. And I can make uh a deep sleep in home. And second is the food at home is more su- suited to me. And the food outside doesn't fit well to me. And also it's not delicious. So I feel more comfort, comfortable when I am at home.
