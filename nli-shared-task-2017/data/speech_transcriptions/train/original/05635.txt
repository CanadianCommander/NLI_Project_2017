Well, one accomplishment that required a lot of work for me was my bachelors thesis that I had to write for my studies. I wrote those thesis in English which was quite hard because you have to use a very scientific language and I had to read a lot of English uh papers for for this uh paper. So that was quite hard but I did pretty well in it. Um the paper was pretty important for me because I think it is also very useful for your future profession and the people that you are going to work for they are interested in what you thesis was about and um it is.
