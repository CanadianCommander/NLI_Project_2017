Uh being loyal to a group or a team is I think one of the most important quality of a team member. Uh it's for the, the team work is very important for the team and uh, uh and the members loyalty to the work and both the team is very important. And uh being in a team means to me uh to work as a team, to work in collaboration and cooperation, so being loyal means you both uh have responsibilities towards yourself, towards the work you do and towards, to the other, other team members. So loyalty is uh the most important quality of a team member for me.
