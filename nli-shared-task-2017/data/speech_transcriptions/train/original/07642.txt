Is actually business materials, mostly text books and very topic specific books writing business administration. I also read journals and other types of written materials that are related to business administration. I like this because it is related to the work I do and relates to other of the topics I have studied in my university education in in my previous education. I seldom use novels or poetry as as my preferred kind of reading styles.
