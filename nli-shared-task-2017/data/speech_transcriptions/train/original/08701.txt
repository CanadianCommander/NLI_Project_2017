I miss most of uh my home when I'm away it's um my family, family, because um very close to  my mom and my dad and I like seeing them. And we also have a dog, um  and with the dog um I take walks all the time when I'm at home. That I can do when I'm away also also of course my friends um I don't see them when I'm not at home. So I can't go to discuss something with them and I miss them.
