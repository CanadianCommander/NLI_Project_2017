Um as a Japanese person I would suggest uh friends from another country uh visit the Tokyo Tower for the following reasons. Um Tokyo Tower is the most tallest tower in Japan and away from the top of tower is so place taking spectacular that uh they can enjoy the entire view of the metropolitan city of Tokyo. Not only that, on sunny beautiful days and they see Mount Fuji which is the tallest and most beautiful mountain in Japan. Therefore, they can take good photographs uh from the top of the tower because the top of the mountain is always covered with very beautiful snow throughout the year.
