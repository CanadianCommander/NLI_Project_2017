I always want to be a surgeon in my life and that was mainly because my mama had been through brain cancer, so I knew what it means to loose some one that you really loved. And that was one reason why I wanted to take up surgery in my life. Today's date I am doing surgery and I know that I am doing it for the best good. I've really worked hard for this, I mean I had to study all day and all night and work to my best levels to make sure that I get through the course in surgery. Today I am a surgeon and I know that what I am doing is worth al my efforts and all my sacrifices that I had been making. I had sacrificed all kinds of social life, partying, sports, everything and just concentrated on my studies to make sure I crack entrance exam and to make a way for myself.
