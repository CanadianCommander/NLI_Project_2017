Uh if I could have any job or career I think I would choose uh being a pilot uh because uh first I can travel around the world and and it would really broaden my my horizons and that would be benefit to much of your life. And second is that uh I can face different people and learn different culture uh which I'm very interested in because I love communication and I want to talk to different people uh it will make me happy. I love talking, I love communicating and it will enrich my experience in life.
