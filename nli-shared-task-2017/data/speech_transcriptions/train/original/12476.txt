When my father was a little boy, he didn't have any money, you know. He wasn't able to go to school, he had to work so he can bring some money to his house. So, I think the the opportunity that I have is important because I got the chance of studying, I got the chance of going to the university, I got the chance to travel, I got the chance to speak another language, well, I mean, if you if you make me pass. And I think that that was the opportunity more important that I had.
