If friends from another country would uh come and spend time in my country I would probably advice them to visit Shalom the capital of uh the cap- the capital city of my state. Shalom is a beautiful hill station and uh with pleasant climate through out the year. It is has a lot of natural beauty with it surrounded by almost seven to eight water falls, uh and su- surrounded by almost seven to eight waterfalls. Then a short drive away from Shalom <%30.0> one of the most, the most wetest places on earth. It has a good scenery <%35.3> with many caves and water falls and that would make for a very pleasant trip for those who love nature.
