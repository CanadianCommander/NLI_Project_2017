Uh I think the most uh valuable quality that a member should have to be a member of a team is his quality to go on well with other team members. Somebody might uh might contest that and say that the most important uh quality of a group member should be uh his the ability of his to contribute to the group but that's not true. Somebody like who has the ability to carry out to take the group with him even if he like is not that skill. But the but he contribute to the entire environment and carry the team with him. So the team would actually accomplish in doing more or that's all thank you.
