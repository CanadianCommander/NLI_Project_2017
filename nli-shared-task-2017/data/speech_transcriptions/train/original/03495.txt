There are a lot of things that I miss when I'm away from my home. The first uh thing that I miss is my parents' affection that is blended with a kind of discipline because right from my childhood I've been taught many things from my parents. And the second thing that I miss is uh my brother's uh great sense of humor because uh whenever we're around chatting my brothers used to just um prank a lot of things. So and so all these uh stuff I miss when I'm away from home. And third uh and the most important thing that I miss uh is my mom's cuisines. I really love my mom's uh uh uh delicious food items so so.
