The most interesting book that I have read was The Power of One. Firstly, because it was knowledgeable. Because the story was about the environment and the biggest issue of the South Africa which was apartheid. They gave me a good knowledge of South Africa behind story and their history. Secondly, it was entertaining. It not only talked about the history but it also talked about the entertaining aspects such as boxing and I could guess and imagine what the story of the next chapter was going to be and I was anxious about the following story. And I could dream about if I was the main character of the story, how it would be so nice. For these reasons, I personally prefer this book.
