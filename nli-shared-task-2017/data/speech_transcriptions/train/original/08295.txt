I like the poetry best, <%> is is that usually poetry is short to read so um I'm in reading in the break time during school time or working time and yeah yay I might have flexible schedule to read it. The second reason for this is that I may I mime and a lot with my friends about poem and uh always different analysis with my friends so I contract my opinion, his opinion and it involves more fun of that poem. I I feel I feel real refreshed when I'm after I read poem that's all about it.
