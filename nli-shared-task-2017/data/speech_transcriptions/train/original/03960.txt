What I miss the most is my time when I go out, like hang out with my friends I can kind of ma- manage my time by myself. I have to inform my friends. I have to hear what friends, my friends want to do and I can come up the what I want to do. But when I'm in my home I can can do whatever my, whatever I want to do. I ca- can lie on the bed and watching TV and listening to music, read books, read novels or, or uh maybe read magazines and I can can relax and I can manage my time so that is what I miss the most.
