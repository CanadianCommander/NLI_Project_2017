I think that one of the best quality that a person a valuable member of the team should have is capacity of knowledge transfer. In fact I think that when a person is able to transfer the information he knows in a very clear way it's easier for people uh understand uh what the person is saying. This clear way of transferring information accelerates the time that people have need for unders- to understand them what the person convey when they're speaking.
