The book I read was uh the Perfume. I really like this book, uh it is very emotional. Uh what I like about it is that it is related to true history uh that happened in a setting that was u totally uh fiction. The main character is kind of an anti-hero. What is very uh uh <%> for this character. Um what I like the most about the book is the the drama and the development that he takes from the beginning to the end.
