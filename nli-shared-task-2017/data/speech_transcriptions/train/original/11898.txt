I think the best quality a group member or a team member should have is leadership because admi- uh group needs to direct it or someone to take charge and be the one responsible for the group decisions. Also uh a good leader is someone that uh that cares for the group and he or she will look at look after each of the group members to take him to the goals or the all the objectives the group already has chosen.
