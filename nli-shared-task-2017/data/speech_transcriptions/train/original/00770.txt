About my home is always my parents, and relatives and friends. There are various reasons behind this, first thing whenever I go away from my home I feel the feeling of home sickness. And I was used to be with my friends in my childhood or my school time. After I leave home just due to because of it maybe because of studies or else it maybe because of some project, I miss them a lot because I was habituated to be with everyone surrounded by me surrounded to me or of course then our home. So mostly I can't leave this and mostly I miss my parents and my friends. That's it of course.
