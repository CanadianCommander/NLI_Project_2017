Special opportunity that I was given was when I was at, at college and my teacher asked me to help the old pe-. It was a great opportunity for me because I get to, I got to know so many people, old people over there who were suffering from serious diseases. Help- I talked to them this helped them relieve their pain, their tension. After talking to them I made them feel happy because they have no one to talk to since they're old people, they are sick people, their family has deserted them so I was really happy that I could talk to them and to meet them and I could help them relieve a little bit of tension, a little bit of pain that they had in their life. So I think um i- it was a great opportunity for me you know, getting to know old people help them, that's it yeah, thank you.
