The reading material I read most uh are novels. Um I like novels because they're kind of kind of magic. I got so much into them and I usually like uh taking the part of one of the characters. I like them because they are based mostly on fantasy and uh how the author invent stuff and uh is able to write them down. I like be a writer too in my future. So I really like um reading them to get ideas and stuff and uh to um accurate my fantasy.
