The two things I miss most is my bed um very comfortable bed with a hard mattress, and I know very good how to sleep in it, I'm very used to that. And the second thing I miss most is uh the food, the food uh the usual cereals that I take in the morning, with so- some excellent foods from the market nearby. And um uh the well calibrated food uh that we cook for launch and dinner. So it's something light and refreshing that I'm not being served when I'm not at home. And these two is which I miss most.
