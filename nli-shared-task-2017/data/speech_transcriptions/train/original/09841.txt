Five years ago, my father asked uh the family to follow him in the United States. And at first I thought that it was not a good idea and I was afraid of, of that, but I thought about it and I think that it's good for me um for my, about my studies, uh about better job, it's always good to have <%> foreign language. And it helped me to be more open minded to the world and maybe to grow up and to, to be able to have any job I want and, and because I want to be an auctioneer so it was good.
