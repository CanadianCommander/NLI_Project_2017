Uh the most interest book I've read is in Physics who's title is uh The Quantum Physics by R- Robert Resnick and Eisberg and I, I liked it uh, I liked it very much because the the way it is being discussed, the discussion is coherent, very coherent, uh it's logically organized and for each and every topic the prerequisites are explained with, with clarity. They were crisp at the same time they are crisp that is uh they have not deviated from the focus. And moreover, another appreciable reason uh of uh actually admiring that book is the way they have presented, the way they have taken from the details of known to unknown for an advanced graduate student and its applications.
