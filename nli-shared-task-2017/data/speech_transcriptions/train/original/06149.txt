Do, if I had to choose a job or a career I think I would like to be a manager in the research of development departments, um in a technical field. Uh the reason being is um first of all I'd like to, I have been working um in research for some time now, and I'd like to work on something more applied, and that's my uh my ultimate for choosing research and development, and most likely development part of it is more interesting to me. Why managing is I think I do have leadership skills, uh because I have uh supervised uh students before and um uh I am very optimized person, I am very much goal oriented, and uh I can see the big picture of things, as far as I can uh, I can say it therefore are my choice for this job.
