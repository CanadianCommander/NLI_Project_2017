One of the achievements I remembered that I worked really hard it was when I participated in a mock court organized by the college. It lot of established mode of participating in this competition and I was relatively new. I wasn't sure how to go about uh, it was <%15.6> I was participating in a <%18.1> court and lot of people thought I wouldn't be able to it to the final five but in the end I did. But it required me to work really hard and it was very important for me to show those people I can do it. So I think this accomplishment is one think I really remember because I have to work really hard and I prove lot of people who did not have any expectation for me wrong. And I think this is one accomplishment I always forever and ever remember. Thank you.
