I like to read novels because they are relaxing um once get also out of the reality and it's just straight forward and soon as I start I know exactly how it ends and and I need to to think when I'm reading it and it's quite hopeful from to get out of the um reality, the daily activities and the whole stress one has work and sometimes school, keep away from family matters and things like that. So it's that's my favorite thing I do when I'm free unless I go out and sit besides water and just um fear wind pointing at me.
