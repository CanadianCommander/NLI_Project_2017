I had to work very hard when I did my audition for <%> in London. It meant to me to learn in English two roles, I meant two characters two monologues. So it was very challenging to me to read in English then act in English and then have an addition to act in front of. So now I feel like proud about that opportunity that I gave to myself to be in front of these auditions and the there's uh and made these monologues in Engl- in English. So this is what I did and this experience took me a very hard work.
