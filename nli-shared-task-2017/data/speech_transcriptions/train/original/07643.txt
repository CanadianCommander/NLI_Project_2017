Well I uh most miss my family and my parents especially because I was always able to um come to them when I had any problems and could talk to them. They always <%> me me their ears and um I could talk to them uh about my studies too. So everything that um was important to me I could um uh tell them and they uh gave me advice and help me to uh through some struggles and things like that and I miss that when I'm away. Uh like now when I was when I moved away.
