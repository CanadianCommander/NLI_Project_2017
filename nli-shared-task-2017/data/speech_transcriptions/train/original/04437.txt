Well, actually a couple of my friends from Poland came last year and um I took them to a lot of restaurants which I like. We also visit the Museum of Botero which is one of the best museums here in the city in Bogotá, Columbia. I'd also uh I did also took them to the pubs and we drank some beers which we all like. Um I took them to the public library which is like an important place in the city. Uh we also went to to amusement parks uh and we had a great time there. If they come back of uh or if some of the friends came, I would take.
