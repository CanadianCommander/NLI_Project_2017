I got the opportunity to meet director at the human resources apartment at the First Seasons hotel West Lake village. It was a very special opportunity for me because it gave me the time to talk to him and introduce myself. Now I'm going to be able to work at the first seasons hotel as a <%21.6> starting at the end of the month of November. This is something I always wanted to do that's why I consider it as special opportunity to work. And a hotel that is such big and important in the whole world that is First Seasons.
