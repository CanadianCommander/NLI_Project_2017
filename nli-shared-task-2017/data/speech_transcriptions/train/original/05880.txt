Uh the thing that I miss the most when I'm going away is friends and my family. Because I have a big family. And I'm, I'm, I don't like to be alone. I like to be with a lot of people. And I think it very important to be around with friends and family. The second thing that I miss the most is my training because uh in Paris I did, I do, I used to do a lot of dance, uh ballet dance and when uh I am away, I can, I can't practice my ballet. And I miss me, I miss it a lot.
