The book I have read is called News of a <%2.5> Kidnapping and is written by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It combines many elements that make it an extremely good book. It combines the element of mystery, it combines the elements of description of Colombia living through one of the hard, of its hardest times during the, the war against Medellin Drug Cartel and one of the characteristics that has most impressed me is his very news-like approach. It's bas-, basically a reportage, the story is obv- obviously inspired by uh facts that have actually occurred but in particular it is re-exposed.
