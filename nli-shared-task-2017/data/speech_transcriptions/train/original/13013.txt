If a could choose um my career like having just one wish, I would like I would love to become a wine maker since this is a job um where you can be very creative if you're in a small wine actually. You can work hands on, you can work um based on your knowledge you obtained. I am a food scientist so I can go back to my scientific knowledge and combine these two like the the hands on work and um what I what I studied. Yeah you can uh actually when you work at a small wine you can be very creative and become kind of an art.
