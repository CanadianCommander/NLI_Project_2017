Well now I live in Tokyo now um away from my own home. My real home is in Shizouka. And at my real home, I have two birds; their names Kong and Hakou and I really miss them in Tokyo now. Um they are usually in cage, but um when I take them out from this cage, they are very um familiar to me and fly to my shoulders and head. And they are very cute. So I want to meet them very much. I miss them very much.
