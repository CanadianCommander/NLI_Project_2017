Uh on of the things I missed most when I'm away is for example my room which represents the the place where I spent most time during my day because I used to study in there. I also used to read and talk to friends while I'm at home, so I really liked that place in in my house then um I really miss the culture because being in another nation or country uh forces you to eat other kinds of foods that you are not used to. So for example is somehow I have been to the states and I had to to eat different meals <%> ones. And then I really miss my dog which lives in my house.
