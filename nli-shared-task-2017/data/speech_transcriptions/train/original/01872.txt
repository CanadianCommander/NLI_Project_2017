I choose to complete my study, because if I thinks about my career, that mean I thinks about to improve my education, to get higher education. Because you know when I get my job okay I'll be in same level. But if I improve my career and improve my education that mean I improve my uh opportunity to get high level of uh job or a position in my job. That mean same, if uh same that advice as if you ha- if you give me a- if you give me fish I will it it one day, but if you teach me how I i fish how I fishing I will eat every day. That mean its better for me I improve myself to get higher job and that I have opportunity to prove.
