In my opinion a very important quality in order to be um qualified for working in a team, is to respect the other members and this can be expressed in different ways. Um it is very important um to not to make fun of somebody, and not to make fun of their work. Furthermore, also is important not to be lazy, and um yeah not to work and try to get the benefits um from the others work. So um because the whole team work just is created for something. So it's really important to respect the others and their work.
