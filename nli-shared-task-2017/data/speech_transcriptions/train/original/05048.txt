One of the books that I read that I love the most was the play of Macbeth. Uh this play is about a man uh that he, he is encounter with some witches that they predict what may happen to, on his future and because of the ambitions and because of the, of his uh blindness to the reality he commits some uh sins, some murders for example that leads him to the predictions that the witches made. Uh that is why this book I have, uh the way this novel is play I really do like the most.
