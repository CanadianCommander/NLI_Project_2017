At my point of view I prefer reading the newspaper, that's because with some news, first it give me variety with the topics so I carry the novels and uh poetry and uh anything inside the newspaper. The second thing and the most important it gives me that, it gives me the news, the latest news around the world and all updated inside my city and inside my country and inside all the world. And also it's available and it has a daily update. Also it's cheaper so that's why I prefer newspaper.
