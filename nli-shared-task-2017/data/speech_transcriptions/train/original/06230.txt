If my friends were to come my country South Korea to visit, I will suggest they visit Seoul the capital city because Seoul is pretty much where everything happens. It's very economical and political section of the country and there is a lot of old places where you can visit like palaces and old castles and stuff. And there is also a lot of fun things to do such as um in the night there is a lot of entertaining places that you can visit and experience the Korean culture and the Korean people.
