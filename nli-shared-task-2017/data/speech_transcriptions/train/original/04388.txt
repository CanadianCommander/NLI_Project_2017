If any of my friends from around were going to spend time in my country I'd suggest them to visit Madrid. There are many reasons for that but the main ones is the variety of <%> activities. Um on one hand, we have museums place all over the year um the one that is very important and is really good too and restaurant <%> points. There are many many restaurants and bars where you can have that tapas that is a variety of culinary food here. And you can uh literally travel through the food and beverage at the same time that you enjoy many places.
