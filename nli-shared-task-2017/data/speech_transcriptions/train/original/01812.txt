A special opportunity I was given is uh my current job uh for the Mexican consulate. Even since I was um a little girl I knew I wanted to, to travel and work in an international environment. And I, I studied really hard for me to accomplish that um I moved to San Francisco and I met some people from the consulate and they gave me the opportunity to come and work for, for Mexico um as a government official. It's um, it's helped me greatly because um I pursuing a career on the international management and having that, that background that um job background is really good for my resume.
