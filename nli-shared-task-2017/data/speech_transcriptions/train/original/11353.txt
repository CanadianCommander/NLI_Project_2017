The accomplishment for which I had to work really hard was entering the Institu- Indian Institute of Technology Delhi through the Joint En- Entrance Exam. It required two years of very hard work and preparation in class eleven and twelve and when I entered this exam, it mentored me because it meant that all my hard work had paid off. And in fa- in fact my future was in a way secure because after doing graduation from IT Delhi, the jobs that you get are reasonably paying and you can even pursue further research in the areas of my interest like Computer Science and and Graphics. So in a way entering IT Delhi was an accomplishment which was really important for my life and for which I had to work really hard and uh this has basically guaranteed me a better future.
