I think that leadership is the most important quality for a team or group member to have. For example, I'm in a tennis team right now and I am a leader of the team and I think people choose me because I have a great leadership and I'm proud of it and I expecting other people to have a similar quality and I'm sure that everybody is responsibility and um and quality for the team to win are the most important with a team.
