I miss most about uh my mom's food because uh I love her food and her cook is really good and I grew up uh with her uh food. So uh for example there she made beautiful soup with uh many vegetables and I I didn't like vegetables but I cooked it with the food so I have good memory of the food uh which she cooked. So I love her food and now I also miss her food because I live on my own.
