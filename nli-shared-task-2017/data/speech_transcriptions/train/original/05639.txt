The kind of material that I that I would like to read most is uh poetry. Why? Because poetry is um not to mention that I write poetry as my for myself. Yeah, I write a lot in my free time uh but the idea of poetry, what's what makes it really interesting is because the presence of similes and metaphors especially when it's written by famous writers like Shakespeare, I find it very interesting and entertaining at the same time.
