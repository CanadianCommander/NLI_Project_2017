I think getting admission is a in a good engineering college uh was my aim and I've made that. So I think this is the best accompl- accomplishment of my life and I had to do two years of hard work for that. I had to attend various classes throughout the day and that finally made my life, I got a good job at the engineering college where I have studied is the third ranked college of my country. I am very proud of that and uh I think that's the turning point of my life, but it require a lot of hard work.
