I think the quality I think makes someone already a member of the team is honesty because being honest means telling the truth. Um friendship cannot last long um if some lie always lies to others. If someone being honesty, the other members in the team, they'll tell they'll collaborate with each other well and team what tell tells team uh what uh happening and what the problem they can exchange ideas with the person. So being and with honesty, means telling others.
