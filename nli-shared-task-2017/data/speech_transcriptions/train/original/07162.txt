Recently I went to Australia, there I miss a lot of things about my home. I mostly I miss the food made by my mom, that is the really delicious food and the support given to me by my parents during, during when I'm in some kind of tension or stress. And I also miss the continuous battering by my younger brother nagging about me, about my girlfriend to me. And this whole thing and I miss my pets at the home who are always there, who, who always comes to me for the food and I miss my sisters and I really miss the whole comforting ambiance of my home.
