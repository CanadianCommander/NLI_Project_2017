Um I miss most in my home when I'm away is my mother's meals. Because uh I think they are very delicious and I can't cook my own meal when I'm away. And the other things I really miss when I'm away from my home is uh after meals we used to uh sit with my whole family and my father used to play saz which is Turkish um musical instrument. And we all sang songs while he was playing. I really miss uh those uh singing and those time I spend with my whole family.
