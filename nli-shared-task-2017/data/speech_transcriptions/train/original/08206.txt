Well, I like reading magazines because you can uh think about something else in your life like you know, when you read like uh tabloids, you just think about about something else you just uh uh eng- engage yourself to another world. As well I like reading novels because we can imagine everything about this story. When you read, you you just think uh the characters maybe something like like you or maybe in a different part of the world and you can imagine yourself living there or living in a different cycle, and it's easier to escape yourself from uh the point of time.
