My family very much when I'm away because I'm very uh strongly attached person. I miss my parents and my brothers and my sisters. Uh the one thing that I miss most is uh my room, because I can <%16.7> about my room uh put on some music relax over there and when I'm not at home, I really miss that setting, that scenario in which I can really relax and be have a moment of calm and peace. Uh this may not sound sound related but I also miss my cars because I really like to drive a lot in order to relax. So when I'm not away at home I miss my vehicles because they, they don't provide me, they provide me with the opportunity to uh relax and be calm.
