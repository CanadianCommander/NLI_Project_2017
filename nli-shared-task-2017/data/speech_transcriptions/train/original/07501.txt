If I could have any job that I wanted, I would choose teaching in a kindergarten. The reason why I would choose this is because I like to interact with children. I love teaching. I think teaching will be my good skill because I I can learn much and I'm also very good at finding techniques and ways of learning children. That way understand. That uh I have fun doing it.
