Because there I could leave in an international environment where I met a lot of people from different countries, was like uh Lebanon, Korea and Germany and all stuff like that. And I, and I couldn't learn all the cultures plus another, another thing that was good about that was that I could improve my English, uh as I had to attend classes in, in English. And plus I met a lot of uh professor that works in a different way than here.
