Once upon a time I was working at K-Mart Corporation and I was working as a claims manager. And I had the uh opportunity to meet uh the sales rep of Southern Wine and Spirits and he gave me the chance to work for his company. And, because he saw in me that I was a responsible young man and he wanted me to, to demonstrate my capacities in his company. So I took the chance and I start working for them and I had a great time and I prove myself and I did very well.
