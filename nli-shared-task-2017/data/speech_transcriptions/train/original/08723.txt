What I miss most when I'm away from home is especially my family. When I'm at home my family is always around, my mom is there preparing dinner for me, cleaning up and I really enjoy also ball playing with my brother, playing basketball on the garden there, playing card games or going going out in the woods. And of course I miss my father too because he's really good guy to talk to about all my problems, all the problems I have at school or university and of course I miss my friends as well who are always around when I'm at home. Um they are always there and we go out in the evening relaxing out of fun, go to the movies or probably see a basketball game.
