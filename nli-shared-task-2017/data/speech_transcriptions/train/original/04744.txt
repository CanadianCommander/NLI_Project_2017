Now I'm away from home uh Ankara is, I'm a student in Ankara  and uh I miss my family and my family life. I miss my brother, I miss my sister and my, and I miss my friends and uh I live the city life in my home town because it is more, more beautiful than Ankara. In Ankara I uh think is this is very hard to live in uh I, I miss my home very much.
