If a friend was to visit me in Bahrain, I would first take him to city mall. Because it's the biggest mall and the most popular place in Bahrain. Uh there is a lot of shopping areas in the city mall and it's the place that I go most. And I would also take him to the Souk, which is a local market which is very interesting and you can find lot of um Bahrain items there. I would also take them to the museum which shows the history of Bahrain and they can learn about Bahrain and the history of it. And I will also take them to the beach or the hotel Meridian which is a five star hotel in Bahrain which is the best hotel that you can find. And that would be it.
