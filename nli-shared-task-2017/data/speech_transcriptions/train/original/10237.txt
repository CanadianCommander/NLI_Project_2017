I will describe um one of the most uh difficult accomplishment I had during my childhood. My father was an athlete, a very famous one and he  won lots of champ- championships uh in France and in Europe and he was uh with bicycles and when I was I child I chose to uh practice judo which was completely unusual in the family given all the opportunities we have and the traditions we had. So I started to practice judo and when uh when I was a child uh different championship that required me to work very hard and u most often at nights.
