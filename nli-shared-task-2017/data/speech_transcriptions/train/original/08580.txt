What I miss about my home when I'm away is parents. There are two reasons about this. First um especially my mother, um she makes very good food everyday and I love that. So I will miss if I, when I, when I'm away from my home. Second um my father. He's very kind and he gives me a little, um a lot of kindness so I will miss his kindness when I'm away.
