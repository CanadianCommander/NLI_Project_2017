Like taking an MBA in uh some business school in order to get into that MBA I had to to send my reputation my application letter first and also to comply with two test. One test was uh the interview with an almuni and two the test was mathematical test. Because I don't have a medical, uh mathematical background nor a scientific background, I had to take the preparation class in maths and this has me a very very very uh hard work to in order to succeed first to catch up with the maths class and then to to be able to to succeed in the exam which I I did hopefully and uh and now I'm taking the class I'm very proud of it.
