I prefer to bring my friends to New York City because it's very convenient there and a lot of bus and a pass to New York City to save time and what's more there are also a lot of entertainment. For example The Broadway Show and my friend will be happy. Finally I think there are a lot of shopping mall. All of my friend like shopping very much. They are also shopping mall in New York for example Macy's and uh uh <%> maybe. The price and the quality is very good. So I choose New York City.
