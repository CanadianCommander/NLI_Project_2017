The most important thing that I miss when I'm away is uh my computer of course. The computer I have is not a bad grade it does not have a big configuration but I have the things that is most important to me there. Like things uh um I usually like to do like I like to play a lot so I have lots of computer games of my liking in the computing in, on my computer. And if I go away the first thing that I think about is I cannot play games when if I had a laptop then it would solve the problem but since I don't have one I miss my computer the most.
