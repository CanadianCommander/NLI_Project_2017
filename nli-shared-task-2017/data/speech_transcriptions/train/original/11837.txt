When uh I'm away home uh I miss different things uh. Fir- first of all of course uh I miss uh my family. So my, my parents and my sister. And also I miss the food of my mother because uh she cooks uh very well. Also since I am away from home, uh I, I am far from uh from my, my friends. And also uh in my house I have some commodities uh, uh some facilities. Uh for example like my camera. I, in my room sorry, I have television and uh I miss it very much.
