I think what I miss the most is food. Uh I live in Spain and we have a, a lot of variety kinds of foods. And everything is really cooked in very different way from other countries. And uh my, my stomach really, really miss my homemade cooking. And another thing I miss, I miss really, really, really very much is people around there. Because in Spain we are used to, to shout of people in the street and a lot of kids playing in, playing and all that. And I found when I was abroad that uh other countries um are not so, street living uh <%42.3> in, in a way.
