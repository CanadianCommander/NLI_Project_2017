When I am out of my home I miss very much my family because uh in our home we believe a lot in support each other in the good times and in the bad times, so um there is always uh a lot of talking between the members of the family. We are also very funny due to the Spanish character I guess and we are always making jokes talking about politics, uh sports like soccer or basket because we are fan of the sport. And so in the family we talk of everything with open minded and I miss them very much when I left home to go anywhere it doesn't matter anyway.
