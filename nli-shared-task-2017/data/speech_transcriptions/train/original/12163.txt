The things that I miss the most when I am away from home is my family, and is my, my friends. And um if the things that I can do with my friends and with my family. Because when I am away um I do not have the familiar um, I kind of go out with my friends and I can't stay with them, and so I feel yes I am very sad about this. And again I can do a lot of other things, but I am.
