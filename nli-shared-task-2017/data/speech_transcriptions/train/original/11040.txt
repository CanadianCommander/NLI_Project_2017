Uh the hardest thing for me was the drama class. I had to do improv and that was hard for me because I had to cram uh about a skit on the spot and you had to use your brain just as quick as you speak and also it was hard to express myself without using or talking anything. But this helped me in many ways because now I can think things faster than I was able to. So it is useful in debates and then it is also easier to express myself in front of people now. So I cannot shy away from people and now I'm more sure.
