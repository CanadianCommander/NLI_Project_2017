If a friend of mine from another country wa- is was going to spend some time in Italy, then I would suggest her or him to um to go to Venice or Florence and Rome because I think that they are the best cities in Italy because there um there are some beautiful landscape and there are many monuments and there are plenty, there is plenty of of art. And um actually I suggested to my um a friend of mine from the United States last year, she she went to Italy and she loved especially Florence and Venice because she said that they are um such a romantic cities and she she really loved them.
