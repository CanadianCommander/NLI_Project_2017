The la- the kind of material that I like to read in my free time is novels and poetry. I read this kind of material because it's very interesting. I like poetry because it's art it's part of art and novels because they're entertaining and some novels are very very similar to things that happen in real life and so some poetry pretty explains the way people's feel and in a very pretty way. Novels are also some confirmation of things that happened to other people or thus that other people has and is interesting is important to know this kind of stuff.
