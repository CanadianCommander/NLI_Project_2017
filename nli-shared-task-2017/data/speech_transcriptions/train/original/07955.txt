Well if I could choose any job I would um choose to be to be an architect it is because I'm on varsity two years and a lot of persons choose different parts of their brain. There are a lot of different matters involved from subjective to objective issues, um people can be creative or analytical. There is a lot of different things you could do at the same time, you could be designing or you could could be analyzing some data that are incorporated to the design. And that is very of use to me.
