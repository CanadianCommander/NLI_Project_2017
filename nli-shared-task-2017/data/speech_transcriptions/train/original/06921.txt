Mostly um I miss <%> people around me who is my life like especially my mother, she does my laundry and help me helps me clean my room. But apart from that I also miss other stuff in the house like the television and the computer and my couch, I really miss my couch and like outside is not that easy to find Internet in Turkey so my computer is really important also. It has too many important information. In the television we have digital so I can't find all the programs that I have there, so I really miss the television as well. But apart from that I like being outside because the social life is better than staying alone.
