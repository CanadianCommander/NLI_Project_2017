If I can choose a career in my life, I would be choosing uh to be a golfer because I like golfing. Golfing is such a fun activity because I always enjoy the nice scenery and atmosphere in a golf course. To be a golfer I can travel anywhere in the world to play golf and play all the courses around the world. At the same time while I'm playing golf or after I play golf I can visit the countries that I visit visit during my golfing tournaments. This is such a great opportunity for me to take a look at the entire world and get knowledge of different customs in in the entire world.
