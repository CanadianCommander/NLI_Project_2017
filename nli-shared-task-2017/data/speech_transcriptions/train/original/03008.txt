A very interesting book I read last <%> it's a very interesting book given that it talks about a family being hurt after the the father leaves the house and leaves um the woman and two children alone um. Lora the uh Amanda's daughter, is lives in an illusion world where she basically concentrates on keeping um glass figures which represents, she is the way she views life. She is a very fragile character and on the other side there is Tom that's Amanda's son. Tom is forced to live in an illusion world even though she doesn't he doesn't want to live there.
