The reading material I like to read is novels because uh I don't think poetry is interesting for me. But uh novels like Harry Porter or Lord Skin, Lord of Kings we can, we can be in the story we can imagine all the characters and perhaps we can think that we are the hero. So yes novel is really my favorite books and uh I read sometimes magazines about people for example to be aware of what happened in life but uh really uh books and novels are my favorite books.
