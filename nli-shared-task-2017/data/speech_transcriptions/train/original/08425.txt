If a friend from another country want to spend time in my country the place I would suggest for him to visit would be the Kashmir. There he could find one of the most uh amazing things in the world such as glaciers and he could find snow everywhere. It is on whole a beautiful site and you could find a variety of food items uh available for visitors there and hand looms and uh variety of garments available there are really amazing.
