Uh the opportunity uh going back to school was given to me. I will uh enter the school of nursing at Pacific Lutheran University in the state of Washington. It is important for me because I used to be a veterinarian in my country of origin and I haven't been able to work as such, so it gives me again a new uh road to walk on and to serve the public and to serve uh people that are in need. I really uh appreciate this opportunity is uh a new light in the tunnel and I will take advantage of it and I will do my best.
