In my opinion I think uh a group or a member is better of a team is better to have versatility, I mean like this he can have um a knowledge and like everything, a little knowledge about a project for like the future on specification. That's why he will be useful for the team. On the other side he can be help others of the others member of the group because with his knowledge he can help and um upgrade increase the project. Well that's why I think the versatility is the best quality.
