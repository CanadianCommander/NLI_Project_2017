When um the accomplishment that I find the hardest was um to get into a school, it was a public school in Australia. Um I start, I had I have studied in Australia for two years and it was when I was in grade seven um I did a test in a public school which was one of the best schools in Australia. Um it was hard but uh I had fun with competing competing with other students <%>. Otherwise it was uh my first test uh it was a test to test my English skills uh it was important for me.
