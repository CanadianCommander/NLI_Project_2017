Two thousand and four I had organized to um first student <%04.9:07.5> it was a very important accomplishment because it was the first time that I could organize a huge event to um influence young people to think about um what political change or activism they could um do in their lives. Um we invited many international guests from different countries to come to counsel and to tell about the experience in other projects. And the accomplishment is very important to me because it continues um this year two thousand and six it will be the third time that event will be held and well I'm kind of proud of it.
