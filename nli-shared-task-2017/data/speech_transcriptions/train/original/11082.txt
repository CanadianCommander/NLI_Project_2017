In recent I have read the book The Aztec which is a very interesting novel of Gary Jennings and it is very interesting because it depicts the ancient Aztec society in a way that the Aztec, Aztecs see it. So the main character is an Aztec and he travels around the country an describes what he sees on his various journeys. And it's very interesting how describes the conquest of America, the <%> which arrive and uh trouble Cort√©s causes to Latin America.
