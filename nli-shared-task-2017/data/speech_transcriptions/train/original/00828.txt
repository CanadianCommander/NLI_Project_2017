The thing I miss most uh about my home when I'm away it's my family and honestly I'm being selfish is especially my mom. Why because well you have so many advantages when you're living with your  mom. You get all this nice food, you always have a meal ready when it's lunch time or dinner time. You have your clothes wash, everything it smells good your room is tidier and if you're doing bad or you're not studying it makes you go with it and work harder. Well it's much easier to live with your mom is close by and well you save so much time for other things.
