I was given the opportunity to work in a hospital recently. That gave me the opportunity to learn about people from different cultures from Africa, America and Europe. It also gave me the opportunity to practice my English and to improve it to a certain level. It also gave me the opportunity to learn about me- medicine uh procedures and how to take care of the patient and their families. Well it helped me in many many other ways such as improving my administrative skills as well.
