The interesting book uh which I've read in the recent times is The Alchemist. Uh it's interesting because it uh because of two reasons. Uh first of all it uh has a positive signal to follow uh whatever you dream. Uh so in the uh in the book the protagonist achieves whatever he dreams of and secondly it uh also uh is uh dealt in a very interesting way. It's a thriller by nature hence you will not get bored at any stage. Generally this uh books regarding uh following your dreams and that thought will be more philosophical um in attitude but uh this book is a thriller so you don't get bored at uh any moment. So I think that's a very book.
