I live in Taipei and I think Taipei is wonderful place that uh if someone want to spend the time in my country. Taipei has uh some of the famous place that should go something like the <%> and the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is the most uh has the memorable uh building there and they are <%> in uh in theater there. And the place I I suggest that is to go is the night market, you can buy the the things uh uh good and cheap in night markets.
