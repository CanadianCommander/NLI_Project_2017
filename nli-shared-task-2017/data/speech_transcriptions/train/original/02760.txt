Um I greatly read my novels. I'm currently reading a fiction. Um it's um it was just published just by Dave Eggers. It's called What is the What. I've read all his books. He was a poster price nominee on his first novel. I'm eying <%> maybe I'll read his six or eight a year, and I also try to balance it with some non-fiction. I really enjoy criticism. I read a lot of architecture because it's my field. Magazines-wise, I try to read on design and uh architecture magazines a couple a month. Poetry, I may read poetry book a year, not too often but I enjoy it greatly too.
