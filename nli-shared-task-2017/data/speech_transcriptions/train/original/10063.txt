One accomplishment that I'm particularly proud of is organizing the students technical conference in my college. Being the General Secretary of the club, it was my responsibility to organize the annual technical fest. I'm extremely proud of this accomplishment because this was the first time that I was given uh, that uh, that I was given position of responsibility and I can proudly say that I was able to discharge the responsibility to the best of my ability. The conference was a <%34.2> success and the st- the students as well as the faculty together congratulated me on my endeavor. And it.
