An interesting book I have read before is Rome- uh Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare because it describes a tragic romance and that tra- tragedy really um that tragedy really inspire me in how I think about the tragic romance. And the, I love the background of Juliet and how those two families went against each other was very sad.
