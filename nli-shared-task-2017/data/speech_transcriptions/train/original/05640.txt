If I could have the career that I want, I would choose to have a career in Forensic Science. Um mainly because this field offer all of these different challenge because you never have the same work to do. You always have different samples and you have always different cases and I would like to have that. Also to work in this field because it is really a growing field because it's a new science so they always have new technology and new techniques to work in that field. I would also would like to work in Forensic because it's really diverse field. You can work in Chemistry, Entomology, Toxicology, Psychology or any other thing like Computer Science. So Forensic Science is really a good field.
