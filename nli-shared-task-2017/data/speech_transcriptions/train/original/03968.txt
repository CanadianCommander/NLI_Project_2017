Um in my free time I like to read fiction novels. Um my preference is for fiction novels because they take you to an uh uncharted levels of fantasy where you can imagine things which usually don't happen in our daily lives and um it's not mon- monotonous routine work. It's like imagining different things, different happenings that happens which is comprised of suspense, mystery, thrill and um it's just different from everyday routine life and uh it gives you new hope, new perspective on things and uh inspires.
