In these days I am reading a book uh called The Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. It's uh a book I read for my, uh for my Physic course at the university. I think this book is interesting because uh it explain in a clearly way all the things that you need to know to understand the quantum mechanics. And uh according to this theory you are able to explain a lot of interesting uh behavior of uh the other world. So I think it is very interesting. Maybe it's not an easy lecture but I think uh it is very interesting for me.
