I like reading novels best in my free time. There are several reasons for this, first I think reading novels is a very good method for me to relax myself. I always spend the whole day sitting in my room reading room quietly and my reading my favorite English novel such as The Pride and Prejudice. And the second reason that uh not only I can improve my English through reading these novels but I can learn about the cultures in other countries such the living habits, the thinking patterns. So I think uh that novels can bring more benefits to me than other reading materials and I like reading novels best. That's all.
