The contradiction which is very required is the hardest, giving lectures to the students because it is a very hard task to control all the students in the classroom. And moreover it is very hard to give the notes and meanwhile giving the lecture before the class. And we had to do a lot of homework before we do the lecture and it is very hard to control all the class and maintain and to get in the same frequency to all. And, and we can give a lecturer a different topic but it is very difficult to answer they need questions uh which is raised by the students at the time, and it is very difficult to control all the students and all the class in needed time.
