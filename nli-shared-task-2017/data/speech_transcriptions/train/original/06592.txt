When I leave home the things I miss most uh well I’ve been in Taiwan since I was seven years old, no three years old and I know nothing else actually. I’ve lived in the same neighborhood for twelve years. So I, those are the things I'm familiar with. Uh for instance families, friends, the school, the scenery. Uh I really don't have what I miss the most actually.
