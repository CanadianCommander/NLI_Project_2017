Yeah I like reading magazines because it's kind of full of pictures and good stuff because novels and poetry is kind of boring. Novels is like text book for me full of text and all the stuff. I don't like reading that stuff. Magazine is kind of good. I like looking at pictures and reading is like uh <%> for me but yeah I get basic picture of what all is written in the magazines by looking at the pictures and yeah. So I find magazines kind of interesting as far as novels and poetry is concerned. That's it.
