I miss most about my home when I was away is the hiking of the mountain. The first reason is that when I hiking up the mountain I feel very comfortable. There is a lot of beautiful flowers and cute animals in the mountain so every time when I go there I feel comfortable. Another reason is that every time when I hiking up the mountain, I feel healthy. I also can lose my weight when I go mountain. This this is the reason that I really miss most of my.
