To the question, I would say that was my graduated project of my architecture. Why it is so hard because it is not only have to be prepared for one year you also have to cooperate it with many <%> and including to your teacher. And and you have to show all the abilities you learn in these five years and why it is important because through the project you can show about and know about what you learned in this years and how and the the direction you want to attend in your maybe further graduated studies. So that's why it is important to this project.
