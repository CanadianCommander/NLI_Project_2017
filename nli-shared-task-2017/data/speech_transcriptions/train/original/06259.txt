The most important opportunity I have ever was uh one years ago I found a research assistant profe- uh position in UCLA uh <%> department um and the topic was related to the <%> of the <%> design. And I spend half a year to read some paper in order to be, to build, build my <%> knowledge and learned a lot and improve my- myself about my research ability a lot during those year. And um so that's the most important opportunity I have ever and I appreciate that I have this kind of opportunity.
