If I could choose a job I'd do I would choose to be a teacher because I like to teach and I like to teach children but I would like to teach at high school because I think they are more older and they know what they have to do because young children in primary school they don't know, doesn't know, don't know exactly what the school is and yes I would like to do this because if you're older and when you want to have children you can also work part time.
