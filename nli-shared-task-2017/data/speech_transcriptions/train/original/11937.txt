Friend from other country if you want to spend his time our in our country I visit the I would suggest him the best place would be my home home because vising places uh and taking photographs over there and it doesn't give uh experience and it doesn't know about the culture and other religious actions of the people. Um moreover uh in various magazines uh radios and magazines he can get all the photographs of the places uh which they visit. So I say it will be rather a better area to visit your friends with <%>.
