The interesting book I have read is uh World, World of Gap. I'm not sure the title is correctly in English or not but the novel is wrote it, write it from by uh John <%21.5>. Why I like the <%24.0> is because the main guest, the name, his name is Gap he's very uh aggressive person and and I, I get very uh uh I like the way he's thinking positively. That's why.
