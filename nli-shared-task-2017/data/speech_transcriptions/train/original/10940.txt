Two years ago, I was a a member of a team in Belgium. I was the leader of the team. I think that uh a valuable member of a team uh would be well organised and should have uh team spirit. I think the two, uh these two qualities are very important in a team. You have to, to, to think about the team with the other person. You have to be able to collaborate with the other in respect with the other members of the group. You have to respect their opinion and the point of views of everybody in the group. And that will make you a valuable member of a team.
