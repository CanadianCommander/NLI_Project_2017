I like mostly to read uh the novels because they invite, give me information about uh the life of different people especially on their personality and their news of life and also, their different views of uh different orders that are stated in the novels. That's what I really like most uh other than what is hap- happening <%> and in uh in addition to those, also I'm having information about different parts of the world too because uh in novels, the writers are from different parts of the world and they are reflecting their own culture and their own countries and each is owning each country is really fascinating for me.
