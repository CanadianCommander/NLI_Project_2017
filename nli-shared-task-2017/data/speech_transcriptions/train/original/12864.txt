I had the possibility to be an exchange student in the year of two thousand and four and two thousand and five. I was really lucky because I found a nice family the name was <%11.6> and they accepted me like um their own child not like an exchange student. I learned English over there high school and I graduated from the high school later when I went back to Austria. It was great for me and was big opportunity for me to be there actually in America because um I knew a lot about the American culture and how the people act over there and also  about the well, about the life how  people live there it was awesome.
