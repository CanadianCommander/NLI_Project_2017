S- since I stay away from my home, um almost uh half a day from my uh, from my uh, uh home time, hometown. Uh the things I miss most about uh my home are uh one I miss the food. Uh home cooked food. Uh two I miss, since I'm married I miss my wife and my kids so much I dearly uh hope and wish that I am, I, I, I, I am able to spend more time with them. And most importantly I miss the warmth and love of my mother and father, my brother and the friends with whom I have grown up all my life. Uh just to sum up I think I miss everything uh of my home.
