I would rather read magazine than any other uh material to read. The only uh there are several reasons to it, first of all the magazine deal with normal day topic and when I go to school, when I talk to my friends about it then I can share information what I read and what they read. Also is cheap cheaper to buy a magazine from a store. Also the store which sells the magazines are comparatively close to our home. As a result I'll, I will prepare to read magazine in a free time.
