Alexandria is the city I, most want my friends to come and visit as it is situated on the North of Egypt on the Mediterranean sea. It is very famous for its beaches and it's fine sands. It has very many, many famous interesting places such as the Montaza palace, uh the Bibliotheca, the Roman wreck museums, the <%25.6> gardens, many, most to visit <%29.6> go out in evening and also the night life and cafe to go seat by. Alexandria is also a very clean and calm city in Egypt. That's why I would like them to go.
