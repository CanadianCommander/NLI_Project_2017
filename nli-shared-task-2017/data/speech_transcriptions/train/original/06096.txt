If my friends from another country were to spend time in my country which is India, I would ask them to come visit Delhi the Capital of India. Delhi is a place where people from other metropolitan cities in India come and have found a living. Delhi is a place of historical importance in our country and also Delhi had essential monuments such as Red Fort, the Parliament House and other various places like the Qutub Minar which must be visited by anybody who's talking a tour of India. Delhi is a place of exquisite beauty and also combines uh old charm which others.
