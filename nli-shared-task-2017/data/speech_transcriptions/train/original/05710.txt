If I had visitors in my country I would show them the capital of my country which is uh the city Berlin. I would show them Berlin because it is the capital of Germany and it is kind of typical city in Germany, which means that you will leave all usual, kinds of people that you will meet in Germany. And it is the biggest city in Germany. So there is lot of stuff like sight seeing events, concerts, uh parks whatever that they can visit and see ans whatever you hear about Germany you will see pictures of Berlin so you should see all those stuff on your own while you are in Germany. And um another point is that I would.
