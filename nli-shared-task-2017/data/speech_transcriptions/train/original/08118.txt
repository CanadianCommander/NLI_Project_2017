If friends from another country were coming to visit and spend time in the country I live in Germany at the moment, I would first show them around my city because I know about the city well of course. And I could take them around for shopping and I can recommend them where to eat. It would be nice if i can accompany them and know where to go. The second place I will suggest them to go to will be in Munich where there is the Neuschwanstein castle which inspired me when I first went there. I think it will also be a nice experience for them to go there and they will get a nice impression of what Germany is like from from going there.
