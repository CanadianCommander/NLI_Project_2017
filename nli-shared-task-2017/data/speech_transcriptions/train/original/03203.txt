Uh the book I was uh interested by reading was the, about the life of uh Mahatma Gandhi who was called as the father of a nation. Uh the book, uh the reason why it interested me was uh it depicted uh how a powerful uh man's humility can be on others uh without even fighting with each other. By the means of non-violence he uh attained freedom for our country. Uh it also showed how uh we should lead our life and uh by humility and by straightforwardness which can help us reach uh great success and uh help us to attain a lot great things in life.
