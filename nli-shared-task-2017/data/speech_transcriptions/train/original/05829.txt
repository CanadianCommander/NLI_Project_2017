When I think of my, my mum miss me a lot uh of when I left my home indeed first of all she's really, really good cooker while I don't know cooking and that was a big shock for me to live this my house. Then my, my mum is a person who listen to me whenever I want to speak to her she wo- she had been ready to listen and uh help me to find solution. Whereas why when I left home I had been alone in my apartment and I when I uh face the problem I will have to solve.
