I prefer to be a pharmacist if I had the opportunity to work. This way I can serve the community better by providing the required medical uh and uh drug assistance. Helping the elderly to lead a better life and youngsters how to survive the uh infant uh diseases such as polio and other diseases. Uh this also gives me great pleasure to interact with people, serving to their immediate needs, and that way connect to this community and the society at in the larger perspective.
