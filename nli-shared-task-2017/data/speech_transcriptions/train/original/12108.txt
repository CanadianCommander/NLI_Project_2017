Although I enjoy reading magazines and newspapers very much to get information about what is happening in the world, I rather prefer reading novels. They contain stories of life uh the fictional stories, they uh, they contain experiences that the authors made in their lives and you can learn, I think you can learn much from them. It's also a good way at uh relive of stress and to get your mind off things uh when you read. I uh I personally read uh some novels uh in the last two weeks and I found interesting to get opinions on different topics and uh to get an idea of what other people think of and what they uh made their mind up.
