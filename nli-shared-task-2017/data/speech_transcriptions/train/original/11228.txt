The accomplishment um I tried to work very hard for and I had to prepare a lot for is um the ability to speak and um to improve my um English um language skills. I worked very hard for that because it was very important tome um to live in an um foreign country especially in a country in which English is spoken and that's why I'm it was very important for me to improve my language skills in English. And I tried to improve them by learning vocabularies by watching English television and all that stuff in order to um improve it all the time and this was very important for me because um living and speaking in an English uh speaking company was one of my main goals which I wanted to achieve.
