An accomo- an accomplishment I worked very hard for was my first <%> exam because that was when I graduated from law school in Germany and it required me to work very hard because you had to prepare very um different exam times, exam types uh like a written exam and an oral exam. And I study for that about one year and it is very important for me because it actually decides about your um later law career and you have to use that in every um application for law firm or whatever you decide to do later on.
