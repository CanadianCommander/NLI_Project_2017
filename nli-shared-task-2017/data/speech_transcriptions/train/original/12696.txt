Uh an interesting book that I have read recently is the Da Vinci Code written by Dan Brown. The book is basically on modern mistery and it talks about the holy grail. I found the book interesting because it was one of the first most first paces to learn that I have read till day. Each page turn had a new twist and and turn in the story and that made this book a very interesting read. Also the book gave a lot of details about Christian history and uh about uh the last supper and all that information was interesting to get. So the book was very informative and exciting. That is why it was good interesting.
