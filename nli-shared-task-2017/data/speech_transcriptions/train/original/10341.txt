When I'm far from home I'm most miss my house my family because uh uh the way of life at home is different from away. There there is my mother who looks after me and so I'm sure that all goes in a the better way. I live in a a beautiful house so I have all the comfortable that I need. And there is also my dog and he's very very important for me. It makes me very happy.
