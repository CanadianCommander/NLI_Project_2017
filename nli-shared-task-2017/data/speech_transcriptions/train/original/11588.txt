If friends from another country are going to spend time in my country, I am going to show them around Seoul which is the capital city of Korea. It's a big city and there are tall buildings and many other amusement park and other places to, other places that I can I show it to them. There are also many cultural places um I can show them how uh the cultures are in Korea, and I'll take them to some um Korean restaurants so I can make them try the different types of foods that are from Korea. I think that would be a good choice.
