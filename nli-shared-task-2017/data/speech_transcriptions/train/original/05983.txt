Quality is very important because sometimes another team member got a injury like uh leg break broken or hand broke so we need uh confirm another person. So we changed to another person to play game for sport. So quality is important to our team but sometimes a lot of qualities for that group sometimes some member uh missed the chance but I think quality is very important to the team. That's it.
