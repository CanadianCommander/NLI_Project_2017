Uh I think two quality uh will make someone valuable member in a team. The first one is faithful that means that will be loyalty loyal in your team. Second one is uh cooperate, cooperation ability, this means that uh you have the ability to uh operate with your uh team group and also you have the ability to cooperate with uh someone who is uh not in your team member. So this two are qualities that I think it's most uh a valuable member quality.
