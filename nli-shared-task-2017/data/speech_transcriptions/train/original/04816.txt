Um my greatest accomplish I would say was to teach my father to reply and forward his emails because he is really bad with computers and stuff and obviously I'm very good at it. My degree is on how to use a computer and certificates. I spend a lot of time with computers but my father didn't obviously so uh it he it was really hard to teach him to use computers and emailing 'cause it's very all new to him and he's not very good at it.
