There are fa- factors that <%> with the this member of a group is valuable one or not. First of all honesty. Honesty is very important for uh any group. If a person is not honest enough, how can the other members deal with him? So in my opinion, honesty comes on the top of all uh uh values. We cannot be friends with people who are not honest enough or and so on, and that's it.
