I have read a really interesting book, it is called The Lord of the Rings. Uh I think this book is very popular around the world because it has been rated in a lot of languages but I preferred it in English. The book is about uh middle earth. It's a little land where elves and hobbits live and it is about a hobbit who wants to fight against the evil in this place. It is comparable to the modern world because you always have to fight against your own evils. You have to fulfill tasks and to do the best for the good, to do everything to fulfill your life.
