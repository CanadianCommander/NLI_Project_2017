Five years ago I had special opportunity um to go to Canada for two months as mother helper in a family with uh four young children. It was really a good opportunity for me because um I could during these these two months I improve my English and also spend time in a country that um I had never visited. So um it was really great opportunity and um I decided to go there. Uh, at the beginning it was a bit difficult, but um when I came back to France it was really a good experience.
