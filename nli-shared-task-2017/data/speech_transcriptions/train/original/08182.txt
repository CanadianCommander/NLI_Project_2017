A special opportunity I was given was to attend a student council leadership camp at Temple university in Pennsylvania. The opportunity was important because it involved leadership skills and it helped me meet new people, it helped me learn skills to help my school improve activities like homecoming dances, prom, and spirit week. We all lived in <%31.3> so we all became really close and we learned how to live a good campus live and worked together cooperatively to come up with solutions to problems. It was very educational.
