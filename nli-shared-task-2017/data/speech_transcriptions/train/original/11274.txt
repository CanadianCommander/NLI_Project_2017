I was given the opportunity to work with Professor David Thurston in his organic chemistry lab in the University of uh London, School of Pharmacy. The opportunity was really very important because uh the lab co- consisted of very knowledgeable and experienced people. I was being uh given guidance by uh Dr. Phil Howard and Jeff <%> and I learned many important techniques of organic chemistry and organic synthesis. I learned how to work in a research environment, how to read papers, how to apply the knowledge which I was uh getting, how to organize your experiments, how to think.
