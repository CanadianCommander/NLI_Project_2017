I love to read about history or culture of a country because basically it uh help us to provide information about the origin of the country, how people lived there, uh what's the environment there and their culture, their monuments, their architecture, the government, the behavior of of people, appearance of people. Basically I love to uh know about culture and culture and a history on that uh particular place or country or something like that in some place other than uh some interesting place.
