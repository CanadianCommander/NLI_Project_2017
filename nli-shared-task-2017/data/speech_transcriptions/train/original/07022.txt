When I am abroad for example, one of the most things I miss are my friends because uh we are always together. And another thing is my family, because they are always, yeah, something like a backup for me and yeah not, there, there are some more uh yeah topics which I miss but they are only I think in the second row like the language, the food and yeah, I think that's it.
