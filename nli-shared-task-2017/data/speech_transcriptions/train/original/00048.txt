If I could have any job career I wanted, I wanted to be a reporter or a generator. My reason is because um I think this job is pretty pretty attractive. Um ever since I was a child, I dream of being a reporter because I saw them in the TV and they they always bring the latest information to us. Another reason is because, um if I be the reporter, I maybe na- I may have the chance to travel around the world and tell people what's happening in the global village. I think reporter is uh is uh work that <%>.
