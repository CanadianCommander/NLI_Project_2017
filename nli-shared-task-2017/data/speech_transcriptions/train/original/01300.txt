Sixteen I have the opportunity to <%> in Australia VNF um an exchange organization named AFF. My parents had to pay a lot of money for me to be able to take part in the exchange program. Um that was a very important experience for me because I wasn't only able to learn English very well but I was also able to spend a lot of time with an Australian family. I lived with the host family in Australia in a little c- town called Tulumba which is located about two hours west of Brisbane. I really loved it there. I learned so much about the culture of another country and so much about the Australian way of life. It was one of the best years of my life.
