An interesting book that I have read and that I would like uh to talk about was the Da Vinci Code. I know it may seem like uh you know a usual answer but for me it's not. It was very interesting because at first I had a different idea of what the book was about. I thought it was a book about historical, historical facts and history mainly and I was rather surprised by the fact that it was a novel, and a novel which included of course historical facts. I was, it seemed to me interesting because I was amazed by the, you know, by the difference opinions this book was uh getting out of peo-.
