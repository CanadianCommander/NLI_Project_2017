Well I guess I could say a special opportunity that was given to me recently uh last year was uh being posted to San Francisco. I work in the Canadian Foreign Service and uh it, I it was my second San- San Francisco was my second assignment abroad. First one had been Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Uh for many, many reasons San Francisco is a highly committed post and um I applied for that one as well as for several others and uh I managed to uh land here. So I feel it is very special opportunity why it's important it's uh a high profile position in a high profile posts. Lots of people come by so its a good way of getting known to the department.
