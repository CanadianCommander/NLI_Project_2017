I prefer to read novels because I love long stories  I like to read a book about like two hundred three hundred pages and because I find it way more exciting than um like poetry. Because a poetry is very short um novels describe a whole story like a law story or story about the war or stories about different cultures and I find you can um get so much more information um uh you get so much more information in a novel than in a poem and um that's why I prefer novels because for me they are just more I think.
