I would like to become a teacher because I think a teacher's job is important and meaningful. It took me so much time and effort to learn what I've learned and to become what uh what I am now and uh I I like uh to teach other people so they don't have to spend as as much time and they will be able to become more successful than I am now. My dad is a professor and I remember how happy he was when he saw his students uh uh became successful. So I like to have uh the same career as a teacher.
