What I like reading most is not poetry but novels or magazines because I think that poetry is or can be um quite uh difficult to understand. Um I like novels better because um I like reading story about people I can relate to and who I can identify with. Um magazines, I like to read because they provide information about things I'm interested in like nature, for example.
