The kind of reading material such as novels, magazines and poetry I like to read in my free time is topics especially regarding history because I find history very amazing to know everything that happened on earth and how and the stages human have been through especially human regarding human life. Because you learn from the stories that you learn from the mistakes that people made so you learn from how discoveries happen and as they say history repeats itself therefore there is so much to learn it's also entertaining because sometimes it could be funny sometimes it could be tragic tra-  tragic.
