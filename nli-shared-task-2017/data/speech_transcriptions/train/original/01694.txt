I would take my friend to the most beautiful place in Mexico like Cancun in the first place. I would take them to Cancun because the beach is beautiful, the sand is like, like dust. The, the, the sea is very, very clear, the, the landscapes are amazing. Near the Ca- near Cancun is Riviera Maya where a lot of archi- archaeological and structures are, were made in, in that place. And it's a very, very beautiful place. You can do a lot of things, you can go to very good restaurants, you can go to, if you like to party you can go to party.
