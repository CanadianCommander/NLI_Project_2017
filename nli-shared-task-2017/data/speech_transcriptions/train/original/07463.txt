Next day I was far away from for the last year and I really liked it but of course I missed a lot of things. First of course I missed my family and my friends to talk in my own language, and to talk to them to the people who know me and to whom I don't have to explain everything. Furthermore, I missed the food, because you have food in abroad is also nice but uh food you are accustomed to in your county is the best. And then I also missed my room and my bed um a place where I can, where know  and where I, I feel more comfortable.
