An interesting book that I have recently read maybe The Biography of Bill Clinton. First of all, I uh have always admired the great uh politicians such as uh Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton and uh he describes uh in a whole sense uh all that he has endeavored to do in his whole life and that remains a good example for the following uh uh willing to be politicians or uh it's an example of uh a great man and a great life and it can be useful for the past uh generations.
