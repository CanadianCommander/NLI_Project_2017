Of course, Italy is very famous in the world for it's uh beautiful monuments. Personally, would suggest to this friend to visit first of all Rome because Rome is the one of the most ancient city in Italy and probably the most beautiful. After Rome, I would also suggest to visit Florence and of course Venice because Venice is really an interesting city city and quiet unique in the world. I live in Turin so I would like also him to visit Turin also he also is uh he find out that Turin is not a very very important but uh I would really like my friends to visit uh Turin.
