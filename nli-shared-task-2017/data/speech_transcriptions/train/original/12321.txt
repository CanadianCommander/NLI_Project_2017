One of the accomplishments that I had to work very hard was the national examination for the university uh in my country. So, I worked very hard for uh years in my high school and then started to uh analyze the possible universities that I can enter. And as a result I entered one of the best universities in Turkey and now it is better for me because uh I'm educated well academically and also the university can provide me um better projects in my courses. Furthermore for future uh careers uh the university has many good uh connections with uh international sectors so I can take one of the good jobs in for my future career.
