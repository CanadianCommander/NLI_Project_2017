I think the most important quality a valuable member of a team uh must have is uh leadership. In fact, in every kinds of team uh in which uh everybody can be involved whatever uh is it in sport or in, in a job, uh every team need a leadership in order to motive the other member of the team and in order to secure the other member of the team. Ans moreover to be careful of the full involvement on everybody in order to achieve a goal or in order to win a game if you're talking about sports. For me that's the best quality.
