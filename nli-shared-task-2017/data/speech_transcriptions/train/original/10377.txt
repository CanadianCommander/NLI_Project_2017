I think the most important quality that someone needs to have on a team is responsibility. Each uh each individual person is one, I mean is one with the team and if this person isn't responsible, this could lead to the team failure. If so if some lets say someone doesn't, it is a big important game and someone isn't responsible enough to come with uh to assist you to come to the game or even to not bring his stuff his spo- uh his sports clothes or anything, the team would be in a disadvantage because they won't have this member.
