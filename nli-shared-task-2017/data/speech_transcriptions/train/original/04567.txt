When I'm far away from home, I miss a lot of things um for example the food, the typically Ger- typically German food. Um it's like the German, I don't know <%> something like that, um there is this food has got uh yeah has got a taste which I'm used to. I also I miss my family, my mother, my brother, everyone my family and my friends. Um I like to be with them, they give me a good feeling and when I'm abroad I feel so alone because I don't know anyone. Um I also miss the nature of my home because very often when I'm far away there are just big cities without any trees and something like that so this comes all together.
