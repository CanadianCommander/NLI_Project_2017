Yeah I miss all uh of course and uh my family because uh they live in the, the place where I grew up. And uh and uh of course my friends as well, I miss spending my time in the evenings with them, going out or watching movies and yeah if I'm away, uh it's always uh the people you meet there, they'll always they are also part of your life, but uh yeah not in the way like the, the people you grew up with, and uh who, who brought you up. Of course I uh I miss uh I'd say the, the comfort level of living in a place that you know, because uh whenever you leave uh your home you have to adopt to, to the new surroundings and environment that's difficult and a lot easier when you're back home.
