I want to mention about uh the book the last, latest I read uh by <%6.8>. It's the <%8.7>. Uh I like the book because it's provides with lot of useful information about uh humans, uh human beings, uh how we think, uh how we live our lives, for instance uh you do several things in your daily life and that's uh, without even noticing why you are doing that. Uh the author in the book uh tries to give you an insight, tries to give you an understanding of wh- why we are doing that, why we should do that. Uh I like the book because of these reasons.
