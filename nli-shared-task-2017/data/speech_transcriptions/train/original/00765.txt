I suggest to spend time in our capital in uh, in Rome because it's a very beautiful city. It's a great city because uh the, there are a lot of uh acetonic things like Colosseum for Imperiali and a lot of thing for enjoying time with friends. Also in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, you can take place uh, you can take, you may have a, a dinner for example in a <%29.4> Squares and after uh, uh see all things and shops that are open uh until uh evening. It's fantastic, it's the best city Italy.
