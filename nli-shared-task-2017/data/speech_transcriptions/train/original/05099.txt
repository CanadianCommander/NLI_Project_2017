There are many quality that I think is are important in a member of a team but I think the most important is the competence in the topic you are working on. I think if you want to succeed uh in a in any kind of job of work you really have to know the field in which you are involved in. So I think that at least uh the most important uh members of the group should really learn about the topic more than the others. And they have to share their knowledge and their competence with the group to achieve the goals.
