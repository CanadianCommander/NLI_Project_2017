The most interesting book I have read would have to be uh uh Laughing Gas P. G. Wodehouse. The language used in the book is very simple and lucid, it's very easy to understand. And uh the the story is written in such a beautiful way which uh makes it really easy for the reader to understand and appreciate the story. And uh the book I mean the whole story is surely uh you know it's more of sarcasm but uh it's done in a very humorous way written in a very nice and humorous way. And uh the book the book makes a very interesting read and you can read it uh a number of time uh over.
