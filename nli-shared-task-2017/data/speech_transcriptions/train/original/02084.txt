Um the things I miss about my home when I'm away are bedroom and food I think. Um first of all bedroom because it's really comfortable at my home unlike in other place it doesn't feel like my own room so it's not really that convenient outside. And secondly food because I can't eat the same food we eat at home when we're out and I really miss my mother's homemade cookies and foods when I,  when I'm not at home, when I go outside. So the two most things that I really miss are my bedroom and my food I think.
