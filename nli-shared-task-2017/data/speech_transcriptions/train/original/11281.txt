I prefer reading <%> and not novels because I think novels are just not coming to point. I will liked more I will like more fictional uh lecture, like as I said fictional books and even when I often don't have time to read novels because since I do study my time is very limited and I don't have a lot of time to read a five hundred page book. So I focused more only on on non fictional books which are more like one hundred and fifty to two hundred pages and which I can get more information out which are more important for me. So I really like prefer uh non fictional books and magazines which can fit to my time best.
