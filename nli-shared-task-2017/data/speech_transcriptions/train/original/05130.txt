If I had friends coming to France uh and they have never been uh in France before I should uh tell them to  visit Paris first because this is among the biggest cities and the most important one. And they can visit museums such as The Louvre, Eiffel tower and other places uh which is not which are not pretty touristic um little caf√©s, little restaurants but if they want to visit France as a whole country I shall tell them to visit Lille which is a country uh sorry uh city that I really like and there's also friends then to make some uh visit in villages which are really uh uh important in French culture.
