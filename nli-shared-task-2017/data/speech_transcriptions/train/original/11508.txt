When I'm, when I'm away from home I usually miss my family and my friends most. Because they are the persons who are the most important for me and when I do not see them for uh a long time I miss our conversations, I miss um having fun with them, I miss talking with them in general. But what I also miss is that when I'm um away from home in another country for example I miss um the food that is very specific um to Germany especially the bread is very special in Germany and I like the taste of it and um the fact that there are very different kinds of bread in Germany that are usually not available in other countries.
