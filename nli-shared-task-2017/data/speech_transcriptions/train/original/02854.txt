For a friend to visit my country Switzerland could be a great opportunity because we can visit together different locations. Firstly, the cities and the plain because we have a diverse architecture and diverse languages from ZÃ¼rich to Geneva including Lausanne And Lucerne. On the other side, I had to mention that uh we should visit The Alps with the beautiful mountains and he had the opportunity to see snow, to ski and uh afterwards we can travel to the beautiful lakes we have in Switzerland.
