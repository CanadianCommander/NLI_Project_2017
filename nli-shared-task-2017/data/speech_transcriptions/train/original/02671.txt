Uh in country I would I would suggest uh to uh visit Kyoto which is very beautiful city. Uh there are many traditional monuments, temples and shrines which remain from uh the really uh uh early periods of Japan. Uh especially the reason why it's been a traditional uh uh temples and shrines remaining is because uh there were no dis-construction during the uh Second World War and still there is uh strong uh restriction on uh keeping the uh city that is beautiful as it is.
