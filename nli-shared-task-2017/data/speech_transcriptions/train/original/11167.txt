I will choose to be an interior designer because I love to decorate the furniture inside the house, I have, it's well my experience and my habit, I <%> to do it and I'm very satisfied with it, um well because me and my mom when I was small we used to do some decorations inside the house and I really enjoyed this stuff. And I really like the design stuff, I have my own point of views, my own paint, my own designs that I can draw, I can put together.
