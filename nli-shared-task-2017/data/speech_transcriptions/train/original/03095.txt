When I joined as <%2.4> at my first job um there was manual testing. Um so my, uh my uh boss asked to me to review an automation tool. I think that opportunity was very important to me because um I have looked at a lot of uh variety of tools and I know the number of tools that were available in the market. So I had a good knowledge about uh different kinds of tools and their advantages and disadvantages. Uh I reviewed the tool and uh I, they ended up buying the tool. Uh so I had an opportunity to implement all my test cases uh using this automation tool which I think they is very important for my career.
