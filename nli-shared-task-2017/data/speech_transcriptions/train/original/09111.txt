I think the value that make a person member of a team, I mean value as a member of a team is to be honest. Why do I think that honesty is the good quality of a team or a group to have? They have to tell what they are doing to each other, they have to share what they're doing in order to improve the team work, they have to stick together. I mean honesty should be the best team to do, to be honest each other, to tell the truth.
