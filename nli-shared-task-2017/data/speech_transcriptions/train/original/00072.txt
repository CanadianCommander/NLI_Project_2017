If my friends from another country were going to spending time in my country, first of all I will take them to travel through the Taipei city. And it is the main city in Taiwan and there is a lot of uh beautiful buildings and a lot of famous place. And they also have a lot of entertainment like uh karaoke. And Taipei is famous for the night life so I might take my friend to go around to shop in the department store. And then I will take them to the main city of Taiwan uh which is names Taichung.
