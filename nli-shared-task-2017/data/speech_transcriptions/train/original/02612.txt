An accomplishment required me to work very hard is dance. I learned Indian classical dance and I worked very hard for achieving it requires a lot of strenuous work. Everyday I used to practice, I still practice and it is important to me because it's a depiction of the Indian culture. And um dance is a way expressing a feeling. Also dance is a good exercise and um when you dance you relieve yourself of all the tensions is very good <%>. And so it is very important to me and I have worked very hard for it.
