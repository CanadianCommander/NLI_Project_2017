For me an important accomplish that require a lot of work for me it was very hard and I think I got it was the fact that I wanted to study law and I wanted to learn a lot of languages too. For that reason, I had to go during six year, I had to go to law school to get my degree and at the same time during the those breaks I had at school, I wanted languages goal to learn English and to learn French. I had no time for anything else 'cause when I was back home, I had to prepare my law classes, I have to study.
