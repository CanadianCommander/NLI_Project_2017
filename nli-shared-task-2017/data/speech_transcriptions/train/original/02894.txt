My favorite reading material in my free time are novels. They help me to relax and I love to get stories told so I enjoy it very much to read novels and to get new characters to know and have like little movie in my head. I like to imagine things very much and I most like to think oh how could it end. It is very much fun and um it relieves me from stress.
