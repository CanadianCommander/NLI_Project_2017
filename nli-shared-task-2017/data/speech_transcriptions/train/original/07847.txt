The toughest accomplishment I have ever seen in my life at age of twenty one right now, I'm the acting head of the family because my dad met with an accident in November and he's still in the <%> status. Taking care of all the family issues right at the end of the graduation was very difficult for me. There were days I didn't sleep, there days I didn't eat. I had to meet so many difficult situations, had to convince so many people, I have to take care of all the liabilities of the family, give my mother the morale support that everything is going to be fine. This was the greatest accomplishment for me.
