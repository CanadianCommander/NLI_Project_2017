Well lately I've read um Dan Brown's last book the tittle is Angels and Demons. And I found in the pages of the book and a very accurate description of uh the city where the uh plot is set. Rome, Rome and Vatican museums. I find uh a good description of the um our church uh churches in the streets of Rome and I know this city very well. Um I had the the uh the sensation feeling to live the adventure just on the side of the main character of the book. Um that's the main reason because I already uh uh enjoyed that.
