If my friend from another country were going to spend time in my country I'll strongly suggest Tokyo in Japan uh because Tokyo has everything. First of all, there are a lot of place to play. Uh for example, when I was a university student uh I played tennis and I could easily find a place to play tennis. Second of all, uh Tokyo has also has a lot of green. Uh for instance, uh when I was when I worked at my former company, uh I could go to picnic and I had a lot of fun. For these reasons as I mentioned as I've already mentioned, I strongly recommend Tokyo.
