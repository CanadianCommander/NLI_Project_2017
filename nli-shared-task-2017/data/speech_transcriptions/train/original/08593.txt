What I most miss about um when I leave from my hometown is my family actually I have that exactly same experience. I live in Beijing for three years and I have to sep- separate away from my two of my family like my sister and my brother. When I lived together, I didn't miss any time, I had a call many times, I got to fight a lot but like when I left them from Japan, actually I really miss my sister because she is one of the my best friend, we call by phone and we email when email many times but actually my sister is still best friend.
