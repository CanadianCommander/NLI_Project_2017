I would tell my friends to come to the uh capital of Dominican Republic which is Santo Domingo. Uh I would tell them them that because I believe it's uh the most representative city of the whole nation, Dominican Republic and that's where all the um economic movement is made in the capital. And there are also a lot f places uh to take them like the Malecon so they can see the ship at sea core, seashore and there is a lot of culture belonging here. There is uh the night life is very active here. There are a lot of clubs where you can take these friends.
