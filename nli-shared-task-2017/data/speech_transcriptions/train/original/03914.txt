Which I have read in my life is the electronics and communications book which I have followed in my first year of engineering. As a child, I always thought about and dreamed about electronic subjects but it was in my first year of engineering when I have gone through the book which I dreamed in my life and I started to read about the electronic circuits. As a child, when I used to see the transistors or uh any high voice systems which were playing I always thought what was the circuit behind it but it was only when I have read the books in the first year of my engineering I came to know the portal process and portal circuit which is behind, which is behind the transistors or microphones which I used to listen.
