I just finish reading uh The Lord of Rings from um by um Tolkien. I greatly enjoys his book because it was about fantasy, a big war. It spoke about um different issues that that do not exist in real but um it was um, it is a walk of imagination which I appreciate greatly. I will not say that it qualify um as a great book because the writings flow is rather heavy. However I greatly enjoy that he tried to imagine um a new world based uh on mythology. He tried to give English, England a new mythology.
