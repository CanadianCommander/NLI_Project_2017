The book called uh <%3.5> Child it is one of the uh the most interesting books that I have read because it's about a child who, whose mother doesn't uh is an alcoholic and does not care about him and he is stuck in the basement cleaning the house and looking after his family and he g-, he gets no food, he has to earn his food and he's not treated well as his other brothers. He's the youngest and he wears torn clothes and sleeps in uh in the basement in the cold weather.
