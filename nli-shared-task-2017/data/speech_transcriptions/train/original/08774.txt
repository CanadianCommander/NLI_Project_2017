When I'm away from home I most miss my race bikes, I've got two of them I'm training with them for <%7.3> and race marathons. So when I'm away from home and what I'm most likely about my home are the excellent training ground there. There are hills and flat grounds where I can optimal put on my training schedule and train theo different types of uh during sport on these areas. So when I'm away from home I've not the possibility see them so I can just run. Recently I traveled to Mexico and I had no chance there to ride, ride a race bike on this excellent training grounds, and these I miss much.
