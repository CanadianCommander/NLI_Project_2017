Well a very special opportunity that I was uh given by my parents was the chance of studying at a bilingual school back home in Colombia. Uh by studying in a bilingual school I was able to learn English <%>. And it's allowed me to pursue careers abroad uh with much bigger opportunities for advancement than those that I would have had back home and it gave me a jumpstart you know compared to others uh who have a greater age, at an older age had to learn English me being younger when I learnt English I can speak it with a lot of ability.
