To be honest I try to read all types of things like novels, magazines or poetry but uh the one I prefer be novels. I try to read magazines once a month and um I don't really read poetry that often but I would try to read a different novel every week to, one reason is to um take the stress out of my life and um distract myself from the pressure of my school work. Also I try to read uh novels and English to improve my language skills um that's basically it.
