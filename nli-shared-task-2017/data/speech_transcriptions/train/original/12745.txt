Okay, I absolutely miss friends because I love because we have a lot of things in common and maybe I have to to say that I even miss my family because I just miss uh once or twice per year to saw them and is just when when I come back to my city, but absolutely uh with my friends uh we have no my uh most important moments in my life. Uh maybe I I I have to add on this list uh too my brother of course because my my brother was my my maybe my first solid reference in my life but not absolutely my parents.
