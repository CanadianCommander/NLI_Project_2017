The special opportunity that was give to me is the clinical practice in the university hospital in Cleveland. Because um now I can get used to um how to interact with the patients and the doctors in the United States. And also I can learn the differences between in my home country and in the United States. And also I learned um there are many differences in caring patients um in my country and in the United States which it helps me a lot in my study and getting my master program.
