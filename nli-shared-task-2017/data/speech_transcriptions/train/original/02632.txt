It's very important to have a good team spirit when you're a member of a team or of a group, because yeah I think it helps the whole team. And it's very difficult when you depend on other people, when you don't have a good spirit. And uh, and additionally uh you would be very reliable uh because when you are for example on the sports team or something, they depend on you and if you don't have the team spirit and when you're not reliable, it's very bad for the whole team, not only for yourself.
