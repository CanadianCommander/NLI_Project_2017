Well, since I live in Italy, uh I think uh that will be only the uh embarrassing for me to suggest only one place or two maybe to visit. I think um maybe Florence or Venice, um or Rome or Milan or Turin. Um uh each of these cities have, has so many cultural and historical monuments. Um they they're so full of anything to to watch to know. Um it would be embarrassing for me yes and a bit awkward.
