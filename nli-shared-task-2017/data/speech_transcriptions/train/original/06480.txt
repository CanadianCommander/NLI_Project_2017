Uh out of novels, magazines and poetries, I would like to uh read magazines uh because these are basically explaining the real real time situation. Uh if I will read poem, novels I will not see the real prospect um real real time things. These are imaginative s- stories basically. Poetries also explaining the real time story but they are poet poets uh uh independent view. Magazine can can allow me to create my own views. Apart from this, I'm interested in uh car magazines and I am a particular interest so I can pursue those interests if I will read magazines. That's very I think magazines are resourceful for me.
