My favorite books is uh the one I just recently read, which is Shall We Tell the President by Jeffrey Archer. Uh I found the book very well written and uh absolute thriller. It was written in the simple and lucid language so uh not using any powerful words and even a layma- uh simple knowledge, guy with a simple knowledge of English will be uh absolutely thrilled and glued to the book till the end. Uh we are, the books was talking about uh the um, the mystery and the FBI people have been informed there is, excuse me.
