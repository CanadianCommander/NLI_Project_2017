I definitely miss my family members when I'm on, when I'm on vacation because I live, I miss lot of functions held at my home and festivals at my home. And the careful nature, caring nature of my mum and dad and my brothers and sisters everybody. And last I miss all my friends and all my folks and buddies who are there at my home who make me fun, laugh, happy and merry. So I miss all of them when I'm away from my home because they make me a lot of feel better when I'm there so a lot.
