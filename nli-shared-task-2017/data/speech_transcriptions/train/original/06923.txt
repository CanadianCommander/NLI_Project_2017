That um the last um important thing I was asked to do and where I worked very hard was uh preparing my little sister, little sister birthday. Um I was asked to prepare everything to um, to make the cake, to, to invite the people. To um to eat, to, to prepare the dinner and um uh all this in only one day. So it was, for me the first time I, I do this, so it was very hard but it was great experience because I, I, I learned to, um to do something for the first time of my life but on my own.
