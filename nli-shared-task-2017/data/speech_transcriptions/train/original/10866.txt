When I'm away from the two things I miss the most are uh my mother and my grandmother cooking and my group of friend. Uh the two women in my family are very good cookers and I really miss homemade cook and my friends and I uh we're a group, a strong group and we know each other since we're kids. So uh every time that I'm away I really miss their support uh and the trust that was build during these years and the love. Uh the confident and the trust we have especially when when you have problems.
