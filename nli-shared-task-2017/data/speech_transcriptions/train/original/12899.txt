Actually after I came to United States uh I got one special opportunity, it was uh to speech in for one of the students to graduate. Actually it was a really great experience for me yeah because you know um I learn, at the time I learn how to prepare for the presentation and also you know how to communicate in a, to any other people in English. And I think because of that my English was pretty improved.
