I was given the opportunity to go to America with my family. Um well I think it was a very good opportunity because um I learned the language uh much more. And I got a lot of impressions of the, of the country, and of the people and of the culture. And well I met a lot of people and um I'm still writing letters or emails with them. And I think it's a very good thing because um well we, we visit each other and we learn a lot more about each other's culture. And um well and the language is for me is the most important thing because um I love English and I love to speak it and so I learn it much better.
