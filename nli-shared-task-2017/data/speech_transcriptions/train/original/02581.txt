Well if friends from another country were going to spend time in my country which is Germany I would them, I would suggest them to visit the city of Berlin with me, which is the capital of Germany because the people and places are really um diverse over there, usually the people are very open minded and um with places, I mean on the one hand you have lots of cultural activities um that you can do for instance going to museum such museum such as the Guggenheim Exhibition or um you can also go to bars and clubs which has a very diverse scene. So I think it would be an adventure.
