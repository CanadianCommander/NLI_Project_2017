When I am away I really miss the presence of my father because I live with him. In fact uh my mother died one years ago. And on the other hand, I really miss also the presence of my cat; my little cat. His name is Hetura. And he always uh sleep with me at night, sleeps, sleeps with me at night. And uh um I do everything with him. We um eat together in the same dish. And uh we play together with uh with his game, with his uh mou- mice. And I really miss also my home.
