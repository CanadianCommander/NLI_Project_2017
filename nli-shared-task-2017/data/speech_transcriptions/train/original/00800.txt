For a long time I've been away from my home and I know it's a really tough time being away from my home. There are many things that I miss about my home, the most important and the most lovable thing is uh that I miss are my mum and dad. They have been really supporting, every time I'm at home they really love me a lot. Secondly, I miss about my home is the food obviously, lovely food, my room, my toys and everything that uh that uh my room, the, all my books, my novels. I used to talk for a long time with my mum. I really miss all that and uh a lot many things I miss my, at my home.
