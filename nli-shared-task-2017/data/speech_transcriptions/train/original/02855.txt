An interesting book I read was The Stranger by Albert Camus. The Stranger um I though was an interesting book not only by the story it conveyed um about this man and everything that happened to him but also because of the psychological background to the book, the way it analyzed the existent existentialism, the way it conveyed um how people can change from an existentialist position to other positions. And I think this book was interesting and not only um as a story but also uh it somehow marked how I felt uh in my surroundings and how I need to express my thoughts.
