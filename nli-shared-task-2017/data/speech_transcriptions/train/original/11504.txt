I have been given lots of um, uh opportunities regarding my training and placement in <%7.0> but one particular uh opportunity is my paper presentation done at the Schneider electric company, France. And firstly that opportunity exposed me to the technical panel, the technical aspects of looking into many problems. Furthermore, they went gave me a platform to present my ideas. It also gave me an opportunity how to uh innovate on your ideas, how to discuss these ideas in front of the technical panel, and also gave me an opportunity to share the platform with all the brightest minds.
