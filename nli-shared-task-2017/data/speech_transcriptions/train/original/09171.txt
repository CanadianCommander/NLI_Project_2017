Well I think it was a very special opportunity that was given to me was um the access to the United States because my sister lives there. And uh experiencing the life in the United States in the earlier times of my life is very important because um it changed and broadened my view of um life. And it broadened my future plans and I even had the chance to go for an internship. And uh, and of course every time I go there I have a chance to stay there and uh like a resident I had to I had the chance to stay there with a very low cost. And uh, and uh that will affect my future plans for sure.
