I think it's important for a team or a team player that he can support the team, so he has to hear on the team's purpose and uh the problems of the several members of the team, so uh, he can work with them and he can add a known, uh a known part, uh a known uh element of his, that he can support all of the teams purpose. The purpose uh should be clear for the team and for the several member of the team. So uh everybody should uh work on it and should be able to interact with the other team players. This is quite important to the team, for the team and the team player.
