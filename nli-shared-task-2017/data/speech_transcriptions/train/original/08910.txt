If I could have any job of career I would like to be uh psychologist because it's a dign- dignified profession. It's a profession where I can help others to to prepare for life, to the solve problems, to be with the families, to easy profession that involves a lot of engaging but it's a profession that can giv- me give me a lot of satisfaction to help others. This society needs professionals that can help with the problems and dilemma we work everyday like drug addictions and some problems like that.
