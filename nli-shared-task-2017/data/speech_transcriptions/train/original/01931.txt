The most uh uh important thing that the other away in uh, in the field and also when I'm not with my friend I start feeling lonesome and I miss my friends. And uh the third thing I miss uh is uh my home, because my home is uh in a very beautiful place in the countryside and usually it's not uh very easy to find uh such a good accommodation uh uh somewhere else in, in another country. Uh these uh food, friends and my home are the things that I lack most when I leave my country.
