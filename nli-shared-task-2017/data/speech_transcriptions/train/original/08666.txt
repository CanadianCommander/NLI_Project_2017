<%> an accomplishment that required me to work very hard was my French Baccalaureate because I wanted to have very very good marks so I could get uh scholarship to go study in France and because I just wanted to prove, to see how high I could also get. I had to work um till late and wake up very early because I wanted to have at least seventy percent in my final results.
