If friends came from another country to my country I would take them to the places where I'm living. I mainly I'm living in Hyderabad, Hyderabad is one of the historical place. So I will uh show them the historical places like Charminar Golconda and some other monument temples. Charminar is the main for law, so kings were ruling in the Golconda fort also, so they are both historical places and uh I will also show one of the Asia's largest theatre in our place is IMAX theatre. This gives more entertainment and fun definitely they will enjoy by showing this places in my country and my place.
