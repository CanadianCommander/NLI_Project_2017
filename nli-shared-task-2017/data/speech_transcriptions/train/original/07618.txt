I was given the opportunity to work in a firm uh for computer science and I'm studying computer science. So I can uh do science both in uh during the working time and um this, this time of my studies. Uh so I do um things I learn on my studies and I can um take them to work and work on same topics. And the theological is to learn uh at the university I can um, uh turn into practice uh while working at this firm and this is just a great opportunity for me.
