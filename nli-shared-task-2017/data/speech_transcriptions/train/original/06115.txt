I prefer to read newspapers and magazines especially magazines, political magazines because I like to be informed about what's going in the world and about actual social topics. I use more to read uh magazines than novels or poetry. Um yeah it's very important for me to be informed about what's going on and to can also taking part and discussions about news and important things in the world.
