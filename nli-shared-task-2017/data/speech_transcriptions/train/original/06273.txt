One of the opportunities I had big opportunities was to go on vacations with my family the summer this past summer. Uh we went to Orlando with my cousins that I haven't seen them for three years. Um it was very fantastic and very delightful experience. I had to share with them they have grown a lot. Also my aunt that ha- is right now sick with an illness, so I had to just to see her too. And in a very easy environment which was a vacation, so it was very relaxed environment, and they invited me to go with them, and it was really nice and it.
