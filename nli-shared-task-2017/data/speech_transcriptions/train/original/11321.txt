First I would se- suggest them to visit Berlin because it is our capital it is the capital of Germany. So they can see all famous places like the Germany iceberg and the, the Berlin wall. Of course they should visit and also <%16.6> because of it's beautiful and famous course land, I think nearly every one has to see it. A third place I would suggest them would be probably be Munich because Munich would be is um, um with it's um famous parks and English garden and so it is really a nice and pretty um town. And of course all the things in the country side or um the black forest are beautiful too.
