Well a good friend of me offered me once to help him at a film production. He himself um is a director he studied um film directing and what was important for me is because I want to be a film director, to become a film director and he offered me the opportunity to see what film is really working like. So what what else do you have to do to make a good film. And I could talk to the actors I could talk to him himself and um it was just an interesting experience to be the co-director because he allowed me to say something about the scenes and to influence something in the scenes. So it was important for me to see what my future will be like so I'm really, definitely.
