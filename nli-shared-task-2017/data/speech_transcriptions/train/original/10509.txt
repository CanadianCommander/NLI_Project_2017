The book I have read about uh, was about politics and uh the reason that why I found the book very interesting was just uh because of its uh content which is very much concerned with the uh global position of Turkey, since it is based on politics again. Eventually, it is just uh mentioning about the political structure of Turkey and the political relations of Turkey with the other countries, which are neighbor countries so overall I can say that I enjoyed the book very much because of its content and its very up-to-date uh information.
