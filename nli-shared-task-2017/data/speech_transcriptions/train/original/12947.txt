I'm I prefer reading poetry because I think uh the sadistic part of poetry gives uh develops my critical thinking and also it helps my imagination to grow. While reading poetry I always try to to write poetry on my own and it helps me a lot every day how others uh write poetry to create my own style and help me develop my imagination more accurately and perfectly yes so so because I really like being a writer. So among all these three types, novels, magazines or poetry I prefer poetry for those reasons I already mentioned.
