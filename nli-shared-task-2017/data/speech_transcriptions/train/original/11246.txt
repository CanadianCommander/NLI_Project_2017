An historical book I read uh was a his-, was a book about uh historic effects in the history of uh Italy. It was kind of a crime story but it was also combined with uh a novel and I thought it was interesting because it offered uh an insight into the topic and uh but also we could also uh enjoy reading it because there was also story around it.
