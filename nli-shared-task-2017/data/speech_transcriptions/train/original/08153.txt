A special opportunity who which was given to me was uh uh when was offered a job at uh social assistant at the UNHCR, United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees. And I think that is important for me because I had to practice more skills, and had to work with more people from many different countries which have uh many cultures. And uh it was good to me because the interviewing with uh people from different countries and different uh origin will help you to.
