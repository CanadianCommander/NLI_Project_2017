As for me, I think that uh magazines is uh thing uh which is uh world imagining in our society and reading uh because it uh stands for issue of our society of nowadays uh problems. However after I was <%> I prefer reading poetry because it's uh portraits um a personal and uh emotional uh um lines of the uh uh of life and uh I feel more uh closed to the feelings than on uh problem of the of the cities. So uh I like poetry.
