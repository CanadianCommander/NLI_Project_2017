My special opportunity was given to me was my uh entire education from my family. I start to go to school when I was seven years old. And then I continued with high school and with elementary school and I'm still in high school. And I,I have been to some summer schools and I really improve my English and I uh and I knew so- new cultures around the world and met new people around the world. And I think it was a really good opportunity for me to have and, and live for it. And I'm really happy to have that opportunity.
