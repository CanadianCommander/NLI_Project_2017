I would like to show Tokyo to my friend because I live in Tokyo and there are so many stores to shop and there are some many um things to see in Tokyo. I think Akihabara is the one which is famous place for electronic stores and I also want to show Kyoto to my friend because there are so many old temples and there are so many uh beautiful views and and also.
