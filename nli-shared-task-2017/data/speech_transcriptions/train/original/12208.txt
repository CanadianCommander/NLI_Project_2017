I would say to this friend that you should go to Frankfurt. This is a really big city. You can do nearly everything there. There are some theaters and and um there are really big buildings and things like that. Another point is that this city has a long history. Because of these history, there are lots of buildings you can visit. Another point is that there is the German um um ministerial for um for defense and so you have the possibility to visit this but not the main parts but specific things.
