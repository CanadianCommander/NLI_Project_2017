One thing that required me to work very hard is practicing piano. Uh I practice piano, I've learned play piano since I was four years old and uh at first my parents wanted me to learn but afterwards I really loved music and began to uh really enjoy learn, playing the piano but I had to practice everyday and uh work very hard in practicing every piece. And so uh I sacrificed a lot of time for other amusements that other children may have but I learn, I've earned a lot from uh practicing piano because I had the ability to play it well and uh that was very important to me.
