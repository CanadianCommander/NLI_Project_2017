When I was ten years old my mother got an scholarship. She is an English teacher so my family and, and me went to the United States. And the great opportunity was that I studied one year in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the United States so I have the opportunity to live in the United State culture the, with the native people from that country. And another great opportunity is that I took English classes when I was very little.
