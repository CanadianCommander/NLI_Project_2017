Okay so if uh I had to choose a career that I want I would like to be an architect. And to work as an architect because I, I like the idea to design more buildings. Especially because I'm living here in Chicago which is a city that is characterized by uh one of the tallest buildings on earth. Like for example the Sears Towers which is the tallest buildings, office buildings in, in, on earth. So basically I love the idea to design and <%36.8> buildings that means environmental friendly buildings. Uh with that idea I'm, I'm to work on that.
