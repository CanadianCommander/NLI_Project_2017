First of all I would suggest my friends to, I would prefer my friends to take Ooty and Kodaikanal here. Ooty and Kodaikanal are two summer resorts. All here the climate is cool and we have many places to visit, and money shouldn't <%23.0>. The main and important about Ooty is we have the biggest botanical garden here. And Ooty is home for it's climatic conditions, birds, trees et cetera. That's it.
