<%> visiting Berlin because for me the most exciting city in Germany and probably the most exciting capital in Europe because it's the only capital that was separated for more than forty years by the Berlin Wall and still you can see it's separation within the city and uh it's really a big difference between the eastern part and the western part and you can <%> a lot of sites and a lot of different kinds kinds of architecture but also in the mentality of people and and uh how they correspond with each other and it's very interesting. So my recommendation would be a trip to Berlin certainly.
