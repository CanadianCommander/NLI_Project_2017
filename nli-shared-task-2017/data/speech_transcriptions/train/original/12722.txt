The interesting books I have read is The Pinocchio for several reason. Whenever Pinocchio lied, the Pinocchio's nose grows longer so uh I can learn a lot from this book. Uh I never lie, lie because uh my nose grows longer as well Pinocchio so I worry about that. So that's why uh that's why I have really interesting books is Pinocchio.
