If given a choice uh I would like to be a sports person and I would like to play cricket for my country. This because uh I enjoy it immensely. I enjoy watching it, I enjoy playing it, I enjoy anything related to this game. And if I get make it big in this game then I would be able to earn a lot of, a lot of money also. And in our country we earn a lot of respect if we play well for a country or for a state. So that's why uh I would like to meet both the uh money and my interest by pursuing this career.
