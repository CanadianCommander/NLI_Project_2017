Uh I just read the book uh <%3.3> uh uh means something like pillars of earth in English and uh that deals with uh different themes of the medieval times. Uh at the background, the story at the background, background is in uh Florence, Florence actually and uh it combines different types of uh books. There is a love story in there and uh but there are true historical facts in the book uh which makes it uh very interesting to me because uh you can learn something about history but it's very entertaining too so this book is awesome.
