My first time at the university, my first year was very hard because I had so much to read uh in comparison to my school it was much more information I had to get uh to understand and to get in my brain. And that was very difficult but it was also very important to me because my whole life I wanted to go to university and uh so be good prepared for the job market to get a good education and after I graduated uh I want to become an accountant and therefore want to do everything I can.
