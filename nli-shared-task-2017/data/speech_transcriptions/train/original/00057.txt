Working for <%> uh company actually was a special opportunity that was given to me. Actually I get this opportunity from a friend of mine to work in this company and it was very special because of its high salary and uh the training that they provide for their uh employee. Uh I wanted to work at that because I actually needed the money very badly and that high salary would provide me a very luxurious life and would provide me uh enough money to afford to go to university. But I lost this opportunity because uh I didn't want to get involved with uh international worker.
