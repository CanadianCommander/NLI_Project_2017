If I were to choose a job or a career I would choose to be a professor at university because I think that it's a very uh nice job. I think it's uh very intellectually stimulant and I think that I like the idea to communicate my patient uh my to my students and I think it's really a great job that is very useful in our society because it's universities all the temple of knowledge.
