I would suggest my friend to make it to to my country which is Germany and beginning in the North of Germany. Um I would tell him to go to Berlin first and visit the Berlin-Brigade which is very nice and it's a very interesting interesting place. Also the city I would suggest them to go to to Colon and to visit the Colon Cathedral which is also very huge and famous and it's one of the uh one of the biggest um gothic  cathedrals in uh Europe. Um the last city would be Munich which is in the south of Germany uh which has a lot of traditional things of germany like um sausages and beer.
