When I'm away from my home, I miss um my parents and my brothers. I have two brothers and they are really cute and I always play with them and hang out with them. If I'm away, I'll be really um I'll by- I'll be by myself and I really miss my parents and my brother because I will feel really lonely. And when I'm with them, I will fell the love but when I'm from when I'm from when I'm away from them I will I won't be able to feel the love that I got when I when I was around them. I really don't like being uh I really don't like being by myself and if I'm away from my parents, I'll be really really really scared and other stuff will be very unfamiliar.
