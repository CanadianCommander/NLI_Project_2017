The most interesting book I've read is it, is in- is a book called <%5.4>. Actually this book is interesting because it tackles the, tackles the uh actual meaning of uh abuse. The whole story revolves around a mother who constantly abuses her uh child uh where the father stays look, stays around and eyes looking at him as if nothing is actually happening  although the boys shows lots of bruises. The about is uh contains a li- uh has a s- simple language, simple language truth event, which actually uh encourages us to read this story, so.
