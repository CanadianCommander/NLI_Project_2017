Actually I am not a big reader at all. Uh I don't read a lot anymore but I used to when I was younger. At that time my favorite book was Alice. It was a collection of several books. Alice was a young detective and I really liked those books because they easy to read quite <%27.5> and there were always a lot of suspense. I could never lay a book by aside without having finished to read it. Uh when I started a book I automatically finished to read it.
