Um I've read a book about <%>. My mi- to my mind it's very interesting because first of all it deals about the threat of terrorism and I think it's best today very up to date. We have the threat from the Middle East of Al-Qaeda and I think there is there are parallels between RAF during the sixties and now the threat of terrorism nowadays and it was described a little very exciting and I think it's uh important to inform you about such an important topic.
