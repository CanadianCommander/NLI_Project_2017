Um I would suggest um my friends to go to Berlin. Berlin is the capital of um Germany but it wasn't always the capital of Germany. Um it become the capital a few yeas a few years a go after the unification. I think it's a really important place to go, a lot of churches and historic buildings and um adds a very uh plentiful of culture and any other things. You can go out there well well it's uh there are living lovely place- is up to taxi drivers I think and um you can have fun there. You can go out all night.
