It's the capital city of Korea and it has many historical places, also um many uh architectural attraction centers and high technological uh buildings and many many sites to see <%> to seeing. And Seoul basically has has his history of six hundred years and it also has a history of rebuilt, rebuilding history. So it has a combination of historical um historical you know places and also technological places. It's more interesting.
