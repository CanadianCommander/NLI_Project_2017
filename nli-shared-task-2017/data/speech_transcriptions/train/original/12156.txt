In my I pre- prefer to reading magazines, first because uh for me poetry uh is difficult to understand and um the knows I don't have so much time to do to read a story like that. Uh so the magazine will always shut passages uh I can read. Second uh since I made an interest in science and related topics that I will be um the magazines milling about this category such as the scientific American and so forth. At last the magazines are always kept up to date um.
