I think a very important uh quality for someone in a team is to be able to listen to others. In this way, it's a very important social skill and you are able to really interact to find together what you want to do and you can help others if you realize what actually the others need, but for that you really have to listen. Often people just talk for themselves, but do not realize that by this they actually are not interacting with someone, they, they are not able to really build on social relationships.
