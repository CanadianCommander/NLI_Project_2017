In my last semester at university, I was given a special opportunity which was to go to Europe for an exchange period. I have been to Italy for one semester. I have completed my university education in Italy for one semester. It was a great opportunity for me because I have seen new people, new culture, and new places to see. And Italy was really amazing historic the, a lot of historic places there. Also the education in <%34.2> also very good and I have improved my Italian in Italy for one semester. It was a great opportunity for me.
