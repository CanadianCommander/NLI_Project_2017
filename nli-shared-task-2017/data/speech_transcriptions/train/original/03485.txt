I would like to be an professor of literature because literature deeply interest me since I was little and I believe that uh lit- human- humanistic or literary education is important for uh students and I need I think this kind of job is required. So I would like to devote myself into this field. And um there are not many people doing this and some are, some people are even considering that this is not humanistic or literary education is not <%> at all. And so this is what I want to do.
