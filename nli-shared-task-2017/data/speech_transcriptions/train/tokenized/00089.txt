Uh the job that I would to have but I could n't is being a soldier .
After I finished high school I wanted to join the army in my country back home .
However for a spe - specific circumstances uh I could n't and I I just uh get a scholarship from my country to come to the United States and study here .
The reason for that is that my father did not agree that I join the army he did n't want me to be there and he just refused it .
