The most um important accomplishment now that I consider was the clearing of the entrance exam to enter one of the presti - prestigious institutes in India that is the IITs .
The entrance exam is considered to be very tough almost even the international level exams and uh it requires very thorough and hard preparation .
So I had worked nearly two years to be able to get to this and uh and I was able to come up with flying colors in that exam .
Uh it was very important to me because it was it opened up success for me for my future studies and build up a strong career .
