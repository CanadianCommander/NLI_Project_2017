The last interesting book I read was uh Don Quixote and I thought it was interesting because it is a very long book and also hard to understand since in since it 's written in old Spanish and as many symbols , reflect in society and how this man who seems insane really is just , it 's he he 's a product of what he has been reading and a product of what people think is good .
And in the new society he seems like a mad man .
It 's very interesting because there are two books and in a second part of the book there is two parts of the book the second part of the book he wrote in jail .
