One accomplishment that we could very hard work from me was when I acquired my first company as a lawyer .
I 've done this a few year ago and apart from the legal framework I had to do for this , it required a lot of organizational work .
For example I had to work together with the techs advisors and with other company advisors and to collect all the information and to provide it to my client .
Uh it was very difficult to me to get all these information together and uh to slip in the role of other advisors .
