Well uh when I 'm away from home I mostly miss my family and especially my mum .
Because I do n't think anything can replace a family as far as I 'm concerned .
Wherever I 'm even in work or school uh a - anywhere , I just miss my family a lot .
Because family is a thing you can always relax with .
And relaxation is something you get only at home as far as I 'm concerned .
Because relaxation is something I just love to do with family .
And family I do n't think anything can replace it .
Because I just love being with my family and , and even at , even in terms of food , I just love family .
I mean home food better than I prefer outside .
