And uh the uh this opportunity was important to me because I got exposure to the project management methodology uh planning , execution and all that , whatever methodology is there for the project management .
And uh because of the success in that project uh I got several opportunities afterwards as a project manager uh which uh enhanced my career and uh it was very helpful for me for overall career growth .
