When I am. when I 'm away from home , I miss the homemade food which my mum makes .
I love the food a lot .
I have been used to eat homemade food for the past sixteen years , and suddenly you miss it .
I feel like okay I 'm out of home .
And I , the second thing I miss is my friends ; the people I pass with all the time .
I hangout with them , play pranks on them , have a lot of fun time with them , hangout everywhere , we party all together .
We miss , I miss all the fun and whenever that your friends state , say about their party time , the , how they miss me .
So a lot emotional type thing .
