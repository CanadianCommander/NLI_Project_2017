The opportunity that was given to me was uh to help orphans .
Uh this was a very important opportunity because it gave me uh the time and the pleasure of helping little children who needed my help .
And uh to communicate with them and to give them uh , uh some of the , of the , of the care they needed .
And uh and also to provide them with uh with love which , which most orphans really need .
And most of the uh do n't get uh , do n't get uh the , the , the sufficient amount of it .
So with this opportunity of helping orphans was really important to me .
