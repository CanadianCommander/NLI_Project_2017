I would like to live with them , but when I 'm out of home , I really miss them .
A lot of is the second thing that I miss when I 'm away is my < % > because he uh is being with us for a lot of maybe for twelve or thirteen years and I usually live with him he 's uh my on my room , he 's with me everywhere he I play with him and when I < % > I can go all of these things .
I prefer to stay with my family and with my dog , because everyone love him .
