Um I do most miss about um my home when I 'm away is definitely will be the family .
Um my family members will be the , the ones that I miss most that my hometown .
Um I live with my family members and I actually do all almost most of my activities with with them but if I live alone very far from my hometown and then uh I can not um prepare uh I can not enjoy my time with my family members as I I do in my hometown .
A second reason will be uh my friends and um I will be alone , all alone .
