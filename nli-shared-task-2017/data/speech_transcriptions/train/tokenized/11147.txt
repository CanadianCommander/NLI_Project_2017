Uh the opportunity I 've got recently is that scholarship uh I got from an American institution uh to have a graduate study in the United States .
Um this scholarship uh is very important for me uh because of two reasons .
The first reason is that uh this scholarship will provide me uh to study uh in a multinational , multicultural environment like the United States .
And for example I can ma - I can meet people from all over the world like Germany , uh like china , like Japan also .
