An interesting book that I 've read recently was written by um the famous George Orwell .
His book is called Nineteen Eighty Four .
If if the book is analyzed critically and analytically and symbolically and metaphorically too where readers can understand the book nearly talk about political views and polit - and political notions and about a dic - and about total totalitarian um nation .
And metaphorically um Orwell Orwell um Orwell really talks about Hitler and stallions version Nation .
The idea he talks about are very interesting because he reveals the society and the oppression of people and how they have suffered through the main character protagonist Winston who rebels and stands out .
