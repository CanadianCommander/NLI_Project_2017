I want to talk about a special opportunity that was given to me .
It is for me this special opportunity is to move to from Japan where I lived for more than thirty years .
That for two reasons one is it gives a great opportunity to see a lot of people , the foreign peoples other than Japanese .
The other , the second is to see the European people who have the other cultures .
That 's why or that 's why I , that special , that is the special opportunity for me .
