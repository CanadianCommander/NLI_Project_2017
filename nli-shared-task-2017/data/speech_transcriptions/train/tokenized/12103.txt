Uh usually actually I do n't like reading but I have many time I have to read .
So I usually read uh like special book for my major which is in uh forensic science .
It 's related to the criminal just so I have I 'm always like I need the about the criminal justice or the some , about the forensic science .
So that kind of stuff it is very interested to me but it sometimes difficult because you know I do n't have any background but I try to get more .
