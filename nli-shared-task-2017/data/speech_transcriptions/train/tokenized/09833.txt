The accomplishment that I worked uh really hard uh is in the nationwide university entrance examination which is held in Turkey .
Um that accomplishment um was very important for me because uh that would uh indicate which university I would enter and that 's why I worked really hard for that um for over um two years .
Uh and uh in the end uh it turned out to be good .
Uh and then I had a degree in uh nationwide and then that 's why I I 'm now in a very good university and it was n't part of it .
