I 'm from Turkey .
Uh everybody know that the Turkish delight and the Turkish dishes are quite famous around the world .
I think that is the most thing I miss uh about my home when I 'm away .
Here in London over two and a half years and other thing of course I miss my family .
I have a sister who is seven years older than me and my father and my mother also there are other persons , I really miss them a lot .
Of course the holiday time is the days and other uh important things uh it reminds me all the time uh but hopefully next summer , I 'm gonna be in Turkey and then I will spend my summer with my friends , my parents , and to eat delicious Turkish food .
Thank you .
