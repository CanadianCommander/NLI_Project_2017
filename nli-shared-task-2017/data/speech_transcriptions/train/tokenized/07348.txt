My home country is France and depending on how much time um my friend would have and depending on his interest I would recommend different options .
For example if he has probably two or three weeks or even more than that I would definitely recommend going uh to Paris and visit uh most of the museums and also to just tour the streets just to feel um the atmosphere of Paris .
And then I would definitely recommend to visit um the Mediterranean coast which is beautiful and also call the French .
And I would definitely also recommend to visit the area which is very charming and has a lot of um little villages and of course beautiful restaurants .
