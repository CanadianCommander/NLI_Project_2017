The accomplishment required me to work very hard in my life was entering the military high school .
I entered the military high school at the age of sixteen and I entered the boarding school because my mother had died in the same year and I had to go to a boarding school .
It was very hard for me too and study at the same time at that time and to accomplishing the entering examinations for the military high school .
