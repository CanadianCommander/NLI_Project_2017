First of all uh the most important things I 'm missing when I 'm traveling or when I 'm away from home is my family of course .
My family means of course first of all my wife and then my two children .
The daily regular use to talk to my wife , to spend time with my children is most important to me. furthermore , I also miss my housing , the familiarity in my housing , my rooms , my books and everything else I 'm used to have at home and at hand .
When I 'm traveling , you 're most limited to the things out of the suitcase you have with you .
There you 're missing a lot of things you have to leave at home .
