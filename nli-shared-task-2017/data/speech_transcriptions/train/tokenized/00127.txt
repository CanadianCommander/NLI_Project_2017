My my favorite book is Gone with the Wind .
I like ho - ho - the heroine of the story because because the heroine is very beautiful and she has her mind in Atlanta .
She in Atlanta , she set up a wooden in a wooden factory though and and and so uh in many in many ways , she is stronger than her husband and .
