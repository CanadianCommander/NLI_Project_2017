I 'm learning in Italy whereas I 'm studying in Italy .
When I 'm away from home I really miss my family uh because of the kitchen that my mama cooks and um for example , talks um that we have together .
The second reason I miss my home is the sea in and the beach .
I 'm also um kind of surfing and I really miss um the landscape um of Italy .
I think that um these two reasons are very important to me and probably my future I will need to come back Italy um to live with my children in the future .
