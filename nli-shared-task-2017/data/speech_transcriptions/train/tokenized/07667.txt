What I miss is when I 'm traveling is first my friends uh it 's hard to be away from the people that you like and you like spending time with them .
Also I miss uh lots what I miss also a lot is all the details such as my clothes or having my own computer or it 's all this little stuff that you do n't realize when you go home that I miss the most when I 'm away .
