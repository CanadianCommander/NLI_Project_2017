Another country I would suggest that we first visit the city because of it 's historical richness .
I would also suggest that we visit uh which is forty five minutes away from the city .
It has a lot of history a lot tales and a lot of places of interest many cultural places .
And depending on my visitors interest I would also suggest it to go to uh the Northern part of the country which has a lot of forest um many animals many ecological activities such as walking .
Um visiting main ruins and that kind of things but I would actually try to take them a little little bit around every where so they can get uh a major view of the country .
