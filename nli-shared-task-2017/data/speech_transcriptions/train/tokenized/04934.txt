Apart from the affection of my family member , one thing which I miss most when I 'm away from my home is food , especially the food cooked by my mother .
Basically I 'm allergic to any food which I eat outside , so it has caused stomach upset many time even when I was away from my home .
So food is something which I miss a lot when I am away from my home .
Or when kind affection , there is nothing like affection showed by your parents .
You miss this affection when you are away from home .
Sometimes you feel homesick but situations demand us to stay away from home sometimes .
So food and affection and affection of the family , those are two things which I miss the most away from home .
