When I go away fact I think that the thing I miss most is uh probably the , the fact that I have to , to break my habits and adapt to a new style of life .
For example if I go abroad or even if I go in on of my friends home I have to wake up and go to bed at different times , I have to be at because I 'm not in my home with my own habits .
Both uh there could be some difficulties with adapting to a new kind of food for example when you are abroad and you atmosphere when you do n't have your parents with you and you do n't have all your friends that know you very well and with whom you get at ease .
