If my friend from another country were going to spend time in my country I would suggest it would be Istanbul .
Because it 's it 's uh historical place and many , many , many beautiful places to see lots of mosques and palaces and historical buildings and uh also Istanbul is a very crowd city and it combines Asia to Europe .
So that a pretty important thing and uh great food and uh wh - what can I say it uh great metropolitan .
