I was asked to choose a quality I think makes someone a valuable member of a team .
I my opinion uh you really have to enjoy group work , you have to be a person who can speak and really who can work with other people and you have you just do n't have to work just on your own .
You 're just not an indivi - individual at that time .
You have to um be more in tin the group work .
Um the other thing is you have to interfere with others , you have to um just talk and just sit there silently and listen what the other .
You have to really interact with the others .
That is what I think is um important quality .
