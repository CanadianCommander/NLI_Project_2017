The special opportunity I was given uh is to uh take part in a big program in the city uh ne - near the place where I live .
Um the main advantage is that uh my company I work for at the moment is going to pay for that um and I think it 'll give me the uh chance for sh - for more development to um improve my skills , to meet new people and um the main point is that I will be in English so I hope I 'll be able to improve my uh English too .
Um on the other hand it will give me um an a lot of information which I can use in my job in the future so I guess I would be able to do my job much better than I am at the moment .
