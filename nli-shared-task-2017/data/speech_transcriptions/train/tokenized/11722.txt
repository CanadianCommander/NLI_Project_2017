I have um applied for a post graduate study at uh of management and I was asked to perform the take the TOEFL testing .
In order to prepare for this test I bought a book at amazon .
com , read it fully and basically prepared myself reading and listening and working through the book page by page lesson by lesson .
It was a hard work to do as I 'm ten years out of studies and I 'm want to study now again at a post graduate level .
