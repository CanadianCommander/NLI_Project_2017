Once there was an opportunity given to me and according to that opportunity I was supposed to present a paper in front of , in front of a large large number of people .
That was the first time I was going to present a paper and it was very , really I was really feeling really nervous .
But that proved a great of great help for me because it was after that it was after that when I went further presentations I was really rewarded for whatever I presented for for .
So that opportunity was the kind of mascot for me because it made me grow up my confidence in me .
