I 'm going to talk about The Culture the novel it 's a good novel because it talks about different cultures and different social economic statuses and uh the select the select people know how how different people are and how different people can suffer sometimes according to their backgrounds or to their environment they live in and that not everyone can have uh equal equal social backgrounds and equal good positive lives .
So some people suffer sometimes and that 's why we should help them and make this world a better place .
Also I would like to say that uh .
