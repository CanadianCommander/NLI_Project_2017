A very interesting book I 've read is The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera .
The main reason why I find this book interesting is that it talks about common people , people I can ea - easily associate with .
In addition to this , Milan Kundera has this kind of bright insights on behaviors and a deep understanding of the emotions that uh lay behind the behaviors .
It 's really interesting for me to read this book .
