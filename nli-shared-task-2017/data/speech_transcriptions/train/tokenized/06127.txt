When I 'm away from home the thing I miss the most is obviously my parents and then obviously the home cooked food .
I 've been an exchanged student in the US and I noticed that when you 're away truly then only you realize the real value of being at home and being pampered by your parents and having the food you 're used to from when you 're brought up like , um certain amount of spices in the food and the test of the food .
It 's , you 're just used to that and you start craving it .
And I think personally I loved , I love being at home so I miss all the comfort which I take for granted and you have to do all your own work as well .
So definitely being at home away from home is difficult .
