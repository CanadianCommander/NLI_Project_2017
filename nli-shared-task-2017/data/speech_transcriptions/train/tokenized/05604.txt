Well my husband and I um are both Canadian and he actually works for the Canadian military , and he was offered an opportunity to come um to the United States to work and we took full advantage of it .
Um he uh enjoys his job and um as uh um I came down with him uh I have the opportunity to work here as well uh as a physical therapist um as soon as I complete uh my English Competency uh Test that I 'm doing today , I will receive my temporary license to practice and I 'm quite excited about it .
