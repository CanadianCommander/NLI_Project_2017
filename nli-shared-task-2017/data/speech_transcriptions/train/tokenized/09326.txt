I like reading novels better than magazines or poetry because novels involve characters which I can imagine from the characters described in the novels .
So that we find that no well reading novel very interesting and and even novels tell us many history historical stories in the past , from the past .
The , they are written lively and they are free to read and they are frequently find in all libraries and I like it much so .
