The topics which I 've read a - read are Sherlock Holmes .
It is an interesting book , I found it very interesting especially the way Mr. Sherlock Holmes investigates the case .
Uh the with the help of cap he found , if uh , he will be able to say them , each of the person , the uh , the different qualities of a person uh etcetera .
And with such great qualities and then I like the style of detecting it very much .
That 's why I like the book of , a detective story of Sherlock Holmes .
