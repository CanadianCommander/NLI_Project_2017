In my free time I would like to go read because of a magazine because they issued every weekly and like it 's got proper fortnight or is very recently and uh it it can include lots of pictures and other things and other articles and other stuff .
And it has it it sustains the interest of the readers whereas novels and all you have to have a uh proper interest in reading whereas in a magazine you can just uh just browse through , you can just uh flip the pages , and you can just uh read something go to some information and you do n't have to have a specialized interest in uh reading in order to go through a magazine .
So I think uh in my free time I would like to something that is not requiring my proper interest in reading .
So I think I 'll go for a magazine to read in my free time .
