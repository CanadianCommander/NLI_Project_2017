I would like to be a design engineer and I really like this job , because the people in this industry create high quality electronic products , which are not only useful for us as an entertainment tool , but they also provide great value to the society .
One of the major benefits is the tools that are being build for medical facilities .
Some of this tools really help a lot of lives , they also help to make our everyday life really convenient .
And helps to solve some of the major problems that we face in our day to day lives .
I think it makes a great difference in people 's lives .
