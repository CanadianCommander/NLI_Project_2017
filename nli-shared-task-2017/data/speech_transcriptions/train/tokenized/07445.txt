Friends from another country from another country were going to spend time in Italy .
I would recommend them to visit uh Rome uh which the uh the center or the Italian history and especially of the Roman history and has a lot of uh monuments such as the uh Colosseum .
Um another city would be Florence uh that has a lot of uh culture and uh museums of hearts and especially fourteen and fifteen century and the last city would be Palermo which is uh in Italy and it represent the marriage of the um Italian and the Arab uh culture .
Uh over all I think Italy has uh a lot of beautiful cities to offer to a perspective uh visitor .
