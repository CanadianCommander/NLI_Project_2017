The thing I miss the most when I am away from home is my family and especially my father and my mother because they are very very nice and when I 'm home they treat me very very slowly and very well and do everything for me .
Also my sister because um she helped me when she she with everything she and is on that is on her hands and after that I think that I I also miss my friends , my beds and also I miss basketball because I play basketball in my in my city and when I 'm away I can play with my friends then .
 for me because < % > is uh important for me .
