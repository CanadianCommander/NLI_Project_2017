For me the greatest achievement was actually getting a really very high marks in my Chem degree at final exams .
The reason this was important was because it proved me right as I managed to do well against all the odds .
Everybody practically considered me what was through the bear mean , the bear minimum marks .
However this accomplishment proved to me that fortune in deed does favor the brave .
It took an amazing amount of hard work and dedication over a period of two to three months from my side and from the faculty side we were encouraging of my efforts and my aims .
Eventually everything did work out quite well and I did manage to score really well .
This is an accomplishment that required me to in deed work very hard .
And the reason it 's very important to me is it proved to me that I have something more than what everybody thinks I have .
