The city or the place that I would recommend to my friends for visiting in my country India will be the Central India and the city is called Rajasthan .
The reason I would recommend that place is because it 's a land of foods and ancient culture , great culture of different kings that have ruled in hat state and city .
There are many falls of different sizes and different built structures and it 's not easy to find that kind of vast variety of falls in any other city .
Other aspect of that is the different cultural uh uh bringing from those different kings .
Therefore they are .
