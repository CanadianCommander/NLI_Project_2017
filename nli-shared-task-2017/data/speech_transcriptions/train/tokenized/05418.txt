I think the quality that makes some a valuable member of a team is um the ability to listen to others .
I think in a team , be it a sports team or on a job uh a team on a on a job situation , it 's always important to listen to the others .
That makes you open for new ideas and also it makes you um think about what you yourself um uh think and according to me , this is one of the most important things to be able to listen in order to main the students stability in a team .
Uh also to avoid uh very strong hierarchy maybe .
If you show the ability to others , will also listen to you and uh the atmosphere will just be better .
