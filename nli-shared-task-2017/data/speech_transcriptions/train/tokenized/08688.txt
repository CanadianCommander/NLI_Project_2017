My work uh requires that I travel a lot .
I am travel almost a week each uh four weeks .
Uh I miss , what I miss about uh home , first the food .
I miss the food a lot .
I may go to Europe or Asia or Africa , but uh I miss Egyptian food .
Uh I miss my family , uh being able to uh have uh my meals with them , watch TV with them .
Uh talking to my friends .
Uh work is hectic , you get a lot of time to relax at home more than when you work for a week or so .
