Special opportunity that was given to me was my exchange year in the United States .
This opportunity was given to to me by my parents even though I did n't um get a scholarship so it was very expensive but yet they ga - gave me this opportunity .
It was so special because I got to live with a host family which meant um adjusting to another family but also meeting lots of new people .
And especially attending an American high school which was completely different from a German school and therefore another um challenge and new experience for me .
