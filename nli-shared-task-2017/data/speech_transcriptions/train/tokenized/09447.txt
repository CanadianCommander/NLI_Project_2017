I have read the book uh The Perfume in school time I think and I , I think this book was really interesting because it shows uh the extreme facets of a human being and uh of the , of a human in extreme isolation .
Uh he lives together with others but he is isolated and uh yeah , I , I like the , the language , the formal language and uh the descriptions of the author .
