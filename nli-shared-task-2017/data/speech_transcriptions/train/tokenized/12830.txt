One of the accomplishments uh I worked I think was when I 'm a civil engineer basically and I was working in the office but due to certain disaster management program which was initiate in our office I was asked to rule and work at the site .
It was a real challenge for me and uh I think I have tackled it really well .
I got an exposure to work on the site at the actual and learn how to interact with labor how to react interact with other contractors , other engineers and I got really I < % > to work .
So I think this was one of my major challenges in my life and uh I am proud that I have come out really well out of .
