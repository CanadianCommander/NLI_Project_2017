When I stay outside , the most important thing I miss is the homely nature of that place because it is not necessary for me to acclimatize in my home whereas it is indeed necessary for me to acclimatize in a place where I 'm new .
And also the food .
Food is a major thing I 'll be missing .
At my place , I love the food of my mother where whereas like in the place in the new place you need to get adjusted to the food which is available there , though it strengthens your uh capability to withstand any sort of environment .
