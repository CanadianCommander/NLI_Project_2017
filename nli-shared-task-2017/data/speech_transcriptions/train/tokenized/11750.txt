I believe I prefer reading novel um better than no - not uh magazines or poetry .
Um of course um I do read them but in my free time um I prefer to to read fiction stuff uh where than more than magazines or poetry which is more uh which is thing that I used to study at school .
So in my free time I may prefer to read things for my own uh things that give me my own pleasure .
