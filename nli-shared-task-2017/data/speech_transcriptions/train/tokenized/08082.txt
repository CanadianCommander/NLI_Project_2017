My country , Italy , is well known for its several artistic cities and well popul - uh uh well-known uh historical uh uh cities uh cities .
But uh I would suggest people who would like to come and and visit Italy not to stop only in Rome , Venice uh in Florence but just to discover uh little villages , hills , uh countryside and place that uh just just to follow um uh our inner uh leading a - and and try to to ex - explore uh uh outside uh of the cities .
So um travel with trains , speak with people uh try to um to follow one on uh uh leading .
