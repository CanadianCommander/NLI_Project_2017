The thing that I miss the most when I 'm away from home is the food made by my mom firstly because I found out , I figured out that whatever food I eat outside is not good for my digestion and I just usually end up having a bad stomach .
Second thing is the , I really like my mom 's food so the taste which I get in that is can never be you know filled up by the food uh by the outside food .
Uh another reason why I miss my mom 's food is because I like it very much and uh and I love it very much .
