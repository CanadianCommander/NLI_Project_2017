I think every member of a team is to be dependable in order to participate .
It does n't matter if it 's a sports team or a team at work , because people always prepare for things better .
and if one is not prepared , it will not help a team .
He will obviously not help a team .
And also in a sports team uh , the team depends on every member that he does , he does his best to the best of his ability .
Therefore uh , that someone has to be there in a certain time , at a certain time .
And therefore I think a member of a team should be dependable , dependable .
I think it 's the most important quality a member of a team should have .
