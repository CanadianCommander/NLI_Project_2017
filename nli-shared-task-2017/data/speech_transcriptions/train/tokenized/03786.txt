I like to take my friend to Beijing , also my Beijing is my home country .
Because Beijing is the uh casual central and the political central of China and uh if you uh if they visited there , uh we will uh we can go to the Forbidden City and also the Great Wall and also you know they can eat a lot of food in Beijing .
Uh that include the traditional food and also the food comes from the uh another place in China .
Uh in general Beijing is really a good place uh for my friends to visit .
It 's uh international city and also full of the traditional cultures there is really interesting and I recommend the most .
