My accomplishment that I would like to talk about is my success in the university entrance exam .
Three years bef - three years ago I have taken the university entrance exam and worked very hard , hard for that .
It was important for me in order to choose the profession that I would like to work in in the future .
Eventually , I worked very hard and in June of that year , I successful passed the university entrance exam and I gain the right to be enrolled in mol - molecular biology and genetic departments of university .
That 's it .
