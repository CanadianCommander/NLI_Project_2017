I 'm currently reading the The Twentieth Century by Howard Zinn .
It 's the last um two ten chapters or so uh his previous book uh People 's History of the United States .
It 's it comprises all the Twentieth Century chapters and he updated up till the two thousand elections with Bush .
It 's a very interesting book because Howard Zinn presents history from the point of view of the disadvantaged people uh the people that have n't had a voice in traditional history and he presents in in such a way that it 's always a story .
You 're like you 're reading a story , it 's not a boring history book .
It 's actually very entertaining and very interesting the facts that you can out of it .
