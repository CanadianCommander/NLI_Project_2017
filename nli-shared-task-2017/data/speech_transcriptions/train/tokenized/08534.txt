The quality I think makes someone valuable member of a team is trust .
I think trust make people can work together very well .
If um one member of the team trust others , uh they can um communicate to each other and they wo n't suspect to each other and um it 's I think it 's better to um work well together and um trust can make people work like one people but not just uh so many separate people so that the can get to succeed .
So I think trust is very important for a member in a team .
