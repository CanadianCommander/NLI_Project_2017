The I had was building the hydrophilic pump and I worked as a project engineer and because I have limited uh experience so far , I have lots of dif - difficult and experience many problems , but eventually uh I managed the project really well and uh I actually built a working hydrophilic pump which uh gave me lots self confidence and I felt being useful for the first of my life .
