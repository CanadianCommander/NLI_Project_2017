The book I 'm gonna talk about is called The Broker uh by Yego and I really liked it .
Uh it 's about uh very very rich man who 's basically sent to prison uh by the CIA .
It 's a short of political plot .
After he 's released from prison without knowing why uh the CIA CIA organized organized the search so they send him to Italy and then get someone else to kill him by accident .
Uh it 's interesting how he manages to escape from them .
