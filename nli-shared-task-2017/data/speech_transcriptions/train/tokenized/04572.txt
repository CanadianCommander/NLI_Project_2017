I read uh like two months ago a book called uh Vertigo by Paul Auster .
It 's uh novel about uh uh children who learns uh how to fly only to his will his moral strength .
This is an interesting book because it deals with very original subject like learning to fly and all the implication it can it can have but uh it also are some more implications , more uh lessons to learn to to the reader .
As a result it uh combines unrealistic and realistic stuff to provide um information and give back .
