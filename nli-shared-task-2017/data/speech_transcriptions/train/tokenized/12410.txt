Last year I had a very important opportunity for me .
It was to travel to the United States of America to work there .
This was a very important oppor - an opportunity due to so many reasons .
First of all it gives me the chance to complete my studying beside wor - besi - beside working .
Second , it gives me the chance to to see another world with different culture and different behaviors and traditions .
Third , it gives me the chance to improve my standard of living , and to earn more money that are , that is important for my living and for my children after that .
