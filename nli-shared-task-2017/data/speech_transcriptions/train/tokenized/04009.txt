A member of a team should be honesty .
In my opinion it 's uh very important quality for a team member because without him being honesty you can trust him and you can rely on him so if you are speaking with him , you you do n't need , you do n't know if he is talking the truth or if he lies on you and if he wants to do something for you as a team member of your team you do n't know if he is really doing what he says .
