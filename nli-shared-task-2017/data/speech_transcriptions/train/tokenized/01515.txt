Uh concerning the question what kind of reading material such as novels , magazines or poetry I like the most for reading in my free time , I can say that I prefer novels the most because a novel um is like a book that you can take with you wherever you go and read it in a couple of days , maybe in one day if it 's very interesting or take it with you over a couple of years .
Um but apart from that , magazines are very interesting as well ` cause you can um like have a short break and go through magazine for like ten or fifteen minutes and just have um out .
Poetry is I do n't really like that much and I only read them in school .
