When I 'm away I miss most about my home , my family um because I have a wonderful relationship with him and uh I miss uh the kind of food my mother can prepare too uh because I do n't like meat and usually when I 'm in a foreign country , I do n't like um at all the food .
And I miss my friends too of course because um I love spending my spare time with them and my boyfriend too and that 's all .
