Um the most thing that I miss about my home when I 'm away is my mother because she is always there for me and she is the one that encourages and um takes care of me .
Another thing that I miss uh is my bed and my pillow and my teddy bear on the side um because my bed I think , I think my bed is the most comfortable um place to sleep in and also the food because I 'm Korean .
I miss Korean food when I go away um to other countries or other places um and our overall family I guess is the biggest thing that I miss when I 'm not at home .
