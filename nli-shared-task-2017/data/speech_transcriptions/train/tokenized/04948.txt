The most important quality for a team member is mutual understanding .
You have to understand your team member .
You have to understand when they need help .
You have to solve their problem .
If you can understand your team member very well , then and then you can help them on the time .
I think that this is the best quality that make a team member a valuable person in the team and this is my own experience .
