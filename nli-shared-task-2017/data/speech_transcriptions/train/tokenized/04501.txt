If I could have uh any job or career that I wanted I 'll chose to work in the UN because uh I feel very international person .
I 've lived in many countries uh all different with different different cultures and uh languages .
And I think it would be very interesting for me to work uh in on an international career .
Therefore working in the UN would be perfect for me .
Um and further more it will give me the opportunity to meet may different people which I really enjoy and do so on a daily basis .
