Uh when I 'm away from my country , what I miss most is uh , is the food ; is the Turkish food and also my family and friends .
And also the atmosphere that I experience in Turkey .
Uh because I 'm a little bit conservative about the food and I have been in New York for example and I miss really Turkish food because I can not eat the other foods very well .
Also uh your family is the most important thing to you .
So while I was abroad I was away from my home , I sometimes uh miss uh kissing my brothers and my families , my family members .
So the most important things for me .
