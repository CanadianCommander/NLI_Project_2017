Last year I had the opportunity to go to a public Korean high school .
It was important to me because I had a chance to learn more about my Korean culture as well as learning the , the language .
Because I live in America I am far away from my family so last year while I was living in Korea and going to a Korean public high school I got to spend time with my family that I am far away from usually .
In the school I learned many things such as um Korean history and um how the students live the - their daily lives .
