Normally I work on a team uh for this reason I think the one big quality that a team leader have to must have it 's to be a really a good manager because it 's very difficult to manage a lot of people working in some topic .
Is not only the the it 's the only quality that the people have to uh have to have but I think that some more it 's a various uh of quality .
Uh like uh to be sensory and to be very to response uh all the questions that your subordinates have .
But uh for me the sum of this quality is to be really really a good manager .
