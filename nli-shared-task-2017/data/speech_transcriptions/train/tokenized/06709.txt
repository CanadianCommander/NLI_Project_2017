What I love most about , uh what I miss most about my home when I 'm away from it is that the love of my mother and my father .
My mother especially prepares meals for me which for me is the best in the world , and nothing can replace it .
My father on the other hand is my financial supporter and the one who cares about me the most .
SO that is why I love my father because whenever I need money , it is my father who comes up and provides me the financial aid that I need for the daily to daily expensive .
The other thing that I most miss about my home is the little niece of mine who is only one month old and is very loving and cute .
She is one of the most beautiful babies I have seen in this world .
