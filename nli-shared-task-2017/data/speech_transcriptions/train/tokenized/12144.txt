Um well , I 'm not the type of person who is gonna grab a book and read in his free time .
I do n't like reading very much .
But if I had a choice um , I 'm going to read um romantic or a comedy book .
Because it gonna change the mood that I 'm in , it 's something to share with myself , something to do with my free time .
Uh it also ga - puts you in different situations that you have to think about .
Um I have never really finished any book .
Um I do n't like reading at all .
But um I think reading is really useful , it , it extends the mind of one person and makes him think about things in life , important things in life .
It 's really useful .
