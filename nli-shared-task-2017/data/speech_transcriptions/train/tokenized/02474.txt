I like as , in reading material I like reading historical novels .
I like historical novels because you learn something from them .
They give you a pretty good picture of what um the historical , the political , economical and social situation was in a certain civilization in a certain period in history .
And it 's a way , as I mentioned earlier , of learning something and at the same time , it 's entertaining and it helps you unwind a little .
