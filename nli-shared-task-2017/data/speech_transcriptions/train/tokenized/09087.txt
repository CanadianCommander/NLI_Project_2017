Uh the book um that I ha - decided to talk about is called .
It is a true story about un - unknown author , which is , who is uh a thirteen year old teenager who is dealing with drugs .
And how the facts of drugs affected herself and the addiction and how it led to , the break up from the family .
Um it 's probably the , my favorite book because I can relate to how the author was feeling and it , it gives every teenager how , give the teenager the idea of how drugs is crap .
