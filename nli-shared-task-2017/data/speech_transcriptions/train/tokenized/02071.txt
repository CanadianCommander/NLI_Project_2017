Well if I could choose , I would rather to be a journalist working for a travel magazine because uh first things first , I can experience many beautiful sceneries of all over the world and second I can also um experience the different cultures .
For example if I travel to Europe or to um some other continents , I will combine their culture with mine and have um pretty new perspective on my own and uh three it has very valuable experience uh on my life and uh if I am a journalist I can also too write um the articles to my readers and to express my own feelings to them and that it is very interesting job I think .
