 is my favorite book that I 've read till now .
Uh this boo - , this book consist of many messages uh that help me uh help you in prospering in your life .
And one of the example of the messages in the , in this book are uh about Abraham Lincoln .
Abraham , it says that Abraham Lincoln , a person who uh failed throughout his life at last succeeded after a number of failures by becoming the president of U.S. and his failures might be suggested by saying that his life is very tender , tender age and later on he went on to marry a person who hated him and after that she tried for the presidential post for a lot of , lot of time .
