One accomplishment that required me to work very hard was when I joined tennis classes when I was quite young .
Tennis is always been my favorite sport and I pursued tennis for a very long time and even played it to the district and the state levels .
That was a big achievement for me because this being my favorite sport it also gave me a sense of um individuality because it 's an individual sport and I really like it a lot .
