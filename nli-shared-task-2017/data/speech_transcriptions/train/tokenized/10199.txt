An accomplishment I recognize as a as the most important has been the development together with the professor from university of the system for calculating calculus .
And it was , to me it was very important because I did n't know the , I did n't have the programming skills and which I needed and I had to develop this on the way .
But I think it was , it was great I learned a lot and the results uh were successful .
That I feel really proud of this , and uh and I 'm really happy about the uh all I learned on this process .
