Well truthfully when I travel out what I miss about my home , and when I am away is uh most of the important things are my friends and my family .
As um they really miss me when I 'm away .
I mean that 's all the thing that I used to do with them , uh for example uh sports or watching TV .
All that things which can seems really useless uh when you 're doing it on the moment .
Uh really uh missing me when I 'm , when I 'm away .
So I think that 's really a lot of simple things are missing me , and not few details but really important things like family and friends , which are for me the most important things .
