The best opportunity that has ever been given to me uh by my university , is by my university in the course of uh program uh and a visit that enabled me to uh study and travel around to Europe uh throughout uh when I complete my study .
So uh when I was in uh Holland this opportunity was important for me because uh the both the scholar academic and uh cultural aspects of this experience helped me to improve uh my uh language abilities , scholarly abilities and cultural abilities at all .
