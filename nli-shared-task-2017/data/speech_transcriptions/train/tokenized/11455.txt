When I 'm away from home , I uh the most thing that I miss is the neighborhood .
Because if you do n't know the people around you , you feel awkward in the place .
And this second thing that you most miss about is the place to hang out .
Because if you do n't know any place to hang out , it 's hard for you to make friends and spend time , spend your free time .
