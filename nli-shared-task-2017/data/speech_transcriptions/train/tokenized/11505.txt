All of the options presented that is the magazines , novels or poetry .
I most enjoy reading novels , uh not only because they are entertaining most because they are good uh source of information as well .
While magazines are also good source of information , novels present very in-depth uh knowledge in a particular domain .
For example the authors where uh authors like Author Hailey who do very in-depth research on a particular before they go ahead and write a novel give uh very strong insight into particular area .
For example one novel by author Hailey is Airports uh after reading that particular novel , I was almost familiar with how an Airport works .
So that 's why .
