The thing what I most missed recently is , is my cellphone .
I for example yesterday , I went to school when I was going to school , I realized I missed my cellphone .
So I should have , should have come back to sch - home , my home .
It 's a terrible experience .
Another example is when I need to call my friend , I found that I left my phone at home so cellphone is , cellphone is a important thing to me , but I miss .
