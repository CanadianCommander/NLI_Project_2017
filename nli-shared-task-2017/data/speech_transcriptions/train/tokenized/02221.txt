An accomplishment that required me to work very hard for was to get accepted for my exchange in the U.S.A uh with AFS .
AFS is the biggest um exchange organization in the world and my motivation to uh go abroad was that uh I wanted to get to know different cultures in the US was the land I choose because I had heard a lot about a part of it from my dad and I had to write a very long examination and go through uh various process of selection and um I prepared my English a lot in school and uh it turned out very good and uh I could do it .
