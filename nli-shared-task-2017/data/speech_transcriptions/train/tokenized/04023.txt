Something I really worked hard for was the admission test for Bocconi University in Milan city right now .
I prepared it really well , I did a lot of exercises because the test was worth fifty percent on the admission ranking .
The other fifty percent were your score from high school so it had a big weight on your admission chances and I , it was really important for me because I really wanted to study economics and because I like the subject it 's very important and very um very important and um it 's there are there are still lots to discover in it .
