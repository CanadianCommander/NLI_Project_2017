Well first of all I have to say that living abroad um brings me uh , brings me that , that I miss the most my parents at home .
My parents have the very special position in my life .
They have the specific role in my life because they support me every single that I need supporting .
For example my studies or if I have any problems , I can go to them .
They support me in everything .
Uh furthermore , they help me with the whole um households .
I do n't have to clean .
I do n't have to wash the dishes or I have , I do n't have to prepare my food .
So I do n't have to pay attention to those things .
And I can pay more attention to my studies .
