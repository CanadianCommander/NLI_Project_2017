ï » ¿ Um definitely I 'll recommend my friends to go to BogotÃ ¡ that is the main country in where I used to live .
Uh because I consider this uh the best city of Colombia , and also recommend them to go to Cartagena because is located at the coast .
And it has uh like an old city , and it 's very classic , so I 'll definitely recommend those two cities .
BogotÃ ¡ because is the capital and Cartagena .
You know BogotÃ ¡ is more for other things Cartagena is just for relaxing .
