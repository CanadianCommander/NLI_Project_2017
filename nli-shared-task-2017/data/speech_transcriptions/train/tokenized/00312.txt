A very great accomplishment of my life is to get selected in all Indian enge - engineering examination after my high school .
It was very important for me because it was a question of my career and after passing my high school I decided to go for a preparation of in this and I I always did at home so but for the coaching of and preparation for the national I had to live away from my parents and it was uh really very hard and it needed to work hard very much .
I I studied every fifteen or sixteen hours a day .
So it was really very hard for me .
