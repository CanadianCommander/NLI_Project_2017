When , what I miss the most when I 'm away is my family .
I have quite a large family of many many cousins and I have other family members .
Other thing is um our shopping especially I miss the bookshops that are my fa - my favorites and uh city that I live in and uh mostly if I 'm away from the country as well I uh speak , I miss speaking in my own language because no matter ho - how fluent you are in a given language it 's not the same as uh speaking your own .
Other than this of course I very much miss my friends um I have very good friends from long time ago and when uh we are together we have a really good time and that 's uh among the things that I miss the most .
