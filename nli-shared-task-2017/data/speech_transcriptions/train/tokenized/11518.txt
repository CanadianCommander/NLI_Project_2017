I spend most of my time reading academic books majorly reading articles in the journals or textbooks .
Uh I 'm a doctoral student in a at the university .
So it 's it takes most of my day to read all the books and follow the supplements and prepare uh course notes but uh else I like to read uh novels or books of fantasy literature .
I particularly like Tolkien 's books including The Lord of the Rings and The Scene Marilyn
