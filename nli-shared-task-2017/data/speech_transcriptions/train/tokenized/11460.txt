The material I like reading the most are magazines .
This is the case for three reasons .
The first one is I like getting different opinions about reality about story or about sports .
Second reason is that I do n't necessarily have the time to read books completely and I 'm always been used to read different types of magazine .
So I really prefer reading magazines because books sometimes are they bit bore and too long to get into .
