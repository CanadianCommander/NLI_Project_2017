Well , when I 'm away I most miss my family of course and my family uh especially my mother , I 'm an only child I do n't have any brothers or sisters so I 'm , I need affection very much and they are looking after me very well .
So I feel this miss my family a lot .
And second I miss my cat , I 'm really accustomed to my cat and I , I like my cat very much .
So when I 'm away I want to be with my cat all the time .
My mother and my cat are the most important things for me I guess and when I 'm away I miss them a lot .
