A very interesting book I read is The Lord of the Ring .
It 's like fascinating how this journey of the hobbit through the country and like the way Tolkien describe the whole atmosphere of the book , how the country is in war and because it 's very nice descriptions of landscape , bird and hobbits < % > um the it is also a very interesting worth writing , like whatever .
