Um if I could choose a job I would be a publicist .
I 've uh , I 've heard a lot of interest and publicity since I 've been very young .
And uh I think it 's a very interesting career where a lot of possibilities are offered uh and public um , in public domain but also in uh jobs and things such as companies or uh or schools for example .
Um I 'm planning to study mass communication for this uh because uh it is a very interesting um domain .
And um I think publicity affects everyday life and I am interested in working in something that people will realize is important and that people will see um .
