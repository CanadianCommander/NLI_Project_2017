If a friend from another country come to visit me , I will , I will definitely recommend her or him to visit two cities .
Firstly , Cusco which is a very known city from my country which is very important from an historical perspective .
Secondly , I will recommend this person to visit Arequipa , which is one of the most beautiful cities in Peru .
Uh once a friend visited me , I took her to Arequipa and Cusco and she loved this two places particularly Arequipa because of the beauty of the scenes and the people .
