I find that reading Russian novels is very interesting .
I really find them amazing because they talk about very complex people in an environment that expose them to so - situations .
The people in those novels uh often experience difficult in their familiar in their families or in their works in their jobs and they , they solve their problems in very different ways from each other and different from the way that people usually solve their problems in the present time and in this and in this country .
So is is a way to expose me to the to the way that very different people think about some something that happen to them .
