Well mostly when I 'm away from the home I uh mostly miss my bed ; my pillow and my bed .
Because uh they are my pe - personal equipments and I feel comfortable with them .
And secondly uh surely the parents and because uh you can share all your uh moments and all your feelings um at the same time and without any having communication unit and uh search their responses and understand what they feel about that subject also .
And also the bathroom uh because I 'm so difficult about problems ; that 's why .
