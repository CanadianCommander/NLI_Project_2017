Um , wanted to get a lot of money um from a scholarship and so I had to work very hard to get all the information they needed to have from me .
Um I had to write several pages of information about myself , why I want to study and lots of other details .
Then I had to get some um some papers where other people tell , uh write about how good I am and that I have and that I should get this scholarship .
And I had to work very hard for school because I needed to have very good uh notes in my A-level and yes I reached it and I was very happy when I got the message .
