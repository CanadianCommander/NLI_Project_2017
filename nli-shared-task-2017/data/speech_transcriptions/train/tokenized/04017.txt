When I think about my home I miss many things .
I miss the care and affection and love shown by parents .
I build a responsibility in choices when we move away from the house .
And the love care and affection shown by the parents will not be shown by the other people outside .
And the protection given by the parents will not be given and we have to protect ourselves and I have to assume the responsibility and feel the responsibility for my life , I have to feel more individual .
So I miss many things caring , joy , happiness et cetera and the memorable moments I shared with my home and my family members .
