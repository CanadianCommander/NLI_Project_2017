These are the three things I miss most when I , when I 'm away from my home .
The first one is the food they are cook , cooked by my parents .
Because I , I am not really an experienced cook therefore I ca n't really cook when I 'm a way at home .
And second is the good hosp - hostility , hospitality what I have at my own home .
Because I , I fear that I wo n't be able to afford good homes as I used to at the away .
And lastly , lastly the good friends I have who I can go , go out to have a drink or anything .
