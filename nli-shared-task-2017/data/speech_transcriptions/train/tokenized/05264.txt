First of all , I would recommend them to visit Mexico city because it 's the capital of Mexico .
It has a really beautiful cathedral and uh most of Mexican goes there .
Also I would recommend to visit Guanajuato , which is a beautiful city near Querétaro .
And uh Querétaro obviously because it 's the city where I live .
Querétaro has not a cathedral but it has beautiful churches , it has museums , interesting places .
