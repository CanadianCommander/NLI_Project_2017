That I have read , interesting book that I read is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas .
It talks about um the world and that he is an concentration camps to the eyes of a nine year old .
Um he is very innocent and he does n't understand what 's happening around him and he um described the cruelty that and planned on the concentration camp the prisoners and that we feel sympathetic towards the prisoners and um you feel the innocence of the child uh who is describing the prisoners , you feel the innocence and the cruelty at the same time .
And that 's why I think it 's an interesting book because it 's really nice .
