When I 'm away , um there are some things that I really miss .
Actually it 's , above all it 's my friends .
Um and for usually I 'm traveling , not alone but in small group we 're together with my girlfriend and so and yeah , I miss all the people tha - that are usually around that I have contact with and so on , but it 's not on not only the people , it 's also the surroundings because at home , uh everything is so usual and away .
The things are new and unknown and okay so and uh interesting okay and attractive but uh on the other hand side , I like the feeling of uh being in uh su - uh surrounding that I like it .
