The thing that I miss the most about uh home when I 'm away is my family and my friends as I 've been staying with my family for about over twenty years now , whenever I am away I really miss my parents a lot .
Another thing that I miss most is uh the food , the home food because I 'm so much used to eating home food at uh my home uh prepared my mum that I 'm very much used to the food and the type of food that is being prepared .
So whenever I go out I tend to have problems .
Uh I just eat the new food and their eating habits .
Another is uh another thing in my home is I can live life on my own terms .
