About a year ago , we had an international conference at the University of America in Santa Fe and I had the opportunity to meet several s - speakers from around the world , Australia , Canada , England , you name it .
And the reason this was an opportunity is I got the chance to meet people from different cultures that have all invited me to visit them personally in other countries , something I think I 'll probably take up as soon as I can really .
Um I think it 's really great to be able to travel around the world so that 's my special opportunity so far .
And I 've also made great friends so , cool .
