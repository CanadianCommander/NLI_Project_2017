In this question , I have been asked to describe a valuable quality of a team member .
Well , there are so many important uh qualities uh important qualities to have in a team member but most important quality thi - uh quality which I uh is the honesty .
Uh honesty and trustworthiness are two important things uh which a team member should have .
Uh if uh a team member is honest and trustworthy , it can fos - uh foster the mutual understanding between the groups .
And not only this , it will also help to help the uh team to grow as a unit .
Uh more important is uh within the group , it also help us to understand each other equally well .
So I feel that honesty and trustworthiness is is the important quality for a team uh to have .
Thank you .
