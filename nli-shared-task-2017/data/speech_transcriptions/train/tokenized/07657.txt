If my friend is coming to Mexico I would tell her to go to Oaxaca .
Why Oaxaca ?
Because it 's a really beautiful place .
It is um it has a very delicious food , it 's a very ru - uh cheap um city or place to spend your money .
And also and the most important thing I think so , is it has a lot of history over there , Because it has a lot of archaeological monuments , and it 's also rich in terms of nature .
The people is really nice and I think it 's the best way to spend very enjoyable time in Mexico which is Oaxaca .
