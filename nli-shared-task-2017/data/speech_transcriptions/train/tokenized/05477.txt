Same occupation I am in right now , which is physical therapy .
Physical therapy gives me the opportunity to help people , but not just only to help , but to help in a correct way , which means that I got a huge knowledge about medical um that I have huge medical knowledge and I that I got a huge a background and not only the anatomy bases , but but with a physiology and functions of the human body .
This is what my interest is about I really like um integrate all the things that I love to do into my daily uh work and I love to work with people and um this is what I would always do again .
I would always make the same the same decisions .
