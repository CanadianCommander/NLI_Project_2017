Well that I really appreciate and what I ere - really like when I go to visit a place is the architecture and uh the stages of ancient cultures .
All that I strongly recommend because I really like and I really like a place for a friend is to go and to visit Cartagena in the North side of Columbia in front of the Caribbean sea .
With the ancient wall that cover the old city that is really amazing and uh can enjoy the beach too and a lot of uh places for shopping .
So you can find a lot of things not only the good old things but shopping in the beach .
