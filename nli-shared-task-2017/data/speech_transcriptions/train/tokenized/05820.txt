Interesting book which I have read and that interested me a lot is The Village by the Sea which is written by Anita Desai .
In this book Anita Desai portrays a poor family living in a village .
In this family , the father and mother due to the economic reasons uh are quite poor and live in poverty but the children take up the task of bringing up the family and to help the , themselves come up .
So this uh story basically talks about the hardships which are faced by these poor children and the courage with which they face these hardships and take up whatever comes to them in life .
This is what inspired me in this book .
