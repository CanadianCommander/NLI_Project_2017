Well first of all I would like to bring them to Venice .
Uh Venice is the closest city to where I live and is uh , I mean touch of uh uniqueness because of the way it is uh conceived .
And um second or I would bring them to Rome because is uh the center for human say history and uh some uh where a city that you can not miss where you are for Italy .
And then at the end maybe it enables and easily to enjoy the beautiful Tyrrhenian Sea and uh warmth of the southern Italian population and why not enjoy some great food where home made and homely made why not .
