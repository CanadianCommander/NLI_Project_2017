While I 'm away from home well I guess what I miss most is firstly the habits I could have uh when I 'm in Paris and uh so the uh I just do n't have the same habits .
I 'm just completely disconnected uh world and living in another one .
Uh secondly , I 'd say I miss my family , uh my parents , my sisters who are at home and that miss me that I miss them too and finally I 'd say I miss my friends for when I 'm away from home I most frequently go go away from my friends too .
