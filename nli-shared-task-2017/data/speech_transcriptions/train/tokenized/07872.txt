I feel that one big accomplishment on my part was being clearing the joint entrance examination for the admissions into the Indian Institute of Technology .
So I 'm currently pursuing Computer science from out there .
The fact way ways it was very challenging is that we do lack uh students appear for this test and it requires the whole syllabus of the secondary classes and not even those syllabus from the book but you need to test deeper into that and actually read much more .
The accomplishment was important because it actually helped me shift my career .
Today I 'm going to look I 'm looking at research in Computer Science and Graphics .
So if I had not been here , the faculty was could not have been good and hence the decision could have been different .
