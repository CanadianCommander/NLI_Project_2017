I 've been reading newly a book about um this privileged person who came from South America , he 's actually a Venezuelan and um I found a book interesting because um his biography is is really interesting .
He 's been to many countries on around the world .
He 's been a conscious person , he moved in many political movements and social work , and then he had really interest life of like many loves and then he met lots of other people around the world and then now he 's known by everyone who 's basically is into politics .
So that 's why I find interesting because that 's the kind of life that I would like to have .
So I 'll be still reading it more and more .
