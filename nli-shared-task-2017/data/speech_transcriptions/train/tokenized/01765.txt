If a friend from another country were going to spend time in my country I would suggest him to visit Geneva , for many reasons .
First of all Geneva is a beautiful place , you can go to the lake of Geneva , visit gardens , take a boat and see the lake of Geneva .
Moreover Geneva is a really interesting city , in fact you can go to museums or places like < % 33.1 > in Geneva .
Finally it is a relaxing place because there are mountains , it is very quite .
So if you want to relax it is very good .
This is one of the reasons why I would suggest to a friend to come in Geneva .
