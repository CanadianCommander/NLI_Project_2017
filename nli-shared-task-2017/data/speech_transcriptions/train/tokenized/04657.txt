I 'd suggest a place that if it 's uh in my country I would suggest my friends visit uh Rome first for its uh greater history because all the most important monuments in Italy I think uh can be seen there .
For example we have the Colosseum and so on .
Uh furthermore I would suggest to visit Venice because it 's the most romantic city in the world as everyone says .
Uh you can go uh to museums also and see many things you wo n't see anywhere in the world .
And last I would suggest to visit Milan made in the fashion way because it 's really fantastic you have many things to see and to do .
