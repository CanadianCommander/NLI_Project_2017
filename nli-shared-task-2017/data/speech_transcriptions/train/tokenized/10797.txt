I think an important quality for a group member is self-confident with self-awareness .
A group member should know that he can improve something but he should know that he is not too important , that the team is important , that he needs the other members of the group to do something to to to to improve something but he has to know that he is important too .
That everybody in the team is important and um yeah .
