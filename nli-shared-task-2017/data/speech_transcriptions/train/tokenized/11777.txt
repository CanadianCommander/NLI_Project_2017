The quality which I think is most important to make someone a member of , as a valuable member of a team is first of all that he should be a compatible person .
The , when I say compatible I mean that , he should have a you know uh a goal which is common with other people , and he should be working towards that similar goal .
The other person that he should be more receptive , and should have uh more , more tolerable attitude towards other .
Because different people will have different uh opinions , and uh the other person should be able to respond to that .
And the third and most important thing I believe is that , that person should have the same goal as the rest of the team .
