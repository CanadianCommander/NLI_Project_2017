One of the most interesting books that I have read is The Catcher in the Rye .
The protagonist of the book Holden , Holden Caulfield as he 's called as been through a number of school and has been traveling to the schools regularly and suddenly one fine day when he traveled to the last school , he goes for hitch-hike in the New York City and meet few interesting people .
The reason I like this book specifically more than any other is the interesting characters that has been portrayed and the way he meets it looks very real and I can associate myself to the protagonist uh not necessarily because he dropped out of the school but more primarily because of his adventurous nature .
