Sweet uh if my friends from another country were going to spend time in my country like which is Turkey I would suggest that they go to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul .
Like its just full artistic places and objects there they could do shopping and other stuff .
And I would suggest that they go to Saint Sophia which is a mosque , but now it 's actually a museum they will definitely love it 's beautiful .
And they should take a maybe a see , see in the middle of two two countries which is Europe and Asia .
