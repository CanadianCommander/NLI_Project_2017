I was given the special opportunity on the working ground over a year ago while I was living in uh South East Asia .
I had moved over there with my husband who was working for the United Nations , particularly for the World Bank .
And uh I was not working and a possibility came up to work in a great project for UNESCO .
It consist of working with uh local counterparts in helping community people to create different activities that would lead to improve their living conditions .
It gave me a chance , not only to work with the United Nations .
