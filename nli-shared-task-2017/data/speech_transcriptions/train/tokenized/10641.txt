Well , one accomplishment that required on me a lot of work was uh was cooking dinner I hold two weeks ago for the family and some friends .
It was , was the anniversary of my mother and I wanted to make a big dinner so I could get everybody gathered in a room and have a really good time .
I love cooking my mother used to tell me how to cook ever since I was a little child and uh I wanted to maker her fifteenth uh anniversary very special .
So uh I mean a lot of time I used the whole morning to do , go some shopping to get the , better products I would use and uh then it took me all afternoon to prepare the dinner for seven persons .
