If I could have any job or career I wanted I would like to choose computer science , because I really like computers and I really like being around them .
I really like them since the first day my family bought one for me it was like , it was like uh , like six years ago when I was back in middle school .
And I started like playing with them , doing research doing my homework , typing stuff .
I really like and I enjoy and I want to like I want to be a computer science teacher or co - computer programmer when I grow up to help the , to help the children like to play and .
