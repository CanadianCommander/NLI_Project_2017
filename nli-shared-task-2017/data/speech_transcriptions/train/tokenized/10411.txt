Uh I read a very interesting book about Albert Einstein by Friedrich Durrenmatt who is a a Swiss author .
Um he wrote the book in German and first I 'd like to talk briefly about Einstein .
He was not only a very famous intellectual for his theory of relativity but also in politics and he had a major influence on the Second World War when the atomic bomb was launched which which he could n't prevent from happening .
And then also it 's interesting to know that Einstein comes from a culture background that is extremely diverse and he was able to very much integrate himself to wherever he went um for example the US , he very fascinating personality at all .
