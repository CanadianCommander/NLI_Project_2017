Uh uh book I want to talk about is uh called is uh The Art of War by Sun Tzu .
It 's my favorite book .
It 's a very historical book uh and uh what 's really amazes me is that uh the book uh the , the man called Sun Tzu was a old Chinese general who lived uh like uh tho - uh two thousand years before uh Christ , I do n't , I do n't really know the real uh date but the book is amazing .
Uh the man talks about the real art of war , the rules applying to it and uh it 's really uh amazing to see how those rules still applies today to the every aspect of life like politics and uh you know , the everyday things you do .
