My most interesting book I have read was Opera History .
It calls Opera History because not only my major is Opera and singing but also it , it 's very useful and uh excited .
I could find how the Opera was created and which kind of opera was composed and performed from , from the beginning of the opera and from then up to now .
It helps me ve - find , it helps me to find very new things like who make the first opera and how .
