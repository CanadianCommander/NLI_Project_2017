Grade school I had the opportunity to go to a foreign land for one year to live there .
So I went to Mexico and lived in Guadalajara , stayed there with a family and went to school there .
This was a very good experience for me because I had the opportunity to learn foreign language , I learnt Spanish quite well there and also I was able to experience a culture I did n't know by then and I could meet many people .
I learnt a lot about the land of Mexico and also a lot about myself , how I behave in an unknown condition .
