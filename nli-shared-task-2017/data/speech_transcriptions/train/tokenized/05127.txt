Mostly I miss my old social context my friends and my family .
It 's not so much the town and the city that I miss because uh in each city I can feel very comfortable and I can feel at home .
But it is the social context of people I know that make the city uh uh to uh to be homelike for me .
Uh the time when I went to school it was very long time .
I took very long time to know some people very detailed uh that 's very special .
