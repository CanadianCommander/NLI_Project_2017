I think the most important quality for a team member is the ability to communicate and cooperate with each other .
When do when doing the work project they should work together and it requires you to think about others and the whole team rather the individual .
I can remember that when I was doing my design project , there were four people in our team .
We listened to each other and helped each other and each of us took took charge in one part and our project is a successful one .
