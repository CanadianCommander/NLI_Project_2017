The book that I think is interesting is .
I read this book when I was five years old and I thought this is really exciting .
I was very excited to read that book because the book provide me uh a large amount of details about what the life is like in uh , in island .
Another thing is the book gave me imagine the , how Ronny , the main view , he escaped in the island by himself .
So it really excited for me .
