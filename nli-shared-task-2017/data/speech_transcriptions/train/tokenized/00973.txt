A special opportunity for me is given by parents because like uh I like they gave me this opportunity to study in the United States and I can get my second degree uh in the United States .
And moreover , I can learn the culture different for example I know if I go to the restaurant I have to pay the tips for the uh is a kind of < % 26.9 > so is very good for me to learn the different culture when , when I study in the United States .
So I really appreciate my parents who gave me this opportunity to uh expand my vision .
Yeah that is it .
