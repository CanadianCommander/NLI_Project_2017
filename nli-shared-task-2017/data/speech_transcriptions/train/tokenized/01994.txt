The thing I miss the most when I was away from home is uh the food of my home and my parents and the shopping mall near my home .
I like Chinese food very much so when I was in Europe last year I was so um I I missed my the food of my hometown so much and also my parents .
I went to America last year for ten month as an exchange student and during that time I missed my parents so much because they always help me a lot and also shopping mall because I like shopping very much and is a good way uh release stress and when I was stressed out I like enjoy shopping and there are so many good stuff in China too so .
