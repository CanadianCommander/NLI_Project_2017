Enjoy a lot Lolita and that book of Lolita because um it 's a fascinating book even though the content uh the plot itself is very shocking , the book is great because it 's very ironic and even funny .
At least I read while I read the book .
So I think it 's a mistake to uh leave out the irony of the book once you 're adopted to the movie screen .
As for instance Aidan Layne does in his movie adoption of Lolita .
I prefer a copy of adaptation of Lolita because it 's it 's it been made a comedy .
You know the book is still a comedy while Aidan Layne adaption becomes a melodrama which the book definitely is n't .
