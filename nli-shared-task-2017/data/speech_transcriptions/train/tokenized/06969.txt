I suggest that my friends invite them to come to my country , Egypt , I suggest they uh visit Alexandria uh and not go to Cairo because Cairo is very crowded .
Alexandria is not crowded .
It 's very uh it 's very huge country .
The transportation it 's ve - very easy to transport in Alexandria .
And they can visit the library .
They can swim if they like to swim in the sea , Mediterranean Sea .
And they have they will find friendly people .
They can ask any people what whatever they want to do but I do n't I do n't just uh advise them to to go to Cairo .
It 's very crowded over there .
