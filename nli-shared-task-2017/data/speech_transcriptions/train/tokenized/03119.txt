They must really when I 'm at home and my family , my mom and dad especially all the time .
So when I go it 's um usually my mom , my dad and my brothers or I meet them on the evening when I 'm back home .
Since I 'm working also I miss a lot my room sitting in my room watching TV , reading a book , uh relaxing , do whatever I want , wear whatever I want , eat whatever I want .
Another part um another um important thing that I miss is talking to my friends since usually .
