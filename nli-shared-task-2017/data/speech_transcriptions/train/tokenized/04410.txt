April this year I got the opportunity to um go to California with a friend of mine .
She comes from California and she want to visit her family and so um I travelled to California and had the first trip on my own .
It was a really nice experience because I plan it all by myself and I visited so many nice places in California and even um I went to , I even went to um Arizona and saw the Grand Canyon .
It was a really breathtaking moment and so at the end of my trip I um went home to her family to San Francisco .
It was a really nice time there and I could um yeah see how it is to live in an American family .
