I think to uh university was my biggest accomplishment that required me to work very hard .
Uh in Korea , getting in to a good university is very important and I was a very poor student .
Uh this is because I lived in America when I was young so I only focused on learning the language and focused on other things as well than on my studies .
So the more I did study , the more difficult it became to catch up but I met a tutor who motivated me to study .
So last year in my high school I studied very hard and concentrated on my study.n Um as a result I got accepted in a university uh with high score so that is my biggest accomplishment .
