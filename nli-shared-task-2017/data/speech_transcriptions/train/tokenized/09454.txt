The interesting book that I 've ever read is the Wings of Fire .
This book was written by APJ Abdul Kalam , the president of India India at this now at this moment .
In this book he had written many of his practical experiences .
I like this book most because it tells , for example it tells us more example , how his life was affected by the small incident in an airplane while uh he was preparing .
This b - this book tell us about many different things , so I conclude that the Wings of Fire is the best book written by Abdul Kalam that I have ever read and I feel I have learned a lot through this book .
