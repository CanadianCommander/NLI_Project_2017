In my psychology cla - psychology class I had the opportunity to make a presentation over the uh uh why to save the nature resources .
That opportunity was important to me because I really like to uh see the nature resources resources because they are important for our future and the other thing I I feel it was important because it gave me the opportunity to present myself in front of other people , in front of other class which is big difference to me and I can and after the presentation I found myself more confident because I did it in a nice way .
