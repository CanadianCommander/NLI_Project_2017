Most about I miss when I 'm away from home I miss my cat because w - from the day I born until now I 'm in the college I take care of her .
I feed her , I take her with me outside every evening and all is when I 'm stress nervous I always play with her .
She relax me and I make sure that my mom at home she is not alone because my cat it 's also a remind her on me whenever she saw her she remember me , my mommy .
