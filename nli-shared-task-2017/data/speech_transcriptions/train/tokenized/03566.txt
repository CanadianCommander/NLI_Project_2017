In my opinion it 's very important to communicate within the team , so a team member has to have the ability to communicate with the rest of the team members .
It is also very important to be motivated so within the play or the game you can cheer up whenever someone is down or is n't satisfied with what he did .
And yeah it 's , it 's very important to play together to achieve a goal and to be open to adjust , and to put everything into the game what you 've got as a player .
So that a member plays in a team and not for himself .
