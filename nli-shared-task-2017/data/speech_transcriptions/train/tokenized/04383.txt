Scary and as well as romantic novels .
Scary scary novels keep me pinned down to my book .
They make it a , there 's just page turners , they 're very interesting and you never get bored with them and if you need a break from all the scary stuff then you can just read a romantic novel which is easy reading and it 's like reading and you can read it at anytime of the day .
It 's not something you need to pay a lot of attention to .
It suits you and calms you and yup , that 's about it .
