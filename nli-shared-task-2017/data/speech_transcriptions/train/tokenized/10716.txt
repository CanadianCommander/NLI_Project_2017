I think um having respect someone makes somebody a valuable member of a team .
If a person um shows respect to other people he can show or demonstrate that he 's willing to um incorporate other people into decisions that have to be made .
A team member has to be um helpful because um if other team members are not as strong in character or in um or are not as compatible in what they are you can help them .
A team member has to be strong has to have a strong personality because he has to uh yeah combine knowledge of everything .
