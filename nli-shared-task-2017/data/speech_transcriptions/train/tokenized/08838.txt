The most resent s , special opportunity I 've had was to go the National Conference of the Biomedical Engineering Society in Chicago , um as a board member on the BMES uh society at University .
And I was able to apply and to be awarded a trip to that conference in Chicago .
And to meet people from different universities and hear about research that is going on within the Biomedical Engineering field , at those places .
It was a great opportunity and now I am very motivated to apply to a grad school now that I know .
