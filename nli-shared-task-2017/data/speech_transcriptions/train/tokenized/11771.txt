Kane and Abel was a interesting book which I read uh for basic reason why why they interested me was it 's the writer 's writing ability .
It was easy to understand and there was no tough words to understand understand .
And second reason why I like this book was it it had all the aspects of life and the success how man can achieve .
For example in this book it was mentioned uh mentioned how they make money with the usage with the knowledge that we chase .
