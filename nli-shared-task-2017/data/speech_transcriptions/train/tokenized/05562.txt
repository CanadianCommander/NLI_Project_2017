The thing I miss most about home when I 'm away is my family .
Uh I love my family a lot and being away from them does not make me very happy .
Um the second thing I miss when I 'm away from home is uh the security you get when you stay with your family .
Things that you actually take for granted when your family is far away from you , I mean you can not take it for granted then .
For example uh I know if something goes wrong , I can always rely on my parents to take care of me but when I 'm away and I do n't have that kind of confidence , it shakes me up a little bit .
Also , as silly as it sounds , I also miss home food .
I 'm crazy about home food and I 'm not particularly fo - fond of the food you get outside .
For these reasons , I miss my home a lot and I miss my family .
