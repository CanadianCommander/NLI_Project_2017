The special opportunity that was given to me was the , the chance to be to live in United States after the half , a huge sailor in Italy .
After then I failed for two times in a raw the same class .
And when I got here I 'm realized how the real , how the real life works and how is in , is really important how you manage your time and how you manage your money .
And also I realize how important is your family because when you 're not with then and when you 're missing then and but you do n't have chance to go back , you truly realize how much you love them .
