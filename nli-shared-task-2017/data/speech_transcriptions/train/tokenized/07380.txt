Whenever I 'm away from home , I especially miss my family and all the support they give to me and the I miss uh I miss them when I could get home back from work and I I need someone to talk about what happened to me during the day and my problems and I also miss food because nobody cooks like one 's mommy 's .
So and and I I also miss uh the easiness when you 're home , it 's completely different than from you 're different to when what you feel throughout or . '
