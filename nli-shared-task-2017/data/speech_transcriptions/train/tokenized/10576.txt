I think the best quality a team uh member should have is is ability to work with uh other people .
This is an important quality given the task in most cases requires working in a huge uh um constrain across different type of people .
You might be working on a team so one should have the the right um flexibility of people in trying to work across different um types of people and sometimes you run across um either issues among teams that involve uh poor team chemistries and so having flexibilities of team patten .
