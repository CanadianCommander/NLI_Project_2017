Uh when I stay away from home for a relatively longer period of time , it could be about a month or so , the thing that I 've missed the most I should say is the food that I get at home .
Uh we a tradition of home cooked foo - eating home cooked food which taste better than what you get in the ready made market and that is something that I miss .
Another thing that I really miss is the company of my parents , the way we interact and how I can uh be of assistance at times and vice versa and of course then the fact that the comfort that you get in at home can not be compared to what you get maybe in a hostel or a living place .
These are some of the things that I really miss about my home .
