My hometown is a little village in Saxony .
So uh we have there a lot of wood , a lot of nature and so on .
When I 'm away from there , I miss all the possibilities to go out into the green woods , to uh go swimming in the lakes and so on .
If uh I 'm in Berlin , I have a very really big city with many options but uh I miss the green .
I miss uh all these little uh nice moments in in the wood when you 're around you look up to the sky , to the sun and um you have the opportunity to uh breathe very uh clean air and so on .
