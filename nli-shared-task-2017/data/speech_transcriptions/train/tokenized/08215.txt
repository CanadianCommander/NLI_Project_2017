Um I recently read a book written by it 's about vampires and I love the book very much because , it describes every detail with lovely description and historic detail and I love the story which is why chose this book in the first place .
It talks about Venice , Florence and many parts of the Middle east and how they were long a long time ago .
And also that I have a good uh um small interest in vampires which sounds very weird .
But um in the story she makes these vampire with no souls had so much love had so much care and she talks about how he paints these fantastic paintings and talks about all the artist of Venice and Florence .
It 's quite amazing and the way she writes these things makes you really imagine that you 're in the story .
