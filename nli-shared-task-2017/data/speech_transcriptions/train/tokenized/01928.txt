If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country , that 's Italy , I would suggest them to see Turi and Pima .
That 's actually the place I , I come from .
Uh the reason is uh first of all the big variety of landscape you , you have lakes , you have mountains .
You have towns , you have the , the po - uh um river .
And another reason is um they , they uh should also join the towns there .
And Turing as the biggest on it has uh very old , it 's a very , very old town .
It has a , uh big museums uh in the town and the town is really enjoyable .
