If I was given a change I 'd uh consider going to computer programing which is my choice of a career because I think it gives me uh kind of pay uh , a feeling of what I really I 'm uh a technical person who is actually more into Science , Mathematics and Physics .
And I can basically understand the laws of computing and applying my thoughts into computer programing and use it as a profession .
Um use uh computer programing to gain um a good professional career maybe advance in it um .
