As a scholarship student I uh not very much time to engage in extra curriculum activities or go on holidays .
However this summer my father gave me the opportunity to dive in Red sea and uh work as a dive guide there .
I was fish identifier there and uh before uh going there I was trained uh for various kinds of fish .
And uh this was an opportunity for me because uh the Egyptian people who I met are fantastic .
I have to uh , I was engaged with uh not only people but also with under water duties , so it was dif - uh fantastic opportunity for me given by my father .
