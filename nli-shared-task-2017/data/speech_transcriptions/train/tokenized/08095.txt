If I could have any job I want I would choose to be a business woman because I think being a business woman can earn me a lot of money .
Earning a lot of money , I can have a better life , I can buy anything that I want so that I can have a better material life and I can give money to my parents , to travel around the world and let them buy whatever they want .
Also if I can run a large company , I can have a lot of money and I can meet a lot of business men and then making .
