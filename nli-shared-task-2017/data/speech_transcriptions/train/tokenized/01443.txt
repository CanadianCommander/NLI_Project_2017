Uh this is quite complicated because I actually do n't read that much unless I find some time to read I prefer magazines and information .
Maybe natural science information or things like that .
Um I do n't know why but books and fantasy stories kind of um do n't really interest me and um I do n't know what to do with those so I better get some information from magazines .
