My home is a place which I like the most .
Um wherever am I I am uh I never get that very comfortable feeling as I am when at home .
The uh first very thing I miss when I 'm not at home is the love of my parents and my brother .
Uh it 's what everybody needs , it 's something that keeps you going and it 's a driving force that uh that keeps you uh doing all that you want .
And the next thing that I miss a lot is the f - food that my mother cooks .
Um um uh even the best pizza in the world can not give the uh the taste that my mom 's food gives .
But then though if I 'm not at home and uh I keep uh thinking of the nostalgic memories that I have and then get going and make good friends with others and uh and uh I keep myself very comfortable wherever am I I am .
