I prefer reading poetry the most because poetry is written by someone else and I can think what the person who wrote this thought about when she or he was writing about it .
And I wa - I like to imagine the this the image what I had while reading the poetry and like to talk to someone else what they thought the poetry they wrote , they read and what I the - I thought while I read it .
So , I prefer reading poetry the most .
