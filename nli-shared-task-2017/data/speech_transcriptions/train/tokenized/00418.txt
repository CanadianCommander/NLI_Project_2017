A special opportunity was given to me was to teach Hindi , which is uh the national language of India , in a social uh organization .
And this opportunity was very important to me because uh I 'm preparing uh for a teaching career and this experience will help me a lot as I prepare for this career .
Uh this uh opportunity also uh helps me to connect with my roots uh I 'm also uh able to impart uh this training to uh children who are away from their uh home country uh so if they uh know the language they will feel connected to their roots .
So I think uh I am uh .
