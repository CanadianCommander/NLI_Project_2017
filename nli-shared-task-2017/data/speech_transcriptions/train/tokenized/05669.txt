For me the most , the greatest opportunity that I 've ever had was um coming here US to study .
Because I met a lot of people here and uh and learn a. a lot of cultures different culture that I , I 'd never known .
So that was good opportunity to know how the world is and that and I , I learn that there 's a lot of people in the world , different kind of people so .
