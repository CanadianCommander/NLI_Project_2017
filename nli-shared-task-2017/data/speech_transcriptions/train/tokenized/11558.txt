When I 'm away from my home I usually miss the kind of security the home provides uh you know , the more security feel , the secure feeling you get when you are with your parents .
Um I also miss food that is uh my home cooked food which is pretty delicious and I do n't get the taste of my mother 's uh food anywhere else .
Apart from this also being amongst loved ones is pretty relaxing I mean after work , it 's pretty relaxing to come back and talk have a chat with your parents and uh to chat about things that are important .
I also miss uh chat with my dad uh that uh I occasionally have whenever I 'm in fix .
He helps me out with all the problems , is what I miss .
