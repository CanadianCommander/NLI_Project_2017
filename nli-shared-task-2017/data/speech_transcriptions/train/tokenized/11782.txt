Okay if I had friends coming from other country uh that we 're going to visit um Canada ans spend sometime in Montreal our city , I would suggest them to um to come to Quebec and Montreal for a little visit .
Uh the University of Quebec and Montreal is uh situated uh near the Saint-Catherine Est .
Um there is a lot of things to visit there , there 's a little museum uh and also there 's an empty theater that is very big and cozy uh and a lot of firm , of lectures are giving their uh for their the general public and there are concerns about so on uh literature .
So it 's a mainly uh big cultural place .
