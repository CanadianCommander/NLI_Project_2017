I 'll suggest to visit in Tokyo because of the building and scene .
The Taisha Temple or in Kyoto and it shows the history and culture of ancient Japan .
It is good to know the history and culture of the culture and also the scene is very beautiful .
You can see the different views of four seasons so it is good to go one of the seasons .
