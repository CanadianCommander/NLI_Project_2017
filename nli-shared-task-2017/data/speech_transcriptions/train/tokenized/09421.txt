An accomplishment uh that took a lot of hard work for me , was organizing the competition in my university .
It was important because it is the first of its kind uh being organized at the university and it took a lot of hard effort and uh organizing abilities and a lot of uh things that I had uh never done before .
Why it was important to me was because at the end of the whole exercise I uh managed to prove a lot to myself about my confidence , my abilities , my general skills and talent and interacting with people and handling people .
