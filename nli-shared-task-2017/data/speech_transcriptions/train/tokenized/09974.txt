Well uh I live in Italy which is one of the most beautiful countries in the world .
So it 's quite easy to think or some places for tourists .
And uh I would suggest uh Venice thinking of the experience of other people who go there very uh and they enjoy very much .
There are lots of American tourists for instance in Venice .
And I would suggest Florence too according to my experience because um I think it 's uh the most beautiful city in Italy .
It 's rich of histories and uh hist - and monuments .
And this are definitely the two towns that I would suggest to foreigners to come to Italy .
