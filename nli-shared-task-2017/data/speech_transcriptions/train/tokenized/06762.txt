One of the hardest accomplishment which was given to me was prepa - preparation of my school choir in my high school days .
There are two reasons , first of all I was the one the chief members who should gather the classmate all together to make a perfect harmony .
It was a really hard work to adjustment make and prepare adjustment to appeal all the other students and that .
There other time however , I can get advantages through it such as getting , get along together with cool classmate well and we finally became a great friend through all the semester .
