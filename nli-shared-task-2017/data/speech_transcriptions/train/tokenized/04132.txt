A quality uh that you have to have when you work in a team is that you 're able to see , to see where help is needed , uh what kind of help is needed , where you can help uh , which person needs your and uh and that you see uh what you have to work on uh next , and who needs to work with you .
So you can , you 're able to work together then and if everyone has an eye for the other one 's work and is able to see what is needed , then you can work together , otherwise if someone does n't see it , then it 's a problem uh because you work for you and not for the team .
