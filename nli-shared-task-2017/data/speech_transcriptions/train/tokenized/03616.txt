Well I will suggest my fiends visit the city called Dehradun .
It 's capital of Uttarakhand State in um in India .
The city is famous for it 's valleys , snow fall , it 's beautiful nature forest and people who are very helping nature and Dehradun is very famous for its holy places like temples which are very famous and which have lot of history behind them and I would definitely suggest my friend to go and visit those kind of places to have a good uh reasonable break from his daily routine and I 'm sure he 'll definitely have a very cool nature there .
