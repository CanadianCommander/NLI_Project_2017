I was very much inspired by my father who worked very hard in his younger age and he worked very little uh uh and he worked very hard to work and went to the states and now he is doing as a contractor which uh which is a very good stage in his life , even in society and I 'm actually inspired by his various teaching and the very behavior with me .
And and actually uh uh he wanted to become a mechanical engineer and and due to some financial problems he was not able to do it and now I 'm doing it .
And I and I feel very happy to do this .
