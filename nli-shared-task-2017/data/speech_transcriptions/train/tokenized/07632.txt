If I were to take friends from another country I would take them to city of Kyoto .
City of Kyoto has many traditional temples that is the best display of traditional Japanese architecture as well as culture .
Also I would take them to a shrine in Kamakura area where they will see a different architecture uh from the sixteen hundred uh uh .
