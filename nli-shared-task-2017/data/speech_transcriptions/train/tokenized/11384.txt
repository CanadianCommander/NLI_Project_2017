A big opportunity that was given me was to study engineering .
This is uh for some reason , the first one is that I really like this subject .
The second reason is that I think it could be useful for my professional life in the future .
In fact , if you study a subject such as engineering you will probably um you will probably have a job that you like and that will be important for you and for other person .
So I think that this was my biggest opportunity and that 's all .
