Well the book I 'm going to talk about is a book I read in my literature and technology class in my school .
It 's Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep and is by Philip K. Dick .
I think it 's very interesting uh basically because I 'm really interested in science fiction and it 's a science fiction book .
But the other reasons are that it conveys , it 's talks about , talks about different ideas which are related to our world now .
And it implements them to the future world so well that seems like it talks about what today 's world and the future world in that single book .
