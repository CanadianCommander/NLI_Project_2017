Well when I 'm away from home , I miss uh the home cooking from my home .
Um I miss the home cooking because you ca n't get the kind of cooking that my mom makes anywhere else like at school .
Because at school most of the time you get cafeteria food , but at my house I get my mom 's cooking and my mom 's cooking that individual unique taste that um really makes me feel comfortable .
And I feel that my mother 's food is really what makes uh me the most happy and uh gives me the most delight in every meal .
And I also miss traditions on my house like making rice cakes and cooking with my family and just hanging out with my family .
