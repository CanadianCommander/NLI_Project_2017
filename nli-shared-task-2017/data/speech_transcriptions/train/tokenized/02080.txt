The biggest thing I miss when I 'm away from my home is uh being with my family .
Uh since I live Arab country uh we have we we used to have uh big families .
We all live in the same house , from the grandmother all the way to the smallest kid .
Uh so you get a sense of uh a very close uh relationship with everybody in the house , from your grandfather , grandmother and so on .
And the other thing uh I miss is uh uh you get your mother to cook for you and to get some nice food from uh where she cooks .
And also you .
