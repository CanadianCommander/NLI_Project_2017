A special opportunity that was given to you is the election of student clerk .
Um I 'm a International student , so at the beginning I did n't really fully involved into the school affairs but uh the election of the student clerk gave me the chance .
At the beginning I did n't really know who actually nominated me but uh after as soon as I noticed that I just knew uh I just said , yeah I 'm going to do .
This this opportunity really gave me the chance to get involved into the school affairs , to let people know me and uh let me to know more people and uh finally I succeeded and uh it 's really a good challenge for me .
