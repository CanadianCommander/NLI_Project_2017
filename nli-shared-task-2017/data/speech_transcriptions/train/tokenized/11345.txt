WhenI'm away from home what I miss the most will be my family .
Um at some point it is very hard to deal with the situations on my own .
Um especially around um family celebration-celebration times like Christmas or Easter while I know my family is gathered in France but I 'm not there .
Uh another thing I miss of course is my friends , um my very important to me and thanks to the Internet it is very nice to be able to see them and talk to them .
What I miss also is the food , I love French food and uh it is sometimes very hard to uh cook for my own on , my own for my self .
Yeah I miss France , in general .
