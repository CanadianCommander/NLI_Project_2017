The people whom I miss the most are my parents when I leave my home I miss something altogether .
The more things winch I miss about is about is the food which I generally eat at home , and also I miss the atmosphere which I live in .
Also when I was in Pune , I learned a lot over there regarding staying alone and the response what I got by staying alone .
But the main aspect which comes about is you miss your home .
The home is a place where you 've been born and brought about and it gives you a sense of inspiration as to what you want to do in your further .
I miss a lot about my home when I leave my country when I leave my place .
And that 's the things which I really miss are my family , friends and the people whom I really care about and that 's what makes me miss them .
