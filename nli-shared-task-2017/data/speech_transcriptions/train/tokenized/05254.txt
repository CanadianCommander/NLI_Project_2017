I would like to talk about the The Barney Version by Mordechai Richler .
He 's a Hebrew comedian writer and um I like this book because it is a different way to look at an autobiography .
Um because the life of the main character which is uh readily autobiographical in the sense that it 's very close to the author .
His uh told in a very original way it do n't follow um um the succession of the events and time but it is organized my semantics and every event in in Barney 's life is depicted with humor and originality .
