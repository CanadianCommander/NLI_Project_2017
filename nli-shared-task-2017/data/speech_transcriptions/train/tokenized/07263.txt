As compared to novel or poetry because uh magazine is a very accessible thing which you can right at doorsteps by your newspaper vendor or someone , or you can get a magazine pretty easy available in a library or something .
So you know it 's quite easy to get a magazine available .
Then I feel that a magazine covers a more vital range of topics and issues and the they discuss a lot of conc - current issues which we need to know about and they touch on on on on lot of aspects of society , of politics of sports .
And so and so on .
