I like reading mystery books and uh science uh mystery books and scientific books because uh they are interesting to read and uh they give me uh , I do n't know , information about stuff and and there 's a lot of hard grammar that I can learn about from those books .
And and I basically read uh any type of book that I can find but uh I only read about ten books each year so I do n't read that much in total .
