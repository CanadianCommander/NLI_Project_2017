Hi , I 'd like to talk about um the Harry Potter books , the four books of the series .
I had to read them before my son did just to find uh whether it was appropriate for my son who 's about uh twelve years of age .
I was quite amazed by the uh by the full theme of the books and it was very uh interesting and very exciting for him to read uh right uh the four four books .
I 'm sorry that I could not uh read the last b - the final one .
I found the book interesting and .
