I miss the most my family when I 'm away .
First , I live in my parents ' house with my sister so I f - see them everyday s - therefore I feel lonely if I ca n't see them .
Second , they provide many things so if I have a difficulties they listen my problem and willing to help me .
Therefore if I am away I really miss my parents and sister the most .
