Uh what I miss most uh about my home when I 'm away is uh the comfort I have at home like my my bed or my bathroom or everything that I know that I enjoy .
I also um miss um my parents uh and the thing I can I can live with , the people I 'm living uh with .
And there is just those little habits that we have like when you get up , you open the window and see uh landscaping .
This is little things that you miss when you 're not at home .
Um yes so I would say that it 's comfort , habits and and um things I share with my parents .
