When I away , when I 'm away from home I 'll miss two things .
The first thing is uh family , although I can call to uh them by uh phone but it 's total diff - different from talk with face to face .
And the another thing I 'll miss uh in the another country were away with home is uh food which is made by my mother .
Uh especially kimchi the traditional food in Korea uh my mother can make it very perfectly , very delicious .
So I 'm very with them .
