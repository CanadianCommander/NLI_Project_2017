Which I have read so far is uh the book about a college uh in in which I was uh interested to get admitted but after reading the book carefully and interestingly I found various negative aspects uh related with that uh uh particular institute or college .
And uh as I could n't meet , uh I could n't meet to uh that college because of my uh because of my low score in a particular test it gave me uh s - , uh some satisfaction to some extent that uh uh that I was a benefactor for not getting admitted to that college because it had certain drawbacks which I had overlooked uh for uh while preparing for that college .
The book was very interesting as it .
