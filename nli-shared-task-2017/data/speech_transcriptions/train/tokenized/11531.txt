When I go uh when I go out of my house I miss very very much my my parents .
I I like spending my time with them .
I like uh spending and watching TV with them , talk to with them and that 's why it means them so much .
Uh I also miss my friends which I I adore .
I like going out with them and going to the cinema .
We have very very good times but when I 'm not with them I think I miss them and I need them so when I go abroad uh the most things I 'll I miss are my my parents and my friends .
