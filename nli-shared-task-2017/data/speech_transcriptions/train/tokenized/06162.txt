Out of all the reading material available to us today , I like magazines .
In specific , I like the National Geography Journal which I have subscribe to .
I my grandfather used to read this magazine to me when I was a little girl .
I like it so much because it explores all the nooks and corners of the world and collects all the information in one book .
Most of the details given are in depth and they connect on parts of the world .
It 's like visiting that place even though I 'm in my house .
