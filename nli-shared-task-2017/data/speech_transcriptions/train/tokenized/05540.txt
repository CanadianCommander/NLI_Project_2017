Last year um at my school in Korea I was given given the opportunity that I could go to uh the university in US as an exchange student and I took that opportunity .
And the opportunity was important because um I could n't get the chance uh to know wh - what the classes at an American university are like and how the life in US is like and give me the chance to live in US .
