Well in my opinion , uh the most the thing you miss miss most when you 're away is uh I think the friends and uh your family .
That depends normally on how long you 're staying away .
But when you 're away for a long time it is usually quite difficult to stay away from uh people you love .
It 's also for me some very difficult when you are away especially here from Spain .
It is the food uh it 's difficult to adjust to , to the culture and to the gastronomy of other countries or other places .
When you are away uh of course it depends on the culture or the country you 're traveling to but it 's quite .
