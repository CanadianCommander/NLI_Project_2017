Work very hard .
An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh preparing and conducting a technical fest in my college .
I think it was uh very important to me because it required me to put in a lot of skills .
Like I need coordination so that I can match up with all the other departments in my college and perform it well and I needed to interact with lots of people to get things done .
I needed to talk to lecturers , I needed to talk to the guests who were coming , I needed to talk to people who would get the things I needed done .
So all those required me to put in a lot of skills from my side .
And there was also also a lot of hard work that was needed .
And finally , the success of the event will measure how capable I am and it 'll it is one of my chances to prove myself as really good person and someone who can manage things .
