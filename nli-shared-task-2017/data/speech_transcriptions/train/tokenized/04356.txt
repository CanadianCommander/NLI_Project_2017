First I would suggest them to visit the most important cities of Italy , that is my country .
I will begin with Florence which is my city and then Venice and Rome which is the mo - most important cities in Italy .
Uh Florence is perhaps the most important city as a renascence city , while Venice is , is the city for lovers , as all know .
Um Rome it is famous for it 's ancient ruins , the and many other things .
Of course that is not all , all you can see in Italy , you can see many , much more for example uh visiting the sea side places which are beautiful especially in Sardinia one of the most important islands of Italy .
