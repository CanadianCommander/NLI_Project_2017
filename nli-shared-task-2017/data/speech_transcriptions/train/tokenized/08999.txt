Um as I am abroad and as I am abroad studying um I can hardly see my parents .
So what I most miss about miss , what I missed about my home like when I 'm away is like my mom and dad , because they are so important like person like people to me .
And also food that is so different , the style is different and also the taste is different and how they cook is different like Korean food they are normally um spicy and not very oily but food in England .
