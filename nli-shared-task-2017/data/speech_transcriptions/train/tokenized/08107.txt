The interesting book I read uh before was about the World War Two , how it started .
It was interesting because there was uh two visions to see how it started from Japanese and USA .
So there there was a some officers both in Japan and USA and also there was feeling of the citizens leaving Japan , USA and the feeling of the citizen uh is very changing and is got very different ways both of it .
And Japan is more weak to weak to con - confess to the politics .
