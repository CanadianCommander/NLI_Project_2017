If I were to choose between having a job or having a career , I would rather choose the former .
My reasons are as the as follows .
Firstly , having a job can make me have enough time to uh uh can make me have enough time to stay with my family because a job has a scheduled time and um uh if I follow the time I have enough spare time .
Um secondly , having a job uh can have a stable income .
No matter no matter what uh what I have uh what I have done , I can I can also receive the the same income in uh every month .
