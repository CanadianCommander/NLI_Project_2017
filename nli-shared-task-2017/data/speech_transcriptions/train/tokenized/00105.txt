When I 'm away from home for a long time , the things I miss most are my family , my father , my brothers , I have two brothers and I have a really good relationship with them .
And I miss also my dog which is a golden retriever and I really like how he 's , it is um happy when sees he sees me .
And also I miss a lot of uh love my the food I eat in my family , my my father is great cook and uh in Italy it is um really common to have really good things to eat and so whenever I 'm brought , um I 'm supposed to eat local thing .
