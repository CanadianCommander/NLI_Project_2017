Very interesting book I 've read is High Fidelity by Nick Hornby .
It is uh uh , I liked it because it is very funny and uh uh uh successfully talk about human way of approaching uh way to relationship between uh men and women .
It is uh very funny because uh there is a man that uh try to find out why uh his uh ex-girlfriend uh leaved uh and broke uh out relationship .
And it is very funny because uh Hornby uh design and dr - draw an interesting uh way of human being and uh that 's what I think about it .
