We have pretty much the best uh place in Mexico .
Uh we have a lot of cultural sites to visit particularly the ruins of uh Aztec temples uh at the downtown .
And uh near the suburbs where you have some of the largest ruins uh , uh in , in the whole country , uh which also has uh a site museum where they can see the figures found in the ruins and buy souvenirs .
