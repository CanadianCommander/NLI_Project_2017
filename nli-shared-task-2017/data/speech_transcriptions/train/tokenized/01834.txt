Special opportunity that was given me is my father , and my father says I , do you want to go to USA , USA School ?
And I say y - I do n't know .
And my father said like you are go to see me to go to USA stay and work .
So do you want to go to school ?
And the next day I said like I do n't know but maybe .
And one month later I say yes , and that was my the special opportunity because I can go to USA and I am in USA now .
