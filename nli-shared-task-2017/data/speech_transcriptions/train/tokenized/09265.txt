My hardest challenging has been by now going to Japan and learning some Japanese and that 's what why I 'm here .
I started about four years ago in my town .
I found an old karate master that teaches his dojo some Japanese classes .
When I was young , I loved some cartoons of the Japanese animation and I am fas - very fascinated about their culture .
