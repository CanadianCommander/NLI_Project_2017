A special opportunity I was given was to study abroad at the university of California in Brooklyn .
The home university in Germany is a special cooperation with University of California and so I was able to get a special fellowship .
And and it was quite easy for me to to get a spot and I really like studying in the US and also it was really important because it shaped my decision on the future life .
I 'm I 'm taking this to as in order to get a seat in a graduate program in political science in the United States and also I really enjoy life there and I 'm thinking about immigration right now so it was really an important opportunity .
