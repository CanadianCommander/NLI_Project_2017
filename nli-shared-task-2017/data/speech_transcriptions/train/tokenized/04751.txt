Whenever you are in this world you will always miss your home .
The personal touch , the love your of your parents , your siblings will always be missing .
Whenever you are you whenever you go to your mother and see any problem it is solved at that moment .
I do I do n't know how but whenever I speak to my mother the first time and I 'm in on her laps , it 's just I feel that I 've solved all my problems .
Then uh secondly , I miss my mom 's food a lot .
She is an expert cook and whenever I eat , whatever I eat the best food is my mom 's hands .
No one can make as good food as her and and no one can be I can never more happy than uh with my family .
