At the end of my university I was given the opportunity to go to Africa to start working on a research project .
Uh this was very important for me since it gave me the opportunity to apply knowledge learnt at school in the field and I 'd studied economics so I was working a research on development uh project in Kenya .
And so through this project I thought I uh used my skills in a useful way .
And this is something that I was very uh keen about .
Uh definitely the experience was of great and moments .
But overall I will say that it has had , it has had an invaluable um value for my personal and intellectual growth .
