If I had the choice and if I had the ability to do it , I would uh love to be a doctor to help people .
And especially work in an NGO in areas where you do n't have any doctors to prevent um disease and or help people basically .
Um if I um if I have to choose the country in which I would like to work I would uh pick Africa because it 's a country where I have been and lived .
And I en - I enjoyed the culture over there .
Um in terms of N - NGOs I would pick probably the UNESCO .
