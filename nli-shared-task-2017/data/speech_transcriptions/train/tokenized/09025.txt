The last four years of my life have been spent living in town called Baroda and if friends from another country were going to spend time in our country then definitely that would be the place I would suggest them to visit .
Baroda though it has a small population and is a small town still has all the amenities of a big city starting from cinema halls , to multiplexes , to malls .
And at the same time it has all the conveniences of a small town as well with wide open areas , gardens and wide roads .
Baroda is a big tourist attraction for the kids that are there located of shore to the coast and Baroda also has people , people who are very affectionate and friends coming from other countries will surely enjoy the stay in Baroda .
