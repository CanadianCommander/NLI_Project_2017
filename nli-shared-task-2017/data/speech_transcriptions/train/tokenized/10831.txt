The most important accomplishment that required me to work really hard was my internship last summer , with the Orion Foundation where I had to design an entire campaign for the international children 's festival of performing arts .
It required thorough research on the previous festivals I had to , I had to go on uh go through all their previous documentations in the camping , the adverts , posters .
Besides all that I had to , it required a lot of time , devotion of time , quality time and a lot of energy because it was after all an event or chil - young children .
So I had to interact a lot - took a lot of interaction with really young children , young students from all across the uh world .
