Well when abroad or away from my home town what I miss the most is my family when they 're close to me they support me and they give me power to keep going on achieving the things I want .
Uh they are nice to me and if staying far from them uh to learn things by myself , I really like the time I spend with them when I 'm in my home town .
Uh I also miss my car , my friends and uh you know my car when abroad the US trains and buses and it 's kind of uncomfortable .
