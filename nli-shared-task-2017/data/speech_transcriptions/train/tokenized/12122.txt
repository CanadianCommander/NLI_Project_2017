Um I actually myself so I do n't have any family to live with but of course where I am from I have my family who I have somebody to talk to .
And also I I was raised in three with three sisters .
So there was all these noises and on my um inside my house .
So there is um some part by myself but um usually I always turn the TV on so that I can hear the noise or play CD with new music to spend the time by myself .
