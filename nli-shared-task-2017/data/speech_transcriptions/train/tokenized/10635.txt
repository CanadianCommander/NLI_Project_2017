Well I 'm very attached to my family and the people that live at my house um so leaving them is a terrible experience for me .
Um I miss , I miss them but I miss also their supports and their advices they can give me when I 'm in difficult situations .
Um I will also miss my pets because I 'm really attached to my dog and I do a lot of sports with her and I go web burning with her , well with it .
And uh I will also miss um my computer , everything that is on it and everything I can do with it , uh the pictures that I look at very often .
Um and uh yes the general comforts that I find at home because I , it is the best place I can be .
