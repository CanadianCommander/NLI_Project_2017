I think leadership is the most important quality for a team or group member to have .
Uh first of all uh I think leadership is the most important value because uh if you have this quality people can follow your um your statement , uh people can follow what your your needs .
Another reason why I think uh it is very important is my own experience .
In my job I can prove that uh as general manager of the company I can prove that if you have leadership you can obtain yourself easier than if you are not leader .
So for those reasons I think that uh being a leader is very important .
