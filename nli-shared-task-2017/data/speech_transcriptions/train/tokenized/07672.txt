Had uh in my life is when I had IAT exam .
It 's basically entrance to any Indian Institute Technology with uh seven IT 's that we have in India and the most pesti - prestigious ones .
It directly required me to work really really hard uh to qualify this exam .
As we have uh more more than appearing for this exam and only uh two thousand people have been selected and I was I want to be one of the lucky ones so that 's why I uh worked really hard .
And it was important for me because from childhood only I wanted to be a engineer for my IAT because IAT is a big name in India .
Everybody every student has an inspiration from the childhood only that he wants to be a part of IAT .
So that 's why I really work very hard to have that accomplishment and I accomplish that and now I 'm in IAT .
