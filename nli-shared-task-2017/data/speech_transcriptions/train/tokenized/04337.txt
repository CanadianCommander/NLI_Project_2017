I am a medical doctor and I must say that my study took me a lot of work .
I had to study during six years , very hard and it was not so easy .
But it was worth to study like that because now uh I am my favorite job .
I can help people , I can uh be there to listen to their problems and I am also uh learning everyday uh new things , very in - interestings matter and uh it is the most beautiful work in the world so I am very happy to have accomplished it .
