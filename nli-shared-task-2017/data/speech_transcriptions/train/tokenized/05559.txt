It 's very important that all the members are not too aggressive because if you have a group and in this group is a member who is very aggressive , then other group members who might be um some kind of introverted and maybe even shy um will be reluctant to express their own opinion and if this guy is very aggressive and he uh does n't want to adapt or he he even does n't want to listen to the opinion of other um members , the the outcome of the work or yeah of the work of the team um will not be very valuable .
