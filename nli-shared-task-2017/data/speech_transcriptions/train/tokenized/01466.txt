We have a couple of um castles which could be shown to guest .
Uh we also have a lot of museums which is quite interesting also popular all over the world .
Of course if they will arrive in Autumn , I would maybe bring them to Munich to the October fest .
I think it is quite interesting uh event to see for the visitors of Germany .
Additionally , of course the capital , Berlin has to be seen if someone arrives in Germany .
I think uh because there of course after the reunited , reunation of Germany uh a lot of the centers complete union of .
