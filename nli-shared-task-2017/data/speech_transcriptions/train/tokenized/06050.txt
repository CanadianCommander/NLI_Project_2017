I miss uh the happiness , love from home I can sh - share my sadness when I 'm sad and I hap - can share my happiness with my parents .
So I think being with uh my parents , the most important thing for me is that I can be there to uh uh express my sorrow , grief uh sadness , anger and someone to share my s - s - uh feelings so that they can help me out whenever I need and uh this is the best way I can relate to my parents and I can close to them and so uh I a - I always want to be close to my uh parents even , even when I am far away .
These are the most important things that I misses .
