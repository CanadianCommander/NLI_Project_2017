And the career I want to be is a teacher because that 's my major .
I uh studied uh for four years in my college so I think uh since it 's my major I can major in the world .
And another reason is I really enjoyed it and because I feel just I feel uh happy , uh I feel greater for self confidence when I see my students make progress in English , uh they clap and they make some changes uh improvement in the classroom .
That kind of things can make me feel confidence and happy .
Another reason is it 's good for you to keep uh contact with young peoples , keep you young and innovation .
