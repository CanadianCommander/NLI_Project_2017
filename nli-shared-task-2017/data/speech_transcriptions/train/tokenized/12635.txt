I would suggest for a place to visit in Italy um sea seaside called Maratea which is situated in a region called Basilicata .
I 'm mentioning this because I was born um in this region and I was always going there with my my family on holidays .
And it 's a very very very um particular place and with awesome scenery and very nice uh blue clear waters , which are perfect to to swim or dive .
And there 's many tourist going there every year .
Um they enjoy the weather , they enjoy the food , uh the enjoy all the surrounding areas , you can go around touring and then all these sweet places .
So I would highly recommend it .
