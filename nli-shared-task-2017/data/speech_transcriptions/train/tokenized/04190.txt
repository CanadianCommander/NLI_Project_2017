In my point of view , I prefer novels to read in my free time because novels are easy to read and you have to lay back , you do n't really have to think about a problem .
Um this might be the reason because I have to us - read scientific materials for my studies and um therefore I do n't really like to read magazines .
So novels will tell a story and you can totally relax and think about something different than my own studies .
This is why I would prefer to read novels .
