When I travel usually I feel homesick like after two or three weeks .
And what I miss the most is my house , my room , my friends when they come over and we enjoy our time , uh my short wa - walk uh every evening uh to the beach , sitting in our house terrace at midnight listening to music , while I watch the sky and the stars .
ALso what I , what I miss is our native in local pro - programs that show in our local TV .
Um I miss a lots of things actually , and it 's , it 's irreplac - re - irreplaceable , my house is irreplaceable .
