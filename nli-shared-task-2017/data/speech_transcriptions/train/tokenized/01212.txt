Four major qualities which I think make someone a valuable member of a team , first of all the understanding .
They should be a very the every member of the team should have a proper understanding with each other .
A team basically does not involve a one-man show .
It is a who team effort .
Therefore , unless there is proper understand , there will be confusions .
They would not be able to achieve their goal properly because of those confusions .
Therefore understanding is a must .
Second one is mingling .
You should be able to interact with all of them .
You should have proper terms and conditions , good relationships because then only you 'll be able to fight for a goal together .
Third , what I feel most important is team spirit .
The whole team is responsible for their action , not just one person .
So , the team should take into and every person should have the team spirit and should not hold other person responsible .
