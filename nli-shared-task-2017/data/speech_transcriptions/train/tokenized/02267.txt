So an accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the TOEFL test , the preparation of the TOEFL test .
Because of uh it was uh quite about uh quite about one year that I sp - did n't speak English and so it was very difficult for me uh we began to study English .
And also because of uh this uh exam is very difficult but uh I 'm doing engineering and I have to do this test because of uh it is a requirement for the graduation .
But it is uh very difficult because of it has many separated parts very difficult .
