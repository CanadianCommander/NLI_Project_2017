I prefer to do , to read magazines because magazine have a lot of picture you can read it sometimes if you do n't understand the thing or two they talk .
You can watch the magazine , you can watch , you an see the picture and you understand more what is the definition and the meaning .
I do n't really like to read poetry because I 'm not like a study student .
And poetry has a lot of words you have to read more to understand it , you have to find your definition is about it and never .
