Um I guess if I could have any job I wanted , I would actually um like to uh be in charge maybe the product , project manager for uh an international N , NGO or maybe um the International Red Cross or something like that .
Uh because first of all I think it would be a very motivating job in the sense that you are working for a good course .
Um you are helping people around the world , you know depending on the NGO obviously , um but also I like being in charge uh I find it very motivating , I like um motivating people actually being impa - uh being part of a team .
And in that sense I think it would be an ideal job for me obviously tho - um those jobs , jobs are hard to get um but yeah that would my ideal job .
