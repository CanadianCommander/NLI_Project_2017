My requirement was uh to play this specific basketball team which uh played in the highest league which is around India and uh I tried really hard to get in there because I practice every day around two hours , uh hours and I uh took a lot of shots and a lot of work out to , to be fit so that I can accomplish with the team .
And on the whole um I , I was invited um to , to um practice with the team and after the practice they told me that I 'm allowed to join the team because uh the practice that I had taken before was enough , so that the team was content with me and I was able to join the team .
