I think that uh a quality that somebody from my team should have is the spirit of cohesion uh because it prevents the team from acting separate - separately and uh makes the team to work as just uh one one member uh what gives more strength and uh power to this team .
So the spirit of cohesion is essential if uh uh we want to work as a team in order to keep everybody together .
