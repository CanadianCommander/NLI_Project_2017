I think the quality makes someone a valuable member of a team is the willingness to sacrifice .
Is since he 's a member of a team the first point he or she should consider is the common goal of the team .
If everyone in the team is egoistic it will ruin the goal of the whole team .
So the willingness to sacrifice once own interest is very important .
A quality of some one who is valuable member of a team .
