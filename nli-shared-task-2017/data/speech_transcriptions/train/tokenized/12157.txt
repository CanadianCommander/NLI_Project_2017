Well if some friends of mine came to to Florence , I 'd definitely take them to the stadium uh uh especially when uh like uh when there are matches and the stadium is a it 's a really amazing place because uh about forty forty thousand people were there and they they sing , they clap their hands uh they use cards to to do things and it 's really it 's really amazing .
Then I 'd take them to uh to restaurant after I 'll take them to restaurant in the stadium uh so we , you know to get the the good things that my France cuisine can can give .
