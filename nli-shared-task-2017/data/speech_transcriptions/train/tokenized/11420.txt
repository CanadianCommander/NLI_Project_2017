Uh I most , what I most miss is I think sometimes I miss Sunday mornings when I was in Korea cause uh usually on Sunday mornings my father , whole family are in my house and my father is watching TV in the living room and my brother is on the sofa and playing with his toys and my mother in the kitchen and sometimes I really miss that , that situations and here I do n't have any family so on Sundays maybe I could , I could turn up with my friends but .
