What I missed the most when I was away my internship this summer to USA was my family and apart from them the food my mom that the food that my mom cooked for me .
I really missed the home cooked food and I hated cooking the food for my own self on my own .
And then when you are home you have an easy ac - access to things and you can stay comfortably in an environment you adjusted to all this life .
But when I was away I did n't miss my comfortable stay and the accessible things I had to go out and shop for them on my own .
It is all on my own , when I 'm home I have my parents to support me for everything even if I have to go out somewhere I have my parents to take me there , whereas when I 'm away I so not have this option as well .
