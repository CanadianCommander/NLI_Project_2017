I got a special opportunity to help people uh recently uh I went to a with my my classmates and my friends in my university .
We went to German town in Philadelphia and then we help we went there for a week , we helped a lot of people .
For example , you go to the Mercy House we help the elderly people who may who may have some mental problems and uh we talk to them .
We we try to play games with them and uh spend time with them , just talk to them .
That 's a good feeling .
So and then we also go to the uh school to help children to study .
That is a good .
