A quality that I think makes someone a valuable member of a group or team is honesty .
Since it people to work in a group or with interact with other people and if you have honesty then people start to trust have trust in you starts to believe in you which can create loyalty or a bond within a team .
And if that happens and one can become a leader and that will make a better team and as a group I think it will be a good environment .
