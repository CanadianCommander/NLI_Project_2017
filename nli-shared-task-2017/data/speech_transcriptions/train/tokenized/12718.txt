I think whats most important for people to uh were in a team is um you know what you referred as a team player .
So people who know how uh to be cooperative , people who know um how to act and towards other people and how to behave in a group .
Um I think it 's really important to yeah sort of manage with other people and uh get along with them and try to make him for effort e - effort as a whole and not as a single person because that 's what uh makes a team strong or weak .
If everybody acts on his own then nobody will actually um achieve what they want .
