Because Italy my country is so famous for very many things foods , history and lifestyle I would suggest to my friend to go first to a restaurant a restaurant in Florence which are very well .
And where they prepare pasta and different other dishes very typical to the place .
Then second food eatery , I would suggest to my friend to go and to go to Rome and visit the Castel which is of course so known that it does n't require any explanation more .
And third for the lifestyle I would suggest my friend to go and to come with me to my town where there are a lot of parties .
