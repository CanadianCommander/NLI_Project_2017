I got opportunity to go study to the United States for one year .
And that was important to me because I learned how to speak more fluency and more correctly .
And in the way that the United States has it 's culture .
I learn how to speak faster um and like the country .
And the opportunity that was given to me was very special for me because is the only one time I went to the United States to study , and that 's very memorable for me but uh a little bad sometime .
