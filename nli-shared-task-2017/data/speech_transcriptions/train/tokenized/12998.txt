The hardest accomplishment that I have ever taken was probably the sports test for my studies in uh I studied sport economics and therefore I had to do a sport test to show that I 'm able to do uh , my studies .
And uh I had to um , train for that very hard .
It was uh several ball games like basketball , volleyball and handball but also uh gymnastics and uh athletics .
And it took me about four months to prepare for this test and I uh graduate , uh graduated at this uh successful .
And uh so it was uh , yeah very good .
