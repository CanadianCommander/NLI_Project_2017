To answer this question I will let use my first hand uh experience because I had uh friends uh coming over my country It - Italy to visit me .
And I went with them to visit uh some the cities that I think are the most interesting and important uh to visit in Italy .
So I just would like to start with the first ; the most important that is Rome .
That uh , I think and I believe that is one of the most beautiful and also an interesting to visit for historical background .
And uh it offers a lot of monuments and touristic attractions in general .
And uh it 's very pleasant uh city to be in at this season .
And , and probably Rome is , is the one that they really want to visit .
