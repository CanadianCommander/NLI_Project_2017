Learning a new language which is English was a big uh inco - uh accomplishment for me .
Uh I had to work very hard for it and during school time and I had to travel to overseas countries to do that , uh to get uh to learn English properly .
And uh I consider it very important because it gave me the opportunity to learn another , a second language and is very helpful in this modern time of ours .
