An opportunity was given to me well , I think my grandfather gave it .
Uh we did n't have the money to afford a university outside from Ecuador , but just like about one month ago he told me to go to his office , and there he explained to me about how he wants me to be a good man , an honorable man when I grow up .
So he said that he would pay all of my college .
That was something that was greatly affective to me because I really did n't expect to anyone pay my college .
I mean , I was going for a college over here in Ecuador like the Catholica or someone someone else .
But then he , he made it happen , and he made it possible , and I want to make the most of it .
