When I 'm away from home uh the most are my parents .
They are the people who taught me everything in my life and they are the people who have molded me into what I am today .
The other thing which I miss more is the surroundings and the people around which I grew up .
I learned the life ways of life , I spend my times , I spend my happiness and even joy and other activities .
The people I spend my good days with but also my pets .
The pet my dog Shiru who was with me since I was nine years old is the person I miss most and I was not able to be present there when he died which pains me a lot .
