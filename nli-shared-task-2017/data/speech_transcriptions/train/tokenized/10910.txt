One of the significant accomplishment that I value very much in life is basically my ability my getting into um by clearing the examination uh called CAT in India .
Uh the examination consisted of uh two parts the interview and exam part .
Coming from a village it was very difficult for me to adopt uh myself and learn English um as require by the CAT .
Also it was very difficult for me to communicate to English and uh uh adjust myself for the interviews .
But uh my determination efforts and passion for getting into basically um helped me a lot and I was able to do well .
