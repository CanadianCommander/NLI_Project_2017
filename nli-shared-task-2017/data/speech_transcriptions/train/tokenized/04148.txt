If friends from another country are going to spend time in my country , I would take them uh to Kerala which is at the southern tip of uh country India .
I would take them to uh Kerala because I think uh Kerala uh is a definitely and ideal city for uh what the world should uh look like or uh what the world looked like when it was originated .
Kerala is a beautiful city .
It has a long coast , beautiful beaches and uh wildlife and also greenery .
It is uh also known as a paradise on earth .
So I would definitely take them uh to Kerala if uh for a visit .
Thank you .
