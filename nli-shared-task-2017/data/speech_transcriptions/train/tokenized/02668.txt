The most important quality in a team member the most quality I look to is a someone who is reliable and someone who you can count on .
Uh be it small teams or uh a large teams your team is a good as the weakest member so someone who can count on whom the members can rely on during uh crucial circumstances is extremely important uh is an extremely important quality for a team member and that is what I 'd look for in a team member .
Another important uh quality is that person should be able to get along with other people in the team so that ability to get along with other people is also important .
