When I 'm away I think that 's um most things that I miss is that uh are , they are my family , and my sisters and all people that compose my family .
And this is because I always spend time with them .
And very good , I have gote very good relation with them with my uncle .
And so this is the , the most thing I miss .
And another thing is my , my place I live , the place where I live with my city attorney .
And this is because I very used to it there and when I go away abroad , for example , one of these , when I were in Spain for as students , as a years I missed a lot these kind of things , yes .
So what about where you stay ?
