I think the most important thing I miss when I 'm away is my friends and my family .
In fact , when you are away you can contact them by phoning or mail or email but it 's not a real contact and in fact when you are travelling when you are away in general it might be difficult and you can feel alone and you have to make new friends I mean it 's the most important .
And also I have to tell about the difference in in in the culture , everything in general that you you can miss from your home country .
I I think uh about the food for example .
