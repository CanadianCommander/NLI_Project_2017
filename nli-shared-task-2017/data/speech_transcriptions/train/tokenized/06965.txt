A very interesting book that I read was the Rabbit Proof Fence .
It was written by an aboriginal Australian lady .
Uh it was really interesting because it talked a lot about aboriginal history and which I find really interesting because they had a ve - , very very hard time during the past and it 's still hard for them now .
And I find it really interesting to read about them , to read about the story and the story was about three girls who escaped from uh weekend uh from uh home where they had been .
There were a lot of suspense so it made it a very interesting story .
At the end it 's easy to escape and they made their way back home but it was really interesting all the way .
