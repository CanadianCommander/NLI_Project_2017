I read many nice books in the recent time but off late I 've been reading many philosophical books of that sort and also and the recent um I read the book called The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari .
It was written by Mr. Robin S. Sharma .
The points which have deeply interested me in the book are those that Mr. Sharma has used his philosophical knowledge combined with today 's convictions of the general society to express how a person can improve upon his life .
How can he accelerate his spiritual being in himself to achieve greater heights and to achieve greater heights in his life .
He have many techniques to hold .
