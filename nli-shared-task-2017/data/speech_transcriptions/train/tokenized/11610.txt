Well um I could plan um at the wedding of a good friend of mine , who was um all ready together with his girlfriend for uh nearly five years .
So they knew they , they knew each other very long , and it was up to me to provide a song which I wrote and make it sure for them as a gift .
Um something really special from yes , we could say heart to heart .
And I played the song in the chapel , while this both uh were married in front of the uh priest .
And the sound of the guitar and all this situation was a bit great deal for me to .
