I tries in Japanese because it is very important for me .
Why I say that , because my mother was working for a Japanese company and in the future one day I will do this job if I want .
So I should can speak Japanese .
So I learn it now in Japan and I try harder and I totally very like these these things .
How how I say that because with uh the China and Japan is totally close but it 's totally different a bit in two languages .
We use Dekanji all of us but it 's totally different .
That 's all .
