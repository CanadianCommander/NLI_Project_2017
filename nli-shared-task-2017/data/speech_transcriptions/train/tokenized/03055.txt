I miss most about my home is my mum .
She is the best person , she , whom I love the most .
Because as I have to live and uh I lived and um also for last one year , I was missing , I missed her so much .
She , she love me so much , she cooked uh good food for me .
And uh I ca n't live without her .
Another thing which I uh miss about my home , is my room .
It is very precious to me .
I have decorated it uh , uh upon my own conditions and also I have uh prepared .
I have completely uh attached with my room .
So these are the two things which I miss .
