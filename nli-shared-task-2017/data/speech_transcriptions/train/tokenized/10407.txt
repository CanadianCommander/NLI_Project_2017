If one of my friends from another country was going to spend time in Turkey I would prefer to choose Istanbul since it 's the most historical and capital city in Turkey .
There are a lot of opportunities to uh for all kinds of people in Istanbul there are lots of places to see .
For example lots of p-pl-places and lots of monuments and after all there are lots of things to see for the morning life .
And as it 's the capital city there are different people with little ethnic background and different cultures who live in harmony so it 's a really good example what kind of a country is Turkey and so that .
