So , he 's he 's a friend told me he wanted to come to my country and visit the city I will actually tell him to go to the city where I used to live in .
It 's called MÃ © rida , is a small town in the mountains , in the state MÃ © rida Venezuela .
And is a little very touristic town .
Uh as I said it 's in the mountains so the climate is is very good is kind of cold the most time of the year .
Uh is near the most high peak in in Venezuela that is called the Bolivar peak and is got the longest cable car uh in in the world .
You ca actually go near the Bolivar peak and we have snow .
We have beach like an hour from there so it 's it 's a very known place to tourism .
