My accomplishment that I needed to work very hard was to accomplish a sales goal that was burden to me uh in the begining of the fiscal year .
And the reason why I need to work very hard was because the goal was set at a high s - high level .
And precisely speaking uh , I had a budget goal of reaching approximately five hundred million Yen , which is equivalent to five million U.S Dollars .
And in order to achieve and accomplish this goal , I had to go to my customers every single day to promote my corporate solutions .
