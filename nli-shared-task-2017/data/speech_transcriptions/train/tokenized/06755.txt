 what I miss most when away from the home is my mom 's food .
It 's actually prepared for example I do n't need to worry about the way it is prepared and all that .
Two , it it my mom prepares a variety of dishes and that way I do n't need to think about how many dishes I need to buy or purchase from outside and I love whatever my mom prepares .
For example she really prepare what I want and according to my taste and uh and the ingredients are put according to the way I want it .
It 's also um the time and preparation is also there like when I want it , for example when it is hot , I want it uh prepared immediately and given and my mom does it for me .
That is why I miss home food .
