I will suggest my friend to spend his time in because it is having very good temples which is build in one twenty four years ago and it is a constructed very well .
And I will send him to the sea shore because that view of the sea shore will be fantastic and the weather that he spent is very good .
And if he will go to the tem - if he will go to the temple , he sees the place and the architecture and the work how they have done anciently , the stone buildings and so on .
So he enjoys the place by seeing that good culture .
