Well um I would , I could not win the auditions for school exam so there was just a moment where mum had to call in and just ask for , for a place for me at the school .
But she did n't come over to ask or first but then I thought that um that they did n't have enough people in their school so they decide to take it .
So I think there was quite a few change for me because I 'm still at that school and I think that was kind of a familiar priority for me .
Because if I had stopped they would not have taken seriously and this for me was priority just made me have this opportunity .
