Well , I read a book by name uh Godfather .
It was written by Mario Puzo and uh I find it very interesting because the way he portray actors of uh them uh , the Godfather uh Marlon Brando , Al Pacino , were all characterized very well .
And uh the uh the story revolves around a family , the Godfather family , that is the Don Corleone family , that is the most basic aspect of uh the entire story that is the protecting the family and uh uh that he is a Don of the whole uh New York State .
They have been immigrated from the Italy .
