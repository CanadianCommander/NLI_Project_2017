One of the most thing which I really miss when I 'm away from home is my family which includes my mum and dad whom I love them a lot .
Because uh their love wi - without their love I ca n't do anything .
And uh the one more , the , then second thing which would I would like to add is the food which I admire , I love a lot .
And the food what I eat at home I , I swear I ca n't get anywhere else .
And also I have the dog at home which I love it and I , I miss a lot when I 'm away .
That 's it , thank you .
