The last interesting book I read was from Ken Follett , Whiteout .
And the reason why I bought bought this book to read it is because I 'm a big fan of the author .
I nearly have every book from him , he 's really great .
His stories are um well the plot of the stories is more as the same , there is um a love story , there 's some um big things going on like in history .
This book was about um a virus which uh which was stolen from a from a lab and could have killed a lot of people .
And in the book the main hero was a woman .
I like this book quite a lot and actually I would suggest everybody to read it .
It 's really nice and interesting book .
