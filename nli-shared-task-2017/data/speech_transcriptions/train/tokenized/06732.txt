I mostly read magazines in my free time uh that 's why I 'm uh mostly a curious person and I 'm curious about politics , I 'm curious about culture and sports and um I find articles on these subjects in the daily or weekly magazines .
For example , if I need to know what 's going on in different parts of the world like America or Asia , I can read an article in a newspaper where there 's uh some background information on a specific subject not like in the news on the radio where there 's only short sample of news and you do n't get any background information .
