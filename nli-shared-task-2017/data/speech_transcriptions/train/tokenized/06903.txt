The most important quality for a team member is to my mind the ability to co - communicate .
Uh a team member should be able to talk to other team members , he should be able to listen when some other team member has something to say .
The ability to commu - to communicate includes uh this two facts , and it 's uh very important for every team work you every person ever has to do .
Um the ability to communicate can not be taught , to my mind it 's a necessity you have or you do not have .
