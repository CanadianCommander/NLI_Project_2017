The most important thing that I miss about my home when I 'm away is my family members , are my family members .
Uh when I am away uh without family support it becomes very difficult to manage your , your uh daily uh uh your daily chores , you know .
For example , cooking for yourself , uh doing , you know , laundry and then working at the same time .
At least when I uh I 'm at home I am convinced and I am assured that my mother or my grandmother , whoever is there to take care of my food and my other thing while I am concentrating either on my work or my studies .
Also uh what I miss are my uh uh you know uh uh uh .
