Friends from another country were going to spend time in my country , I 'd suggest them to visit Lucknow .
Lucknow is capital city of UP which is one of the states of India .
This is a very beautiful city and has a merger or traditional as well as modern cultures .
The best part of it is that it has so many monuments around the city which have intricate details into them .
We can also see glass , glass cloud structures in the city which show the modern architecture of the city .
There are a lot many other things that one should go and watch .
Basically the people around the city are so cooperative that one who comes inside the uh city never feels out of place .
It is a very peaceful and calm uh place that anyone can come and find .
