What I miss most when I 'm away from home is being not with my family because they 've always been a constant support and guidance to me , giving me directions about my career and about the way I should go about taking on life .
I 'm certainly find it difficult to not have at home if I would like know how take a test , they will certainly tell me to go with a peace of mind and also with confidence to take it on .
And this way it has always been important for me to have them by my side and thus having to stay home all through my education careers .
And I decide to go abroad on education in future whenever .
