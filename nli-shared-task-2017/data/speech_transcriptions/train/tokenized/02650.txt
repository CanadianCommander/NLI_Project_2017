Uh well I know the starting from the beginning and because of this I suffered from various uh diseases too .
So I guess the biggest accomplishment for me was to lose weight which I did in a very short span of time and for this obviously I had to go through a lot vigorous excises and maintaining uh cutting on the gym but this was very essential to me because that time had I not lost weight I would have probably suffered from very drastic consequences due the diseases which I was facing .
And uh the part of the preparation was very vigorous and I feel this is the biggest accomplishment for me .
