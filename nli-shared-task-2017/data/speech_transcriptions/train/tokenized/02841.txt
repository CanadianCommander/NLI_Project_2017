I mostly prefer to read uh books or novels based on some thriller and detective type because they always have some new conversations and new topics or something new to learn at because they are related to some detection types .
It can show some skillful talents , how they detect and what they do while detecting such uh crime in books .
Uh it 's always interesting to read those books .
I always prefer to read those books and mostly prefer the books of Sidney Sheldon because they kind of show some thrilling material .
So I prefer to read those books .
