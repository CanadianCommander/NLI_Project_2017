If were to tell some friends from another country with places to visit in my country in this case Venezuela , I would suggest them to visit first uh the City of Coro because it has a lot of history .
Many beautiful colonial buildings .
It is actually a uh site for MUNESCO .
But if they want to see more landmarks they they could visit the Gran Sabana .
It 's a beautiful beautiful place and and it 's the well the tallest waterfall in the world Salto Angel is located .
It 's a quite a great site so .
