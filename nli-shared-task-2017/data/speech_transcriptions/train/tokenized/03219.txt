Book I read it 's uh The Glasgow Trilogy and it 's a book uh that talks about the city of Glasgow where I lived in one year , I studied there .
So I mean it 's quite uh known , I mean it 's quite important for me uh the culture of this town and uh the thing they talk about I feel them very close to me um because they um uh respect the reality of that town .
And uh um the book is about uh the three novels and uh in every page um in every page I 've seen .
