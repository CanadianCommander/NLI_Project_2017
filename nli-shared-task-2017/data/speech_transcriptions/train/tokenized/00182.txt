When I was in high school I was one of the representatives of my class and my class chose me to be sent to participate in a debate of human rights and to impose and imply our new ideas and changes we want in , in our world and especially on human rights .
I think that was a great opportunity for me since I always wanted to fight for human rights , since I always heard stories told or read about victims around the world or even victims in our country .
