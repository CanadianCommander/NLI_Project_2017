So when um uh uh far away from her I miss her so much .
The second thing that I really miss uh is uh my dog .
His name is and uh he 's a wonderful bulldog and uh he 's like uh a member of the family .
So for this reason when uh I 'm uh traveling in another country , I really miss him and all the time I asked my mother .
