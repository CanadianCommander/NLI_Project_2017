I 've been asked to say what is most , most about uh about my home away .
I think uh the the most difficult the major difficulty for to when I 'm away is uh not having my things in that place I mean when you are going to another place you have to put your things in up in in a pla - in some places that you are not used to and that make you problems um to find them .
Um mainly that 's what I miss most about my home when I whenever I 'm away .
