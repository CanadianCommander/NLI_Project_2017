Um actually if some friends were coming to Colombia , I would suggest for them to go first of all to Cartagena which I think my opinion is very many most beautiful city in Colombia .
Also I would suggest to come to Bogotá which is capital in their many cool things to do and I feel those two places are really most important places to visit in Colombia .
Um I will also have to say that in Cartagena as well as in Bogotá there are great hotels where they can be and many things to do restaurants and many couple of things to do in both of them .
