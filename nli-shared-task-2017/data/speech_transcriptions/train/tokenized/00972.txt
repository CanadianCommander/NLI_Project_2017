Cooperation is I think the most important qua - quality a valuable team member has to have because that cooperation no team can succeed the val - meaning of being a team is dependent upon the cooperation in it and while individuals may lack the ability to overcome the problems or the issues alone , within the team if the cooperation is sufficient then they maybe able to get over the problem .
And this is why I think cooperation is the m - value or most important .
