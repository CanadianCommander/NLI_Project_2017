In the first year of my university education , that is my undergraduate education , I opted to be the president of the uh curriculum club which is the club which deals with extra curriculum activities in our college .
Under my ages , the club won many uh curri - co-curri - extra curriculum activities and this led to me being declared the beast uh extra curriculum guy in our college .
This , for this I have worked very hard and my team management skill s have come to the fore .
Also my inspiration and motivation skills have help me and I feel that this is my greatest accomplishment .
