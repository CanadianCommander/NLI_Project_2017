I think that an important value , a quality to be a member of group , is um the capacity you have to hear to the other one .
I think that when you 're in group , um the purpose is sharing ID and to make a good work , you need to have this capacity to hear and to let the other one express their opinion .
I do n't know if personally I have this quality , but I used to be in many different groups and team and I have experience that .
This quality is I think the best qualities to succeed and to be a member of a group .
