Seoul is the capital city of Korea and if the foreign foreign friends come to Korea and ask me to introduce them place in Korea I would suggest Seoul because uh was capital city of Korea for six hundred years and we have so many things to see and watch .
And we have a lot of things about our culture .
And also Seoul is the biggest city in the Korea we have one ten billion people here and lots of cars and maybe it will be very great experience for her or him .
