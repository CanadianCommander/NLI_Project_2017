I think one of the most valuable uh characteristics of a member of a team is responsibility , because a member who has this quality can encourage people to do the work as they should do it .
Uh this member can assign different task to every member of a group and it 's uh good to have assigned , because they , each member has , uh knows what to do in , for the good performance of the , of the group .
So , responsibility is , what I think it 's more , more important .
