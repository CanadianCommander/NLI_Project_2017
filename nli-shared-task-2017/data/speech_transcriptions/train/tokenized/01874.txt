When I 'm away from what I most miss is the company of my parents , both my mother and my father as well as the company of my grandparents .
Uh when I 'm away I can of course continue to to communicate with my parents through email and telephone but it 's not quite the same as being at home and spending time with them , walking along with them and so on .
Another thing I miss sometimes is the food that we can have at home especially certain kinds of food that like broken rice which which are not easy to easily available in the market .
Uh I also miss some of the friends who are , who live close by near my home and with whom I 've spend a lot of my childhood .
So overall , there are many things about home that I miss when I am away .
