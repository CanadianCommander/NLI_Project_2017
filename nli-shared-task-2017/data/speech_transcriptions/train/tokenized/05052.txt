Yeah my favorite book is Fight Club from Chuck Palahniuk .
And I enjoyed this reading this book because it uh contains uh lot of social critic .
And yeah , you read this book and you just think yeah , that 's right and but you never ever thought about that point of the society .
And I think that uh this book really opens the arise about what uh problems your society really is worth .
And another aspect is that uh the characters are really freaked out so you can uh really love about uh the things they made .
And I think this is really entertaining .
