Uh when my friends are uh coming to visit me in my country , I would recommend them to visit Istanbul because an ancient city .
And uh they can visit old museums and uh , uh and historical places .
Also Istanbul is a place where continents meet .
So it 's it is very historical , it 's , it 's a metropolitan and do whatever they want .
Um it has a lot of sight seeing places , it has a lot of uh social activity oriented places .
Uh they can do what they want and uh there is a lot of things to do to explore Istanbul .
So I 'd really to recommend Istanbul for them .
