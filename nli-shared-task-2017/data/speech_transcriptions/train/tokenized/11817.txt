Interesting book that I once read was History of Frank Lloyd Wright who a great architecture .
His famous was planning because as architecture student I 'm inspired in so many ways .
So that was a great book I 've read up to now .
He did so many projects like wat - falling water which is a famous one .
As architect student I learned so many things from that book .
So that was interesting book that I read in my life .
