The preferred book which I have read is Mahabharata .
This is an Greek-Indian epic .
This is about a kingdom and the supposed owners of the kingdom which are the groups of two cousins .
One group consist of , consists of hundred of brothers and other consist of five brothers .
They fight for the kingdom and at last the group which consist of five brothers finally wins the war and and gets the kingdom occupied .
