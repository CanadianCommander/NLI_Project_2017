The most , the most things I miss about when I will away from home is my parents and uh the home food and of course the friends .
Uh parents being the sense whenever I will be using , when - whenever I will be in trouble I can , being at home I can go and ask them for what should I do and what should I not .
They 'll say to me the way the proper thing .
And for home food the they will make , mother make the food and she will give us and uh it will be quite tasty and everything will be done quite efficiently by parents and uh friends of course .
The third thing is the friends which I believe mostly missing uh being away from home .
