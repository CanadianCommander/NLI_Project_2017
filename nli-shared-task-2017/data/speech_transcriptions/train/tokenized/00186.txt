I recently read the book from Jack Welch that tells Straight From the Gut .
Actually , I liked the book because it is , it talks about the practical scenarios which we face uh day to day and gives us the birds eye view of how they evolved from the beginning and how it changes , changed it 's strings of business .
It changed from the actual electric which was a coal business to diversified itself to various other business and segments which were new to him .
And how it continuously uh acquired new firms which were making more profits and how , why it closed which were not performing well .
