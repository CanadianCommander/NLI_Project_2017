My favorite book The Catcher in the Rye .
Um the it 's a journal by Holden Caulfield and he is a young man who is against the society .
I think this book is really interesting because it shows a different perspective about society and about people .
It mainly talks about how people lie in order to get what they want .
Uh Holden throughout all the book he writes about his persona - personal experiences .
Um for example he describes all the schools to which he went to and he describes the different people he met .
