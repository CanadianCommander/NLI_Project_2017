I like to rea - read uh novels such as short history of time and the novels which are in fact non-fiction books in the novels format .
I really love reading this kind of material because it 's very intellectually stimulating and it takes me into a totally different stream what I 'm currently studying .
A short history of time with is a short history of nearly everything on scientific topics topics so it gives you a lot of grab on something which is totally different from what you normally do .
Similarly was a uh an a wor - was a work of history which describe the interaction of the British with the < % > society and I found it very interesting from cultural perspective .
It give us a view point about how people looked at the point of time .
