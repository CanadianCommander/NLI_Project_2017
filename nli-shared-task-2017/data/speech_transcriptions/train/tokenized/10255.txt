The book that I have read recently is Fountainhead by Ayn Rand and I think this is the best book because me being an architect the book has completely about architect and the architect Howard Roark who is the leading hero of the novel and the , it 's about him and his life story and how he deals with the architectural projects and how he faces the problems .
It has been written with good detail and philosophical details in it and good research has been done before writing this by the writer Ayn Rand .
This book is the best in , if it shows architectural values and the way the architectural projects are dealt with so I think it is the best book I 've ever read .
