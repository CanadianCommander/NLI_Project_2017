I wanna recommend for someone who come from other country to spend the time in my country is that Seoul in Korea .
It is a capital and big city .
So it has uh a lot of uh museums , entertainers and the convenient transportation .
Even though yeah , they are uh foreigner and unfamiliar with the the city .
