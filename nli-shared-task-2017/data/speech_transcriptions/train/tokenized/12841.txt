I like to uh to read poetry because uh it is not so easy to find uh time to read uh some poems .
You just have to uh um uh have to have uh um half an hour like that .
Um also uh it is good for thinking .
You can think all around different subjects uh not uh always uh just reading .
And for this reason , it is also not so hard .
So so you do n't have to uh think about uh complicated subjects .
