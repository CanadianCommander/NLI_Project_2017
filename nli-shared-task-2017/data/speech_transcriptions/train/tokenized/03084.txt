Um um um a year , uh five years ago we moved to Italy and we were hoping to stay more than a year .
So we went to an Italian school and at that time and knew no Italian , not at all .
So I went to this class and I hardly understood anything .
A teacher came um came home every two days for two hours and all I do is Italian .
Um this was my accomplishment .
I actually learn Italian in three months .
Being in there and with a teacher and now I can have a conver - a conversation with an Italian person and understand everything .
