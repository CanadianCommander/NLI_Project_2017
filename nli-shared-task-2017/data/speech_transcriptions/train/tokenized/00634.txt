Uh the most important thing I miss when I was not at my , in my home is uh the fufu , one of our special food in Ivory Coast in west Africa .
I like so much uh this , I 'm fond of these food , I like it very much .
And when I was in another county it was difficult for me to , to have these kind of food to eat and uh to eat uh let me to , to think about my , my country because I was not at my country .
Uh to think about this uh food I miss it very much when I was away .
