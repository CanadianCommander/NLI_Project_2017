I 'd like to speak about the opportunity I was given when I came to UAE about a year ago .
Um the opportunity I was given is that I came here to train some local new fire fighters .
Uh something I was hoping to do for a couple of years back in Germany um and apart from that that is the drop out , I came here < % 23.3 > in new country .
Uh I 've never been to the Arabic world before , um I interested in cultural , I studied European culture back in Germany .
And when I came here I found that the Arabic culture is completely different and this opportunity to learn this culture if you know it is great .
