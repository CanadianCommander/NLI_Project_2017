The thing that I miss most when I 'm away from my home is my family .
And especially my mum .
I miss everything about her .
The food prepared by her , by her .
The way she pampers me , she loves me .
She fulfills all my needs .
Then I also miss the time we spend together with the games we play together .
The time I spend with my sister , my father discussing about things of life what I need to life .
The , then I also miss the evening teas and um short naps together with my sister .
And uh I miss my friends with whom I used to spend a long time chatting on phone or going for a walk together during evenings .
Uh then I um miss uh .
