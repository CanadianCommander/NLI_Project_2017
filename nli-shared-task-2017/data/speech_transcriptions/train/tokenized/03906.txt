I think fairness is a very important quality that a team member should have .
For example in sports , when you 're playing in a team , it is important to help each other .
Uh you should support uh your team members when they have troubles and uh teach them your skills if you have more skills if you have more skills than they have for example .
Uh secondly , you should accept others people 's success for example in soccer , uh if someone marks goal , you should congratulate your team member and um yeah do not sh - want to steal the show to to others and want to be the star of the group but uh show compassion to your teach members .
And that is why I think that fairness is one of the most important qualities for a valuable member of a team .
