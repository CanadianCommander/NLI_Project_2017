The most interesting book I 've I have read is Guest in Culture .
The first reason is , it covers all the different cultures in all other kinds of countries except country Korea .
It had a chance to look into the problems they may pose in other countries .
Another reason is , they also talked about the conflicts in the world around .
So I can focus on those issues that bring people to think about it .
For these reasons , Guest in Culture in is my most interesting worldwide .
