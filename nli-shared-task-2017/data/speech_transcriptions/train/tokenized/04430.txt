I think uh if I have to choose a quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team I would certainly choose uh honesty because honesty is one uh quality that really keeps a team together .
Uh if you go to think of a team that in which the members are not honest then it 's more of a chaos where communication is a problem , their trustworthiness among the team members is a problem and uh and finally uh the team does n't remain a team .
It 's more of uh incoherent uh um entities which are trying to work uh uh independent of each other so I think honesty is the quality that I would go for .
