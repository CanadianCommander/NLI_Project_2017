It was a very , very interesting book because Albert Einstein was one of the most uh popular and know physician of the world today .
He invented the twelve , the theory of gravity , relativity and uh the world because uh since then the nuclear was possible , the nuclear bomb was possible .
And we know the consequences about the world since seven world war so it was very interesting to , to know uh about .
