Well one opportunity that was given for me was to go to Madrid to work with uh , uh with engineers and architects .
It was very important for me because I want to do engineering and also uh I like the architecture .
And it was very important because there I can have a practice to show what I 'm going to work if I study arc - architecture or engineering .
Uh what 's the life and the the importance of one engineer or one architect , and there I decide that what I 'm going to do is engineering that is my favorite uh degree .
