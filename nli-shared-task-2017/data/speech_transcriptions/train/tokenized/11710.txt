If people from my country uh were coming to this country , I suggest them to go to Miami because in Miami they can enjoy all the beaches , the beautiful beaches that Miami has , and there is a lot of places pla - places to go to get fun like discos , restaurants and other stuff that they can enjoy like parks .
Um and Miami um actually has the possibility to speak the the the same language that they speak .
So they probably do n't get lost .
