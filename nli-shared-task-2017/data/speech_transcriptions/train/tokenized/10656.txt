If you do n't have the passion you will not , you will not want to do anything .
And the second the , the second quality of the member of the team is the you should do things very carefully .
Because a team sometimes we will discuss in a team is sometimes we will ma - we may miss something so if you are very careful if you have a careful personality you may be very successful in a team .
