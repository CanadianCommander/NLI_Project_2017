Probably one of the most impor - interesting book that I have read about having always a favor .
What interest me about this book is that uh it depicts war in a very uh special way .
It is , it involves a romantic story yet at the same time while explaining some of the difficulties that Hemingway himself faced in world war one .
And um it is really about war and peace not only about war .
Uh it gives um , very im - important ideas to , to reader about the uh , difficulties that people may face in war times and how war actually is like .
