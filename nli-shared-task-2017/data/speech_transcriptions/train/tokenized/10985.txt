 away from home , I missed all my family .
I miss sitting with him with them also I miss the foods which my mom make .
Also I miss my rooms and all the comfortable place I take uh my rest in it .
So in uh missing my home I 'm missing a lot of things .
I 'm missing the compartments , families my brothers .
I do n't know to have to uh make a lot of time from my when I came back , I felt happy and so I had to get check all the house what I missed before I traveled abroad .
