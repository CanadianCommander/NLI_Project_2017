I think Harry Potter is the most interesting book I have read up till today .
It is written by J.K Rolling who is one of the best selling authors of the world and currently in the list of the richest women of the world .
This book takes us to a magical world where everything is different from the things we experience in our day to day life .
This uh this book enables us to go to a completely different side of our imagination and uh and uh fantastic expression of the magic which we can bring in our lives .
And it is also a very , it can not be put down and it is an amazing book .
