I advice them to Istanbul in which I live in because it has some historical places like mosques , church and and other buildings that belongs to the uh religious uh people and it and it 's very uh crowded city and it resembles the whole country .
I think there is they can see picture of Turkey if they see Istanbul .
It will give them an uh very good opinion about Turkey because it will be very easy to see the whole picture in a um just looking at Istanbul perspective .
