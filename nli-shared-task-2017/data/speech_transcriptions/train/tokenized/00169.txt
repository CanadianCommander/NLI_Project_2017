When I 'm uh away I miss my family most because um I love them so much especially my brother , I like spending time with my brother .
And I also like the food my mum cooks .
Because she always cooks delicious food .
And when I 'm away I ca n't find those kinds of foods my mum cooks especially in , in a big city it 's hard to find homemade food .
And maybe third thing I miss is my couch because I like my couch at home .
I like to sit on it and watch my favorite TV shows .
I ca n't be as comfortable as possible when I 'm away .
And I also my , miss my DVD collection .
I have a DVD collection at home .
And at night especially I like to lie down and watch my favorite DVDs and spend time with my family .
I also miss my dog .
