I like book which was very interesting about uh how uh Earl Woods who is Tiger Woods father uh educated Tiger to be a great golfer .
Uh his experiences about how to train the Tiger was very interested me because he uses Vietnamese soldiers training method for his uh uh training uh in the golf game .
He made it a lot of uh different kind of culture education .
