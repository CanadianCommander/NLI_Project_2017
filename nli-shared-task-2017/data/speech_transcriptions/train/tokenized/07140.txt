My great accomplishment in my um well past was uh to study uh German and Polish law at the same time .
It was great because um I managed it although the professor did not believe in my um ability to study both and I really was happy to prove different .
I uh studied for three years now and it really works out really well but I had to put a lot of work and it was really really hard for me .
But um the more satisfactory it was to hold my bachelor of German-Polish law in the end .
