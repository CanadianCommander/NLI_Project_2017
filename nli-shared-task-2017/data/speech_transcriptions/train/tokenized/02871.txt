There 's a book a read about , uh was about a university exam that is in Turkey and it talks about how the university exam is not fair and it should be changed , and it should be separated into eleven particular steps of different tests for different topics and I thought the book was very interesting and I was also interested about , uh interested about the book because the book tells a lot about uh what I ha - I 'm struggling right now which is the exam .
So it 's a great book and I advise you to read it .
