The last year I was uh staying in Italy and I miss my home very much .
And uh I miss especially my mum 's meal uh lunch and the meals that I had eaten before going Italy .
And uh I missed the comfortable life that I had , had lived uh in my family home .
Uh and especially uh I missed my parents and my sister and dog and uh brothers .
Uh it 's a little bit hard uh to live away from home .
