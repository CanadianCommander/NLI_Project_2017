As far as I 'm concerned I wanted to be a professor , because firstly I think li - the live on campus is good and simple .
There are , there is not so much competition on campus , so I can work very comfortably .
Second , my interest is reading .
If I 'm a professor I can read a lot of books an materials , especially on my ma - my major sociology , is very wonderful .
Finally , I think I have no page , I have no good characteristic of being professor that is patience .
I have the confidence to be a very good professor in the future .
All in all I think I wanted to choose to be a professor in the future .
