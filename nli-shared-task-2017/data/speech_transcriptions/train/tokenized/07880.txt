Most people would say that their family , they miss their friends .
As when I 'm abroad , I tend to have new frie - friends since I ca n't have my family .
But as Italian , I must admit that what I miss the most is some good Italian food .
Especially food coming from my region .
Uh my favorite one which I miss the most is pasta .
And especially the way my grandmother 's , grandmother cook it .
And I 'm so crazy about pasta so much into it , but sometimes I even have it for breakfast which is a bit unweird because normally , usually you need to put it on top of pasta .
