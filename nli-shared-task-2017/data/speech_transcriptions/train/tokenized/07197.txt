When I 'm away from my home what I miss the most is the food that my mother makes for me .
There 's nothing can compare to the food of uh the food prepared by your mother .
The second thing that I miss is the love and the compassion that I get from my family , my parents my sisters .
Also the fun of being together the time we use to spend together at the dinner table or otherwise when we use to go out together as family trips .
The last but not least is the facilities that you have at home like laundry washing dish uh your dishes are done etcetera .
