I was able to read before school so I started reading books quite early .
Um first of all , I started um with reading adventure stories that were written for children and when I acme to high school I turned to more uh literature type of books .
Today , I 'm I 'm reading university books most of the time .
There 's no time left for other books in literature or uh entertainment stories exce - except my holidays then I read books of like John Grisham or famous um writers .
