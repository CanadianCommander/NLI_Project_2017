Well , I believe that working capa - , capability is something really important for a member of a team as uh you have to be able to work sometimes not only for yourself , but for the rest of the group as uh , for example in a Masters Degree when you 're asked to , to work in , in group or , or in teams , uh there are some people that do not work as much as the other .
So , you have to , you have to be able to work for , for your colleagues as well , ` cause you know mo - , most of the times uh the grade depends on the whole group not as to all , in a tall member just uh individually considered .
Uh , in addition to that , you have to be patient .
It 's very important to be patient and to try to understand everybody else in the group .
