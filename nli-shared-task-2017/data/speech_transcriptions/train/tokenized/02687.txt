I think it 's very important for a team or for a member of the team yeah to talk about problems friendly .
If there are some things that should be discussed they should do it and that 's yeah , that 's the only way they can understand each other .
I uh for me it 's also very important that if you have a meeting with everyone is punctual .
Punctuality is important for me .
Um yeah um a member yeah everyone should take care of each other and there are always stronger members in a group and always weaker members and they should um try to help each other .
