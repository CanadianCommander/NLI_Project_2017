In my free time I like to read novels and also books .
Mostly books in French because right now I learn French so I want to learn more about this language so I 'm reading these books .
And the journal I 'm mainly reading because I want to be up to date with the news or what is going on around the worl - globe and so I also read the journal .
Um the books I like more because they give uh richer story and not just for the information value but also for the entertainment for it .
And uh I can read in the metro to save time which is nice .
