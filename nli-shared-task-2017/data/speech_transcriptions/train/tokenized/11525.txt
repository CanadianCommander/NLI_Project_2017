Is that I a computer project under the summer undergraduate research awards , that is kind of reward given in an uh institute making a model .
And in that project I fabricated a system of robots .
So for that I had learn a lot of things uh that were uh apart from the knowledge that branch which is mechanical engineering uh to learn a lot of electronics and in that case I had to go through a lot of uh websites and books to learn more .
And also as it was a fabrication based project , uh it involved a lot of hard work in accumulating the things and as we had decided to make it in the most economic manner , we tried hard uh to the best of our ability to find things which are suited best economical .
