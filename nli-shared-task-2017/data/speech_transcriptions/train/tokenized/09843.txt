If I can have any job in the world I would choose to be doctor specifically an internist .
I like this job because I can save people , as a doctor I can also ben - I can also benefit my family members .
Because if they get sick I can help them and tell them what 's wrong with them and give her - and prescribe the the right medicine to help them get better quicker , quickly .
And also my friends would , I would also have doctor friends and if I ca n't help them I can at least refer them to a right person in a very short amount of time .
