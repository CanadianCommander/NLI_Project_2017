Recently I read The Perfume by Patrick Suskind , a German author .
Um it tells a story of a serial murderer who lives in the middle age in France .
Uh I did really enjoy reading this book uh because it stimulated my imagination .
Uh it plays with the senses um because um the main character murders because of the smell of the people .
And so it quite interesting .
