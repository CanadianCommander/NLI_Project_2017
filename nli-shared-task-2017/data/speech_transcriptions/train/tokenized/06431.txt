I personally like to read novels that are concern European and American literature because these are the countries I 'm most interested in .
It 's the same with the magazines es - esp - especially like to read political magazines ad economical-based magazines because these kind of magazines can help me to understand uh what 's going on in the world especially in the US , Europe and Asia .
In terms of poems , I see poems as uh as an art , as an expression of beauty and therefore I choose the poems that I 'm reading based on the , on on on how they how they appear to me , if they are good or not .
