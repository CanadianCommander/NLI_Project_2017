First of all , I would show uh my uh city Heidelberg to visitors from foreign country because it is uh really , really beautiful .
Afterwards uh I think I will show then the black forest because it is a great example of nature and country side in southern Germany .
I would like it really much and after that I would take them up to Hamburg because uh the northern part of Germany is quite uh different from the southern and to because of closer view of that too .
And maybe afterwards uh I take my visitor to Berlin because that is really modern , most modern city in Germany .
