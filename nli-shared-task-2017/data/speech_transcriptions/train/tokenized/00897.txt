I actually had a friend who come to Buenos Aires last year .
I 'm from Argentina I will suggest to come to my city , Buenos Aires is a really amazing city .
There are a lot of culture difference , there are a lot of cinemas , theaters all around Buenos Aires .
We also like a great passion which is sports , we re - really like football most , we most mostly play football .
So that you should uh come to Buenos Aires is just test that football passion and going to theaters and cinemas all around .
And please do n't forget to check out the libraries , they are really amazing , outstanding .
