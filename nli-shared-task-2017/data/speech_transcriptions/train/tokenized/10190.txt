I think unity is one of the most important qualities in a in a person from or or the people from a group because because unity is what make a group is what makes a group .
Without unity , you ca n't really have a group and you ca n't really make things right or things the way they should be .
Unity , when you have unity in a group it also has honesty and communication .
And communication is the key for unity to exist in a group which will make it more easier and more efficient in sort of a job or work that you 're doing .
