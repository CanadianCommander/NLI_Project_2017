An interesting boot book I have read was a novel Seven Years in Tibet by Heinrich Harrer .
And this describes it uh history in Tibet and stay for a long time in love .
And I like this book because it tells me something about the culture of Tibet and they way they can learn a lot of things for about also learn about religion of Tibet and early um life of Dalai Lama .
So Heinrich Harrer was there and several years and um has sometime with Dalai Lama and so he can he described it in the book very good .
