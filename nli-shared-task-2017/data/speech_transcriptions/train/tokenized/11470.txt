Um first of all is the family , I have always been living at the , I 've always lived at home with my my parents and family is something that I definitely miss uh being with them , talking , telling them even the uh all the uh all the details of what I do in in everyday .
It 's something that I really miss , it 's it 's having uh your true co - confidence away that the is something that you really miss when you are away .
Also having your friends away from you is something that is uh , is hard on you .
