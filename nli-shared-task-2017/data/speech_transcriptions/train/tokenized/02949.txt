I miss my family things I do everyday seeing my family , the familiar things which you do like kind of like the traditions like you go in the bathroom , you go out with your dog , you see the same streets you know everything around this area , you see your friends .
And you just like be so much familiar if your way everything is new everything is altered to you , and you know it like you can kind of you can know what is gong to happen and everything and that is what I miss when I 'm gone just not being secure because you do n't really know what is going to happen in the next moment .
And when you are home you know everything is so good , because you lived there for so long you just be familiar with everything .
