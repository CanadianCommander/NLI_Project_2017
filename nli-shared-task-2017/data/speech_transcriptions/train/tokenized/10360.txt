The things I miss most when I 'm away from home are first of all my family because uh they kind of represent everything to me .
Number two is the place where I live .
It is very sunny and I do miss the beaches and going round and having picnics with the people and enjoying time .
Uh especially the beach where I do swim a lot .
Uh and then comparing to where I 'm staying in the United Kingdom is very cold at the moment .
Uh another important thing is cooking .
I really do miss uh my kind of family cooking at home um .
