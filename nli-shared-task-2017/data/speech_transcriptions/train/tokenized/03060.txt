I most likely to I like to to read reviews and research papers .
Because it 's part of my job and I need the information I can get out of there .
And uh you know it 's interesting because most of the papers are directly connected to my area of research and then I can uh gain new ideas and uh learn about uh new methods and and uh practical approaches to design new experiments uh .
