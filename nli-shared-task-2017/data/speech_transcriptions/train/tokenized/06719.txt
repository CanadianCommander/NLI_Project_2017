Uh one of the most interesting books that I ever read is The Lord Of The Rings from uh J. R. R. Tolkien .
Uh I specifically find this book very interesting because of its uh um what it 's all about .
It 's not uh very much like other books I have read before because it contains uh fantasy uh and uh vari - different types of elements like magic and and supernatural things .
Um for example magic uh dragons and other magical issues so this is why I like find it interesting .
