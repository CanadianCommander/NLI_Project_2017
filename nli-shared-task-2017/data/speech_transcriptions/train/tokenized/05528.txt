If my friends come from other country visit I always suggest them to visit the place known as Hyderabad where I live in .
It is one of the beautiful places situated near the coastal regions .
It 's the historical capital of Andhra Pradesh which is situated in India .
The fi - mainly I would like to suggest this place because is the it sends stories .
It contains so many folds many temples many museums to view around .
Secondly it 's educationally well established , infrastructure and transportation are well laid in the city .
The jobs are also plenty and many students come over here from different places to study .
So I definitely like uh my friends to visit Hyderabad for .
