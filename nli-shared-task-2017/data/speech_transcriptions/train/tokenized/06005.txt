I miss most about my home uh my family especially my parents , um when I am away uh it is uh not easy always to find a telephone or find an Internet connection .
Um so often uh you feel alone and um maybe when you are away there are no friends , and uh um you need someone to talk .
So sometimes it 's uh quite difficult um to , to get in connection to get in touch with people .
And um also I miss uh my room , I love my room and um .
