Well I think the most interesting book I have read is Intermediary Accounting .
Also it is a textbook of my major .
I think it is very interesting because my core goal is to become an accountant in the future and I love accounting very .
Whi - while I 'm reading such book um I can study a lot of examples given by this book .
The book gives specific details about how to deal with those extra problems an accountant will encounter in practice and it tells me how to deal with it as well as why should I deal with it in this way .
From this book I have read a lot about and I feel I 'm I 'm enjoying the book very much .
