Unfortunately I 'm not a reading person uh so in my spare time I rarely uh hardly read .
So I just like magazines and in every time if I am sitting in the train or waiting for some um tube or uh I do n't know because magazines , you know , get the the information you 're the from the from the people who are , from the stars and everything like that .
That 's it 's just novels are poetry is kind of different and you need a lot of time to read it .
So since I do n't have the time or I I do n't want to spend much time for reading , it 's I just prefer magazines .
