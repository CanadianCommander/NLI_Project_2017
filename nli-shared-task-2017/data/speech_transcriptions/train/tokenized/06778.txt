Away from home I really miss my family because I have a really contact , really good contact with them and I really like them and love them .
I also do miss my grandma and my dog because they 're both really old , and I 'm always afraid that they um are going to die soon .
So I 'm really afraid and I 'm really happy when I always see them go back to free where I live .
Um I also feel very comfortable at home in my room , and um everything uh um things are um myself , so um I really like it there .
Um I really like my bed , I have a lot of bed , and it 's really comfortable and big .
So that makes it um really bad when I 'm gone to .
