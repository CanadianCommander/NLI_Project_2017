I will be very glad that a friend came to visit me in Paris the city that I live .
Uh I think the most beautiful city all over the world uh I will bring him of course to all the monuments which are famous in Paris such as the Eiffel tower , The Conciergerie or .
But uh I think I will also bring him to visit my friend and I will bring him to my favourite bars so I think it will be a very very hard weekend for him
