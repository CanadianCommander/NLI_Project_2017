I missed about my home when I 'm away from it uh I miss atmo - atmosphere of my home and of coarse I miss my homely father and mother and my older brother and older sister cause they are re - really kind to me and they teach me a lot .
And I really missed my dogs , my pets cause I really like them and and I play with them really a lot at my home so .
