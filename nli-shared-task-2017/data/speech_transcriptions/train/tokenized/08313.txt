When I 'm away from home what I miss most is my family because I am really close to them , and when I do n't see them is like something is missing .
And uh also my friends because I spend a lot of time with them hanging out outside and I 'm used to see them everyday .
So when I do n't see them , it feels like it 's not normal .
And also I miss my city because when you 're used to living somewhere and having habits of living there , you just miss everything when you 're not there anymore .
