I think uh uh quality for a member of a team is creativity .
I think creativity can be considered a very good quality for uh a member of a group because of many different reasons .
The first reason is that , a member who is very creative stimulates the creativity of other members of the group and uh also uh stimulates discussions uh about uh anything that the group is working on .
A second reason why I think creativity is a good quality for a member of a group is that any work that the group is involved uh will give the best .
