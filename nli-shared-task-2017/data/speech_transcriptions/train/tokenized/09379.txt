I read the book uh Tales of Space which was written by P.L Edgarsson .
I think this is a very interesting book because it um tells me or told a lot of um astronomy and I 'm very interested in astronomy .
Um it covers a lot of details of the space , it um points out um wrong um the wrong information which are often um displayed in the public and it 's very good written .
So it a fantastic book to read .
