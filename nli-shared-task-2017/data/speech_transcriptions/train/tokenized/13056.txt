Opportunity that was given to me it was going to University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
And it was important for me because it 's uh one of the successful universities in on the whole world .
So but I did n't , I gave up the opportu - opportunity because uh I have uh better opportunities than it uh I think it 's uh uh it 's hard to go away from your country .
