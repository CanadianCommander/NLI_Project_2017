One of the accomplishment that really important to me in my life , uh was the examination , the common entrance examination for my admission into graduation .
This was a very important stage of my life and I really had to get a very good rank in it in order to uh get an admission into a proper and a well recognized graduate institute .
It required great amounts of hard work uh not only uh physically , but mentally as well .
Uh this is even more important and then in fact it was much harder because apart from the co - exa - the coaching that I had to take for the examination and my preparation for the examination , I also had to attend my second year of intermediate , which is the twelfth standard .
