What I miss most about my family when I 'm not home is the meals we spend together .
My mom is an excellent cook and when she cooks the whole family comes together and meet on the table , we have some food , we talk about politics or what everyone experienced during the day and so the whole family comes together and exchanges information about what they have experienced .
Other topics we talk about are uh sports or different politics and everyone says his opinion and this getting together of the whole family is what I miss most when I 'm away from home because I 'm living alone right now and I do n't have somebody to talk about topics like that .
