The very interesting book I have read recently is called Kicking Away the Ladder and it describes how development occurs in different parts of the world .
And the main thesis of the book is that um richer countries , more developed countries right now require certain types of governance , behavior and economic systems in these less developed countries which they themselves never had when they were at the same stage of development .
In other words these richer countries are kicking away the ladder they themselves have cli - climbed up um in order to uh to uh force these poor countries to stay on their .
