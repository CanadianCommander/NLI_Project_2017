It 's instead in a library and it includes stories about ghost and a bit of time travel and I thought it was just beautifully written and had a lot about love in it and concepts of how love transcends time and people can stay in love uh even after they are dead or ex - explore that love even after they 're dead .
As well as it 's um some talking about a young man of fifteen years who runs away from home and um finds shelter in that library and how he struggles to come to terms with his life and his dead and .
