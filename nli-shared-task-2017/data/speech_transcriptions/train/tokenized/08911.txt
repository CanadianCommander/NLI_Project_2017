A very special opportunity that has been given to me is actually my coming to the Middle East .
Uh I had a choice to stay in my country or come uh to the Middle East and UH for work actually .
And um working in a multi cultural environment , having uh , uh a team work and working in English was the main points that were very important to me .
And I would like to emphasize the fact that uh the melting pot that some countries in the region represent were also a great opportunity to uh construct myself .
