A very special opportunity that was given to me was the possibility to train for a month with the mathematics national team .
This was really important for me , because I learned a lot of mathematics during that month .
I greatly improved my knowledge of mathematics , and it also allowed me to get to know uh a lot of people that are roughly my age .
And that we share uh many of my interests , and with whom is very interesting to relate with , and I really enjoy talking to them and doing things for them .
So this opportunity uh both .
