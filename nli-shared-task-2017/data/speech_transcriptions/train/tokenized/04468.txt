I think the most thing that I missed when I away my home is my parents .
Because I think I love my parents very much .
They take , they take care of me very much from I was a child I 'm not a very good child .
Sometimes I just do n't eat anything I did n't drink the milk , so they pay a lot of attention on me .
They really , uh they really are good parents for me , so that 's why I think if I away of my home , I will miss a lot of my parents .
