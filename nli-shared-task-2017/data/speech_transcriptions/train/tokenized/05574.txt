A quality I think makes someone a valuable member of a team is leadership .
I think it is important quality for a team or group member to have .
Because leadership is completely based on the one who is who is able to manage a team , a group or something like that .
Leadership qualities should be like , he should be able to cooperate , to cooperate with the team members .
Uh the team member should obey him and uh he should be able to manage all the team members by his words .
So according to me a leadership which is able to uh who is able to manage a group or team is valuable and this is the quality I think is valuable .
