When I 'm away from home , what I miss most is my family my mom and dad , my brother and also my dog .
Um I miss our dinners I miss the meals I miss the time I spent together with them , I also miss the food my mother prepares and I also , I often when I 'm away , I often think what they might be doing and uh I think what I will be dong when I 'm back again .
Um I also miss talking to my mother about the problems that I have or even fighting with my brother or walking the dog .
There are a lot of things I miss .
