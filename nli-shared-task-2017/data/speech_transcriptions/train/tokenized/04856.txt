What I miss most when I 'm away from my home is the my bedroom because uh I have always lived in it and so that is a bit difficult to have a new apartment .
Then the atmosphere of the , of the house with my parents and the dinner miss me the .
And finally the space because I live in in a very small flat , so that is a bit different because uh with my home , with my parents I have garden and lots of space to live .
