The accomplishment that required me to very , work very hard was uh to get in admission into IET .
Okay this accomplishment was very important to me because uh I had to clear a joint entrance examination to get into this college .
And this college is like one of the top colleges in engineering in India .
So I desperately wanted to get into it .
So for this I worked very hard uh , I use to study about fifteen to sixteen hours a day and I prepared very well for the maths , physics and chemistry examinations , which were part of the entrance examination for this institution .
