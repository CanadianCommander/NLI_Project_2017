Um when I 'm away from home , I miss the most um my friends and family to have them around me , to support in difficult times .
And more over , I miss German culture and um people of course , my German surroundings , things that make me feel familiar and safe and and sometimes I miss German foods .
Not so often but sometimes especially the variety of German bread which is um which is on all sort of dark bread and whole grain bread which you ca n't find usually in the US or in uh in Japan .
I did n't find it .
