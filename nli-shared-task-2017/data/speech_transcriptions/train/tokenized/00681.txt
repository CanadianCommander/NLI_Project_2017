One of the most inte - interesting books I 've ever read is Wings of Fire from Dr. Abdul Kalam the current Indian president .
Yeah the book really inspired me because he showed how he really struggled during his earlier career and despite all the odds , he was able to come out of it and did something good for India .
That is work for the for India .
And one of the examples how he got frustrated during the preparation for the test missiles in South factory location , he showed that how consistent hard work and preparation ultimately led to the solution of the law and it inspired a lot to me in that sense .
So con - to conclude , this is the book which has inspired the most .
