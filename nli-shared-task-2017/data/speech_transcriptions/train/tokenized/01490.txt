An accomplish that required me to work very hard was to launch an I spend one year in China one year ago and I worked very hard everyday to launch this , it was really extremely important to me because I was in a foreign country and I do n't speak Chinese at all and so learning Chinese very fast was very important because it was the only way to make friends to understand a lesson because I was still in school too .
And it was also the only way for example to communicate with my family because I was staying in a house family and they could n't speak English so it was very important to learn Chinese and it is also important to , to travel because I did many travels and so if uh I can speak Chinese and uh .
