I 've been living in this for almost uh one year now and the thing that I uh miss the most over my family and my life and my room uh uh the the ambiance and uh um the my family I guess , uh my sister uh and especially I think I miss a lot of the .
Um in fact in Paris I mean I can uh cook everything I want but it 's a bit different than uh staying at home and eating having dinner with my family every night and uh and watching TV in Italian .
So this is the thing I I miss most .
