Um if a friend from another country visiting France uh I would suggest them to visit first of all Paris , um first of all I would suggest them to go to the main places , the , the , the well known places such as uh Notre Dame or or um or < % 17.9 > .
That after all the most interesting things I think are the unknown places that only people that have been living in Paris for a long time know .
And I think those places are , are the Paris that lives and not necessarily in the travel guides , you know that are very , that are giving things um that everybody knows that are not necessarily interesting .
