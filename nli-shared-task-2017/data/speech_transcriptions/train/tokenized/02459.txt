The last book that I read was about Africa and the history of a young woman who lived there .
She was European but she lived in Africa .
I found it very interesting this book because you got to know a lot about the people in Africa , about nature and the surroundings and especially the way of life , the acts and behaves .
Also you could get in touch with the culture , culture they had and the way how to survive in these conditions , or under these conditions they lived .
This woman was very brave and she has uh a con - , relationship to a man but she went back home after some years , to Europe .
