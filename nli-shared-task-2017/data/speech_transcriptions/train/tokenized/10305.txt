Special opportunity that was given to me was to enter the ANC college with a scholarship .
But to do that I had to take a TOEFL exam and get a high grade .
The opportunity was really special because the ANC student knows about everything in , in life that 's why I really appreciate the opportunity .
And I will , I am looking forward to be an ANC student and graduate with really good grades to be successful in the future .
