I miss most about my home when away is maybe my bed .
Because um I 'm sleeping in another bed or another room , another home um makes me feel unconfident .
Generally this goes like this and uh I am missing uh my family very much .
I mean uh talking with them after today uh we are making uh talks about how the day goes on .
I miss these very much when I am away from home .
