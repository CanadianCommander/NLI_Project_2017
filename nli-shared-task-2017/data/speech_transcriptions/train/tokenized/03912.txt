Recently I have read a book which is called World of Fools Sleep Eight Hours a Day .
That book is talking about that you should not sleep eight hours for a day because eight hours is too much for us to rest .
Consecutively you should sleep less than eight hours .
For instance the scientist says that four hours is enough for our bodies so you should n't sleep so much and waste our time for more life .
