Well I 'd rather read magazine instead of novels or poetry because magazines has a lot of information about like new world or this day because this day is moving really first , so this is why I will rather read magazine .
But novel well novel is too long to read in short time or free time , I 'll rather read like take another moment and read novel or poetry .
Well personally I do n't like poetry because because poetry um well usually about old story or something something happened before and then about like really making really short space and not cont - is not is is too concise .
So I do n't even like to read poetry .
