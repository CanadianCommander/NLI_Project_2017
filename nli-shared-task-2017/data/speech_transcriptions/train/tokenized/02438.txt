The special opportunity uh that was given to me uh was uh after I became a doctor uh to treat a patient , a serious patient it was the biggest opportunity for me .
It was like a challenge to my education and uh the knowledge which I had received throughout my graduation .
Uh the opportunity uh to treat that patient uh of the asthma and the patient really needed an immediate care and re - uh it was a great responsibility for me .
It is a special opportunity to make uh a person survive and give h√≠m back the health which he had prior to the disease .
