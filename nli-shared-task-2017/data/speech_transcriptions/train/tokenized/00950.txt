Well , my favorite job would be an accountant because accountant 's job is about consistent .
Um it 's just I mean just calculating the math and I think accountant is a proficiency with the um having tests or some kinds of proof , you can be be an accountant then I can I am acco - I am an accountant and this is a proficiency and I can do what you ca n't do .
And this is I think it is very I like the feeling of being a pro and so that 's why accountancy is my favorite job .
