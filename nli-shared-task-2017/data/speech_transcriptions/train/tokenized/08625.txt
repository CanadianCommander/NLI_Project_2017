I miss most um when I am away from my home I miss most uh is comf - comfo - comfort and I think um I miss my room the most because it 's really comfortable for me and I have my computer and my TV there so I can just lay down and uh listen to music from the computer or just watch TV .
And when I 'm away from home I feel like um I 'm not comfortable enough to lay down and just to relax .
So the home my home is the place that I relax .
Um I like to be home I like to be in my room , I like to cook at my own kitchen because I know that everything .
