Opportunity I have , the most special opportunity I have been given was before uh in the middle of my high school period .
Uh after my second year of high school which was in a public school I was given a scholarship from a private high school which was very uh fascinating for me because it includes a lot of uh many facilities , such as a student clubs , sport activities .
On the other hand academic performance was better than the public high school .
This uh , the teachers uh can inform us in a better way and they have a better relationship between , with students and uh they can um whenever you need any help they are open for , to you to help you .
