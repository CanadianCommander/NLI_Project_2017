I 'm a full time dentist and uh I came here in United States last year .
I was given an opportunity to work as a dentist in the community health center .
The community health cente , r uh working in a community health center always attracted me because I wanted to interact with the community and serve the undeserved .
The opportunity I got in working at as a dentist I think it 's a big op - UM step for my goals , for my future goals to work in a community setting and in a public health set up .
And it 's really important because I get exposure .
