I have the opportunity to show some , to go to Guatemala in a missionary trip .
Uh we were about twenty people who were in their sophomore junior and senior year .
Who their one of the most uncivilized and one of the most po - poorly cities in Guatemala .
We helped them perfectionize their educational systems and we helped them gather food , to rebuild the houses .
