I could choose any job I would chose a doctor who helps children .
Um when I was little um a doct - I really hated hospitals , I would run run away if I see a hospital .
However my doctor was really nice and she would give me a sticker every time I go there and by little by little I got used to it .
And I want to help people who are sick and ill and I want to help if I can .
And I want to help children and if they do n't like hospitals I want to be like a doctor who I had .
I want to I want for the to like hospitals .
