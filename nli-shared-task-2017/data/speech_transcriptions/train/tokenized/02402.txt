About an interesting book I have read .
Well in fact I am reading quite a lot so I can not decide right now on a specific one but when I was in the train to where I 'm taking this < % > I was reading a book by uh travel journalist contributing the London Times author called Bill Bryson .
His book 's name is uh I think it was The Little History Of The World and it 's just a extremely hilarious and funny and entertaining book because uh Mr. Bryson um has such a a a very good , high on uh puts so much effort in describing the ties and uh the little scenes which are happening all a happening all a around the world and he has great ability to describe the people which I like very much .
