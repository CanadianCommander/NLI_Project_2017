The thing which I miss the most when I was away from my home was my family members .
I mean they were the support system for me , and I could rely on them in difficult times .
So when I was away from home and alone I did not know whom to turn to and you know and discuss my problems .
And the other thing which I miss the most was the food cooked by my mother .
My mother cooks cooks the best dishes world , and I think no restaurant or no chef or no expert can match to her cooking , so I definitely miss these things .
