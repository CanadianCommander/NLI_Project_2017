The most interesting book I have ever so far was uh Jurassic Park which was written by Michael Crichton .
Well for the first it was very thrilling .
The author was very weired storytelling and um it gives real impression about what what is happening in the book .
Second it was very informative .
Uh Michael Crichton does a lot of research before he read he writes a book .
So um he gives a lot of information in his book .
And finally I could compare all the book with movie and uh get the get get the ideas about um how they are different and they are exciting .
