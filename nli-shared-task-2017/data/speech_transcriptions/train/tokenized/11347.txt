I prefer uh reading magazines since I just think that uh magazines are most up-to-date .
For example , for preparation of this TOEFL iBT , uh I was advised to read a lot of um scientific magazines just to be prepared uh for the topics of uh this test .
So what I just did is to read them .
Moreover , I think uh I have more fun reading magazines than novels which are not really or do n't have to be realistic so I I really prefer reading magazines .
