It 's a good question because actually right now I 'm away from home , uh I 'm taking the test in France and uh I 'm from Montreal Canada .
And what I miss most right now is basically my friends , I hangout with them um I also uh be with my family be in touch with them , at any day instead of playing once in a while with phone calls , phone codes I mean .
Uh also I miss doing my daily routine like going to school , I miss not boarding the bus and stuff .
And , and , and most of all what I miss is um having a sense abou - about home .
