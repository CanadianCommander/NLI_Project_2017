The accomplishment I choose to tell is uh the ability to speak Spanish , um I went to Costa Rica for uh six months and I did not speak one word of Spanish .
So it uh took me a lot of work and a lot of effort to get into the , the language to , to learn he grammar and basically I taught myself .
So uh after all after the six months I saw the success and this is the accomplishment I saw .
It is important to me because it showed me or it , it taught me lots of things about myself and about and how , how far I can learn a new language in a very short time .
