So usually my country is a really beautiful country and there are cities that uh a person that comes from another country has to see and visit such as Roma , Florence Venice , and for me the islands as well .
I really , um if a person from another country came to Italy I would bring him first in Rome .
Because from it is the capital of Italy and it has a lot of culture .
The second city should be Florence and then Venice .
A place that I really like in Italy are the island , uh this little island .
