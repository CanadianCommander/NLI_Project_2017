When I am away uh the thing that I had missed about my home is uh the silence , to be with myself , being alone in my room and eating my mother 's food and uh what else I can say about is is the is the point I can read book alone in my home and in my room and uh without uh uh watching TV maybe .
But uh e - as everyone else mentioned before uh home is where your heart is .
You can prepare for yourself , wherever you go , the same conditions that you want to .
