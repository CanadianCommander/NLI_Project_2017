What I miss most about my home when I 'm away is the love in my home is when I am when I here with my parents either in living either in the living room or uh in the garden uh I specifically like uh being in my garden and watching uh watching the land the the flowers and the plants because my mother uh loves gardening and I love my garden .
Uh I also like uh being in my room and listen to music , uh playing with my computers , uh living my house something I really like and that 's why when I am away uh I miss it so much .
