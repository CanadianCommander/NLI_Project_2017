What I miss most is um the food .
Uh I miss the meals my mother and my grandmother prepare to me in the weekends uh because they cook very well .
Um I also miss my friends because I used to go out with them and we spent a very good time in the pub uh just laughing and telling stories .
Um I also miss my room , which is full of books and it has a very comfortable sofa where I used to sit down and spend hours reading um yes and so on .
Uh I think those are the three things I miss most when I am at home uh abroad .
