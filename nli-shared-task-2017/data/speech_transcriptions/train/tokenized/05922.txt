So okay the only two um magazines I read or the only magazine I read actually are business magazines and most of it I read the newspaper everyday .
So I do n't even read too much business magazine , uh mostly the newspaper everyday and that 's why I 'm studying international affairs and so I have a lot of reading materials from my manager from from because my university .
So there is no time of reading for reading novels or other big books and on my focus on my topics so .
And I would like to read notes though but and there is just no time for that .
It 's like yeah I think it helps me the most if I read newspaper .
