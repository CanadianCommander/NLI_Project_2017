Well , I think unselfish is the most valuable quality people should have in a team .
You know Steve Nash , he is a so great basketball player in NBA , and he is always unselfish .
And he like to pass the ball to his team mate , so make , just to make his team perfect .
So I think unselfish is the most important quality .
And also during work or in study , you should also be unselfish to share your own information with your , uh other members in a team .
Uh you should cooperate with them and then , but not for your own .
