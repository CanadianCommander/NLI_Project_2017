Uh I recommend to go the Kyoto uh in the city of Japan .
There , there are two reasons , the first one is that there are many traditional buildings .
The traditional buildings is basically made up of the wall or something at very old times uh the and you can not see such buildings in other countries .
And another reason is that uh , that there , they have the museum that , um which we can see there many the historical things the the something .
They can learn the history of Japan from that .
