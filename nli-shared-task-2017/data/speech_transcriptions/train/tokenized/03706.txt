Oh well first I would take him to Berlin it 's out capital city .
Um yeah and you know it 's kind of multi cultural there and its high life , it 's very new and modern .
It has been built up new after the another Cold War start start , pretty interest city .
Um after that I probably show them Munich because Munich you know is like this city with most foreigners , like they image about Germany if they 've never been to Germany before .
Like uh you know the October Fest and like that .
Maybe Frankfurt , Frankfurt is well you know very modern city you know it 's a with a sky line in Germany so very nice and maybe my home town which is Creole because it 's the old city found by Rome 's and very interesting .
