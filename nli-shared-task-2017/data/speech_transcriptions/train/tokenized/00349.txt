I was invited to my brother 's graduation ceremony last year .
Um and it was a very nice opportunity I met some of my old friends and I saw some new ones too and I met my old teachers and we were very happy and my brother was , and I was so proud of him because he graduated and now he 's on his way to college and I hope that he will pursue his future to get a be - better career .
And uh because uh I want him to follow the footsteps of my father and my grandfather because they were the same and I hope that he would succeed hopefully .
