I prefer reading magazines rather than novels and poetry .
It is because it is uh more informative than compared to the novels as well as poetry .
It , it is a cheaper source of information and it is also easy to read and understand .
That is because the novels as well as poetry are more more lit - literary that is it is very hard too difficult to normal person .
But whereas in contrast if you see magazines it provides more information in a very crisp and easy language .
So I prefer magazines in the place of novels or poetry .
