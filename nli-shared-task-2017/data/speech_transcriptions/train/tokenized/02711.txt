Opportunity that was given to me would be probably um when I was able to move to America because um I used to live in Japan and I went to Japanese school and I did n't have any opportunities to speak or learn English .
But since I moved here I now I ha - now I go to go to American schools and I have American friends and I get to know much about American cultures not just English .
But the cultures itself and it is great to know about different cultures other than my own culture .
