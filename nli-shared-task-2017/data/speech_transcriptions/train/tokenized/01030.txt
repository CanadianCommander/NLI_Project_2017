i have always been frightened on the stage and this stage freight has also led to , uh has led to a fear of debates .
debates have always been an elusive topic for me , however once in my school there was a debate competition .
I was reluctant to apply but my teacher continuously supported me and encouraged me to apply .
Although it was n't the first time I prepared extremely hard , I memorized all the points carefully and analyzed the topic with deep thought .
However I stood first and this enabled me to overcome my fears of stage freight , it inculcated in me a feeling of responsibility and confidence for the stage freight , for the stage .
