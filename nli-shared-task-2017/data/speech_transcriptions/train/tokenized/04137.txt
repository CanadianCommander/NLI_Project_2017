The big accomplishment I have done in my life is to , is to graduate from the college of pharmacy .
This thing was a huge thing for me because of I uh I have been through a lot , a lot uh the past three years since my father died .
I had to finish my college and then to work to support my family because they are the only thing I have .
So graduating with uh this hard uh situation was something uh I 'm proud of and also my mum and my sisters are proud of .
Uh going to the college of pharmacy was a dream and at , at the end it , it became true .
