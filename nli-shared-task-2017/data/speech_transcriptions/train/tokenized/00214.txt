The chance that I will never never get is like when I was told that I 'm going to work in a college .
Because I was n't prepared to work in a college and a school and I I I did n't like the situation there in the school .
So it was an extra - extraordinary or outstanding chance that I will never forget and because there I can practice my English , I can use a lot of things that I had learned in the university .
And I can encourage people to speak in English , I used my English most of the time .
Where going to school is not a good chance where you have to use your mother tongue to explain things to students .
So it was a really good chance for me to explore my knowledge with uh people who are motivated they want to learn English and so on .
