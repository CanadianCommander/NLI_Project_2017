I would take my friends to Aachen which is a very small town in in the west of Germany and is my home town .
So I can tell them a lot about Aachen .
It is very beautiful small city um and even more beau - beautiful town center .
There are many historic buildings in the center with um interesting hin - history .
For example , the cathedral is very well known and has very beautiful windows .
Uh another reason why I picked Aachen is because Aachen has many beautiful caf√©s where um you can sit and enjoy your holidays .
