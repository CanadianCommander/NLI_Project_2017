Whenever I go out of my place then I miss my family the most .
My parents , my brothers and sisters , my grandparents and the uncles and aunts .
I live in a joint family and I have around thirteen family members .
I enjoy each and every moment spent along with them .
Secondly , I miss my mother 's uh cooked food I love the cuisine , I love the food which she prepares .
I am vegetarian and she cooks awesome food .
After uh like parents and food , I miss mostly the family environment .
It is such a secured environment that you do n't feel when you go outside the world .
When you are outside , you are in .
