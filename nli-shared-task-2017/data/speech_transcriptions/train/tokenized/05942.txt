I was given an opportunity to be a swim team leader when I was a junior in high school .
Um this was a special opportunity for me because it gave me a chance to build leadership that I needed .
And um it was a great opportunity to build responsibility uh because that is important for my future and the career that I want to go in .
Um it also we - made me feel better about myself and build self-esteem that I was able to build leadership and put the team together .
