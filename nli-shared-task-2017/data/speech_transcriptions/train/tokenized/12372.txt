Well , completing my high school was uh uh took me a lot of hard work because I did n't like to go to school and I was n't really fond of learning so actually uh for a pretty long time I did n't do much at school so uh when the end exams came I had to really , to really work hard and to pull up what I , what I did n't do uh before .
And it was important for me to , to pass these exams because uh it would uh would define my future .
I wanted to study so I tried to get uh good marks on my exams .
