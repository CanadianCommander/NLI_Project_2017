The most uh that I miss about my home while I 'm away is obviously my family .
My family consists of my brother and my mother , I just love them .
My brother constantly pesters me , he irritates me but I love it , because we love each other we do that .
And uh the food what my mother makes it 's so amazing you ca n't get this kind of food anywhere else .
Um anywhere else yeah and of course my friends and I also love , I miss the things which my mother asked me all the time .
Like how was your day today ?
Did you have your food on time etcetera .
