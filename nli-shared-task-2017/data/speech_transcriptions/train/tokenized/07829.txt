According to me one of the qualities which make someone a valuable member of a team , is flexibility .
I think that is important for a person to be flexible especially when working with a team , because it is important for you not only to voice your own opinion but also to listen to other people .
Taking to consideration what they , think and suggest not be dogmatic .
And uh unitedly as a team come a consensus about a discussion of a solution to a topic , rather than being argumentative and trying to force your opinion on group .
