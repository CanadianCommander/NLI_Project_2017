I think the enthusiasm is the most important thing for me to accomplish one thing , because if I do n't have en - en - enthusiasm I do n't have lot energy to do everything the way I want .
So if I lose my enthusiasm , I will lose the energy to accomplish the , the work .
And without uh enthusiasm people can not find the truth of a problem .
So if I want to find a , find a , if I want to state a problem I have the , I have to have enthusiasm .
