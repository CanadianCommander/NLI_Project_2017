In my free time I would love reading informative reading such as scientific books because it talks about uh different scientific uh breakthroughs such as one book that I uh most wonderful book I have ever read is called the it talks about the HIV and how it can not be the possible cause of AIDS and it also talks about how millions of people are unclear , unseasonably dying because of the corrupted medical system such books uh give me an insight about how our scientific uh society works and how money alters our perception and decision making .
Thank you .
