In my case , the reason what , the topic that I would choose in which I feel the accomplishment is when I had to go for a mood code .
A mood code is essentially a scenario where a law student is given a hypothetical case and you have to go and argue the case before a judge .
In the instance case I believe it was very beneficial to me as I had to work in a team .
Working in a team as it is saves me time , it saves you many resources , it brings together the best and brings results .
Moreover there is less accountability on an individual than in a team and the team can move ahead with much more efficiency .
