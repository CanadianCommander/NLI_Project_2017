Well an interesting book that I have read is The Da Vinci Code which at some point it can like open my eyes because like it talks about some truth of the church that are maybe like hidden and no one really knows about them and some facts that people do n't just know about them .
So like it kind of like opens your eyes and tells you about these things .
Actually and I also I think that the plot was really good even though it was like a science science fiction .
It the plot is really good , really convincing .
It really gets you in there , gets you to imagine and feel all the things .
