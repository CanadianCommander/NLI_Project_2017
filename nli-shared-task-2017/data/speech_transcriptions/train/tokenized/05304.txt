I think the Lor - of the Rings is the most interesting book I have read .
The first reason is that uh there is a new language in this book uh I am always very interesting in linguistic .
And the second reason is that the author is very exciting and of course it the author uh they are very , uh they describe the human nature very clearly and I think it 's not very uh easy to do that .
So I think the Door of the Ring is the most im - , interesting book I have ever read .
