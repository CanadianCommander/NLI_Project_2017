Well , the most interesting book that I 've ever come across is Freedom at Midnight by Jawaharlal Nehru .
It reflects the uh on the struggle that had been undertaken by the Indian citizens in order to , to get them rid of the struggle .
It also is uh is a book that reflects the plight of the citizens as well as their difficulty and their achievements , their success , their failure .
It goes through a roller-coaster of events right from their struggle , right from their sadness , right from their pity to their happiness as well as the , the happy state of mind in which they breathe in a country where they have finally achieved the boat-ride which is freedom .
