I want to talk about the book , The Da Vinci Code .
I think it 's really interesting because there are a lot of different topics combined in it and you have to find connections throughout the whole book .
There are a lot of riddles and you 're trying to solve them by yourself .
And um the author leads you to a wrong person and then you have think about what could happen next .
And the I think it 's really interesting if you read a book where you have to think while reading it where to , where you have to try to find out um person by yourself and only in the end , it 's clearer .
That 's the reason why I like it so much .
