The kind of reading materials I read the most is probably novels or stories .
It 's because of the , when you read something about other people in different stories you relate to them in different situations and it 's the most entertaining to .
It 's kind of like watching a movie .
You read about other people in other stories in different situations and you can live through their experiences and relate to all the stories they they represent and the experiences that they have .
