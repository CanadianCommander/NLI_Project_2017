Actually I had been away sometime to Canada and I stayed there for a long time and during the time , it was very hard to not missing my home country .
I mostly missed my parents first , then my friends and they were the step overs in my life and without them it as very hard to keep studying .
And also food was very important too and I could n't eat much Korean food there because I was in home stay and eating Korean expensive outside was quite expensive .
So I really have to go back to Korea at the ti - at the moment but now I think well , I did very well to just keep on doing it .
