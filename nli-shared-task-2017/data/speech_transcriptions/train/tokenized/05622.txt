Uh one of the interesting books that I have read is uh Harry Potter .
I like this book because uh , I think the author J. K. Rowling has presented the characters in a very interesting manner .
Uh she has portrayed the evil characters and the good characters in a uh , in a very distinct form do that uh you can quietly distinguish .
And it shows that in the end uh , the good prevails all the evil .
Uh she has also presented some ideas is which I find amazing and uh quite interesting uh especially regarding the critic match and flying on brooms concept .
The girl I think uh she has um presented the story uh in a very well connected .
The , the plot turns out quite well .
