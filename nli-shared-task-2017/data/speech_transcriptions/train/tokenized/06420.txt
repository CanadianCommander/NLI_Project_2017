If friends from another country wanted to come to my country I would certainly tell them to to visit Rome um because it 's a place full of history and art and uh and in fact actually there are lots of tourist who visit Rome every year .
And uh I would also tell them , tell them to go to Venice because it 's a wonderful city that 's just amazing .
Um and uh it 's very picturesque also .
And then uh I would tell them to to visit my small town just because it 's very beautiful small town .
I think it 's really special it 's near the sea and uh it 's really nice .
