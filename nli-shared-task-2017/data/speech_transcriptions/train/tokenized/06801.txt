Uh recently I read the book uh that named Minimized Programs written by in Noam Chomsky in nineteen eighty five .
And the book was impressed me .
Uh the reason is because the gi - the book gives us the the the basic information about language and how language is evolved or um um structures .
In fact the language has many the the his main idea is that language is uniform and uh that was very interesting for me because you know Japanese and Eng - English is so different but uh he says it it 's the same .
