To be a valuable member of a team to me it is important to um fit in the team and um do n't listen to your own um wishes and everything you think is right but uh see the whole team as what you 're trying to to achieve gaols for .
So for example if you 're a soccer team and you 're the best um forward player you should n't just like be fixed on that you should do what the coach says and if you also you should play defense too that 's better for the team like um just give your best for everyone .
