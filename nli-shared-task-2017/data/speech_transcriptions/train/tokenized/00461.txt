The most thing I miss from the home when I 'm away is all my people , my parents my friend and familiar environment around me .
And um but it 's really fun to be away for a while and experience new things too .
But most of all I always miss my parents and my friends and the place I always go to movies and chi - and relaxing and everything .
Um .
