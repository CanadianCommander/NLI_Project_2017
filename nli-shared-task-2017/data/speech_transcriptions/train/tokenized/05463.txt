In case I had some friends uh going to spend some time uh in my country , I would de - definitely uh definitely uh suggest uh they should visit Valencia .
uh Valencia is a city in the East Coast of Spain and uh has a beach and a really nice beach , by the way .
And uh also uh recently uh a really big uh museum has been constructed .
And of course we like Spain have a lot of and nice people to spend time with .
And uh finally uh there is a lovely food uh here to enjoy .
Uh that those would be more my my main reasons uh and uh for for uh suggesting Valencia to spend time in .
