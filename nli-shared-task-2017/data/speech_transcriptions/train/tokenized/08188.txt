I miss my family member , their love , care and concern for me when I 'm away from them .
I also miss the comfort of my home because I am familiar with the surroundings and I 'm and my belongings .
Uh uh I have been away from home for very short uh periods of time and for very less opportuni - uh for very less opportunities but I I think I will miss the most my uh mother 's uh care and love , my father 's guidance , my brother 's uh concern for me and my grandfather 's love and care when I am away from home .
