Well on my free time uh I like to read novels because I think those kinds of books are really interesting and you can um have a nice time and without thinking of your real life .
Uh I also like to read the newspaper because there I can uh have some real notice about everything that 's going on in the world and in my country .
Poetry I like uh not very much but I read sometimes poetry uh Latin poetry because I think it 's uh a mirror of uh of our social and cultural uh roots .
Uh I like to read my magazines just on uh free time .
