An interesting book I have read um is the one called To Kill a Mockingbird .
I thought the book , this book was very interesting because it had racial conflicts in society and it was about this lawyer who despite um uh despite society 's prejudice against black people , he was able to defend a black person for a crime that he did n't really do .
Um did n't really make um the black person free < % > .
