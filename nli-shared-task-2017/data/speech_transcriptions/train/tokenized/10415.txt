I read very interesting book about the story , a biography about the woman who migrate to South Africa .
Um actually she was born there and then moved again back to Germany and then with the age of twenty five again back to South Africa .
It was very interesting for me because she had a lot of troubles at the beginning there and then also with the different cultures , she had a lot of problems and then with the because for me it was interesting because I was there also in South Africa .
