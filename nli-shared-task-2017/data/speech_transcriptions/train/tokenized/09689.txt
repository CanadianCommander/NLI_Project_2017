First of all , I really miss um my relationship with my family and especially with my mother .
Uh then I miss also my home and my room and all my countryside .
For instance , I am now in Paris and I really miss my mother uh and who is living in Pau in the South France .
That 's why I call her every day and I I need to share with her all my life here in Paris and to share my experiences and what I need , what I feel during all this trip in Paris and I miss al - also my father in Israel .
