I like to read a book called first year of the life , which conveys a lot of information for the first time mother .
For example it give you all this schedule of the ministration that the baby will need .
It also informed informed informed mother what kind of reactions they could expect whenever they receive the shots .
Also it give you the explanation how to take care of the baby so shows when you have to bath the baby , after how many days after the baby was born , how to take care the the umbilical cord ?
How often do you have to take her to see the doctor ?
