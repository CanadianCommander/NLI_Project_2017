The most efficient type of transpo - transportation in my country would be public transport , public transportation particularly train system .
Um it is efficient because it is in most cases on time punctual and then it we have um very clean sub - subway and train systems .
And you know whenever there is delay the there are reasons where the announcements are made and it is quite different from what we have in some places in United States or you do n't have the timetable or the you just do n't know when the train is coming .
