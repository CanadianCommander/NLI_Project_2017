I live in now but I my , my , my hometown is Istanbul and I 'm away from my home town .
Uh actually when I 'm away from my home uh the things that I uh most miss is my family , because I love my parents hence when I 'm not with them I feel stressed .
Also I miss my home and my friends too because I do n't like being alone .
Uh I need some people around me that 's why I do n't like being away from my hometown .
