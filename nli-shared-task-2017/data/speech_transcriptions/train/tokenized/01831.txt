If I could have any job or I I wanted , I would like to be an English teacher in my country where in Japan because there are so many Japanese student from junior high school or high school .
I try to learn English , however I think there 's no good teacher because teacher has not have a experienced very wel - very so many times .
So that 's why things uh uh I have been studying in Canada .
I think I 'll be able to to have better experience to teach English in Japan .
So that 's why I would love to be a teacher .
