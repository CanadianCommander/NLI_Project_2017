The most import opportunity that I had was um the chance to go to the U.S for an entire semester at the university of Texas at Austin .
Uh there are many three reasons why I think this is the best opportunity I had , first it was my first international experience , second it was a good opportunity where I could attended any course at the department of economics and at school of business .
And last but not lea - and last but not least it was uh , Austin was a real cosmopolitan town where I could meet new people , fantastic people that remain very good friends .
