Often I want to read about literature and common news .
The literature for instance I read about Henry Thoreau , the topic is War Den .
This book helps me to understand the true nature in this world , and how the nature is destroyed like day by day .
It helps me to reflect on how I should protect the nature .
Also I want to read the news because reading uh this kind of news helps me to increase my common sense over the world , because the current world is very important .
Such as the nuclear war in Australia .
