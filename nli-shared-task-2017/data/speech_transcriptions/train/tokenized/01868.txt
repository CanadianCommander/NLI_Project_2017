If my friend from another country were going to the and spend time in my country I would suggest him to go to Jerry Mountain with me .
The mount - uh I would suggest the mountain because it has very beautiful scenery that can be fou - that can not be found in anywhere else and I I would suggest him to go to Jerry Mountain because of because um on Jerry Mountain there are many Korean traditional restaurants uh which provide um Korean food and uh which my friend can enjoy and this is why I suggest him to go to Jerry Mountain with me .
