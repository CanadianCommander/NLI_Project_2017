When I 'm away and at home I miss my family members the most .
I miss my family members because they are always um with me and they always care for me .
Um and they are always there for me when I need com - comfort .
Um and secondly I miss the atmosphere at my home because it 's always noisy and pleasant and there 's always laughter around .
I also miss the caring and the love that my parents and my sisters give to me when I 'm at home .
That 's all .
