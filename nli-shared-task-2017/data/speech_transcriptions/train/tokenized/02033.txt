When I am away from home , most of the time I do n't miss a lot , I do miss my friends .
Um a lot of times my friends come to my home , and we hang out and watch TV , since I have an apartment for myself .
Um I would miss my mom I live with her , and I will miss my bed and my privacy , my room and my computer .
But I do n't really miss much when I 'm away from home , since I like to experience new things and meet new people .
