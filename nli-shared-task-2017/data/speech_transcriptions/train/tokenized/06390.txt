It 's it 's special because uh it gives great opportunity for great future especially for me that uh I come from a family that has always slept early and um I always slept early so it helps me because I think it will help me because it will give me a wider view on the world um bigger experience , a better experience .
I 'll get to know more things , new things that I can not know and I can not see staying here .
And uh also because I think uh going to the United States , that is .
