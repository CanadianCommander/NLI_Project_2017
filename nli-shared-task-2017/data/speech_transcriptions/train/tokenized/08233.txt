A special opportunity that was given to me was uh , uh that uh I got the chance to go to the United States the summer for four weeks .
I was in Miami and uh international language school and uh yeah I think uh there I improved my English a little bit and uh yeah it was a great time .
Uh could repair , can prepare uh for the tough test today and uh I met a lot of new friends from all over the world .
So it was really great to uh to uh learn something about other cultures and other languages .
Yeah that 's it .
