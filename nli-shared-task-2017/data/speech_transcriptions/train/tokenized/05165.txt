Being in the income is important factor when choosing a job .
First of all , job is a place where I can earn money .
Everyone needs uh wants such a much money .
First , I think the more money I get from work the better a job is .
In addition uh with a lot of money I can do many things such as traveling , shopping or sending gifts to my parents or .
Uh for example last month I got a bonus from my job , so that I could go and a trip to Europe with my family .
If we were never with the money I would not traveled abroad and had a good time with my families .
So therefore for this reason I think money is very important at work .
