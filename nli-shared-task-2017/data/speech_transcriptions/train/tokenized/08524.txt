I miss my family the most when I 'm out from my town or from my home since I 'm staying with my family .
And we 're a joint family we 're staying all of us , my uncles and aunts and everyone , so it is a very very big family .
And when I 'm out from my home I really miss them because I do n't find their company with me .
And even if I have to make the kind of decision also I can not , I can not made any kind of decision without the presence or without the uh without their presence .
So I really miss them drastically , also I miss the environment what I get in may home with you can not get outside , I miss my house .
