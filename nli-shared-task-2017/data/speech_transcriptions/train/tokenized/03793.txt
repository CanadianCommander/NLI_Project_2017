One very interesting book I read was How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie .
The book actually instructed me on the signs of human relations .
It taught me how and why people react the way they actually do .
After completing this book I got a totally new insight into how to deal with people and how to maintain the relationships with them .
For example , I came to know that mentioning a person 's name to them during a conversation is extremely important to build a rapport .
Also , the book taught me very valuable lessons on how to influence people .
It also taught me very very valuable leadership skills .
This is one of the most interesting books that I have ever come across .
