Yeah if your if friends from other country come , come , come to my place I would suggest them to visit Pon - Pondicherry .
Because Pondicherry is a multi culture ci - city where you can find lot of Indian infotainment means lot of useful information along with entertainment .
Means if , you can the greatness of the French culture it it had and wonder about the Indian information about their way of life their different cuisine and what are how their education system will be and how the , the , the administration will be .
And that thing is to know about the culture the and main thing is it 's very near to the Chennai airport .
So I think Pondicherry is best .
