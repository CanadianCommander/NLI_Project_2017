I miss more stuff about my home uh when I , when I am away is my pa - are , are my parents .
My pa - because they are always stand behind me when I , when I got depressed .
Uh I remember I got in trouble uh when I am away in university , and my parents telephone me everyday .
That makes me miss them , that makes me miss them even , even much .
So I think I miss most of about my parents when I am away .
