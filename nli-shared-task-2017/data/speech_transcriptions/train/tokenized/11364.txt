The special opportunity that was given to me is to work as a pharmacist intern in in New York in Manhattan .
It was very important to me because it helped me a lot in my exam as a foreign pharmacist to be a pharmacist here in United States .
It gave me a lot of experience , it gave me a self-confidence and it gave me a lot of information about different medicine in United States .
