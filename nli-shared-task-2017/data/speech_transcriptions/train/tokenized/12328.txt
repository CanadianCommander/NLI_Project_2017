One of the accomplishments that I 'm really I 'm very proud of and I had to work very hard for it was to get into the IIT which is the Indian Institute of Technologies in India .
They have a joint entrance examination which is conducted all over the country .
I cleared this exam in two thousand and two .
It is a very difficulty exam to get into since only two percent of the students who appear for the exam actually make it to the institutes .
It is it was very important for me to clear such an exam because uh I needed to get into the top technical institution of India and achieve my purpose .
So I think this is a very important accomplishment for me and it was .
