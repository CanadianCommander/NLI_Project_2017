It was can be very interesting to read this book as it uh as this professor um outlined what was for him uh in a very simple way and for everyday life what was for him uh the the biggest um um the biggest challenges of tomorrow and I really , uh after having read this book I really uh changed the way of uh um of living really in everyday life .
For for example of caring about uh what uh materials that I was buying and packages and and trying to buy to .
