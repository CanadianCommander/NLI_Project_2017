The special opportunity that I was given was to serve as a volunteer at the ho - hospital .
The reason why I think this is important because I counsel the people , I mean the patients in the hospital .
This way I can understand the people and I ca - I can also serve better and this way I can improve and support hospital in the needs and also in the facilities .
This way I can gain knowledge .
