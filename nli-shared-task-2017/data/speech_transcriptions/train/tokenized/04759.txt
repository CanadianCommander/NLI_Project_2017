I study English at the University of Pittsburgh and uh I have to read a lot of books for my tuition platform .
Uh a book I found very interesting was Great Gatsby cause I think it describes very good side here of America and in the twenties and first of all the American decline , uh the decline of the American uh is very good described in there and uh I like to see the philosophy of the American uh society and it was quite interesting and there was also uh a conflict in it and uh a criminality .
