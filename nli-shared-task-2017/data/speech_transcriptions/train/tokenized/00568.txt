First of all , I would suggest um going to Berlin because um it 's the capital of Germany plus uh there are lots of things to see , lots of uh museums because uh it 's a very um uh lots of important um things in history have happened in Berlin .
So uh yeah like I said there are a lot museums and also uh um other things you can do .
Other than that , I would um suggest going to see the castle at because it can be seen a lot of wonders uh plus I would show them uh the town where I will live in .
