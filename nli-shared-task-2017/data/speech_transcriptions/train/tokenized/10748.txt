The book I read was The Da Vinci Code .
It was exciting uh from the first page to the last page uh to the last one .
I found it exciting because I love uh I love arts and and main and beginning uh the book start in and it was really amazing because I 've been so many times there and I just uh I was amazed that there a drama a dramatic , there was a killing in the first seconds and there was a a plot .
The plot was was about the church and and it was really exciting .
