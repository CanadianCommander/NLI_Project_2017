If uh friends from other country were going to spend time in my country I would suggest that he should visit Delhi because it 's the capital of my country .
Because because it is having the sun temperature it uh it contains an history of it 's own kind and uh because it 's , is a city obviously where I live .
So it means a lot to me when my friends come from , from another country comes to see me I , I do want him to see where I , you know how where I live .
Rajasthan is one of the beautiful places on earth I believe so it 's one of the greatest heri - heritage of India , Punja - Punjab it 's because of the uh golden temple , that 's all .
