The accomplishment that I worked hard was the entrance examination for my university .
It was very hard for me to prepare and to study for everything and it took me a very long time .
Why it was very important to me was that I wanted to um study international relations at my university and I really wanted to enter this university to prepare and study for my future .
So um preparing for this entrance examination was what required me to work very hard .
