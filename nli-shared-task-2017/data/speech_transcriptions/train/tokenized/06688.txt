Um very important uh uh accomplishment important to me was my exhibition in my school art um exhibition .
Was for the the IDVA the International Visual Arts .
And was very hard to me because I was only attended the class for one session .
And for the rest of the time because of schedule changes I did n't have the class so I had to work on everything on my own in my free time .
And it was very important to me because I love art , and I want to become an artist and my concept was that teacher was very pleased with my exhibition especially because I did n't have enough time .
I did n't have class time to work on the pieces I only have my free time at home , my free time .
