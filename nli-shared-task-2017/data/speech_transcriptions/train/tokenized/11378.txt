A visit from friends from another country is very exciting thing .
Actually , I already uh I had such a situation when some friends of mine came over from Canada and I brought and showed them my home city with all the big things like the really old uh in our town , some bars .
and I think it 's very important to get a feeling of what it what it means to live like and very beautiful , old city .
Something they did n't experience because current cities are really young .
