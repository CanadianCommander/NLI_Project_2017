Really enjoy the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown .
It conveys uh fiction and real uh real life through works of the Da Vinci and many works of art .
Uh it 's a suspense story , it 's a thriller and I really enjoyed it because it really mixes um fiction with real life by coding and um giving examples of works of art by Da Vinci and some other famous painters .
Uh I think it 's a very good book and it was well written and although it is a little bit far fetched , I really enjoyed the fiction part .
