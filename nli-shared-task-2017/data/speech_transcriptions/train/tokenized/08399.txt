If I could have any job or a career I wanted , I would probably choose to be a doctor .
Uh the reason for this is because uh I 'm currently a part of the First Aid Squad in Summit the city where I live .
Uh currently I 'm in uh emergency medical technician which means that uh I work every Monday night from uh seven PM to eleven PM and my job is pretty much to just sit in the back of the ambulance and uh help out the patient , try to improve their condition , um see anyway I can help them out and uh this is probably why I would like to join uh some college related
