I read a quite interesting book um some years ago , it is called The Body by Stephen King .
And I really liked it .
Um basically it 's about four young boys living in a small town in the US .
And one Saturday they go out to find a dead body .
And it is really interesting because it describes um the relationship of the four different boys who have different um background .
And is very talented in writing and his dream is to become a writer but he .
