I like reading novels .
Um it 's because um it 's um more of a lot of detective stories and it interests a lot to , a lot of it it 's it 's it 's um my pass - if the passage of time is really good and sometimes uh sometimes really it really make make up , make up other um free time uh you get and the way which the the novels are explaining like the Hardy Boys like like Article Nine , there 's Sherlock Holmes .
We have good experience as what they are going on .
And it kind of leads their life .
