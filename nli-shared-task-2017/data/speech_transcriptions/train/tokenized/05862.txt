I miss the most about my grandparents about my home , because my grandparents uh grow , growing me up .
And they cook a very delicious food for me everyday and when I have some problem I always asking about them because they have a lot of , a lot of experience .
And they are very kind to ailing people or so I learned how to get on with people from them .
