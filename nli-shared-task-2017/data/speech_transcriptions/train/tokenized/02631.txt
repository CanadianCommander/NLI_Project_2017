One thing that I miss the most from my home when I 'm away is my family , especially my mom .
I miss the warmth of people around the way they played and the kind of uh wrong that we would share .
Another thing that I miss is homemade food which uh I entirely enjoy and I would prefer any day to the food I eat outside .
I also miss uh my friends around uh my locality and place I grew up in .
So this is what I missed the most .
My family , the food , the people and uh my own room which I miss the most , place that I grew up .
That 's it .
