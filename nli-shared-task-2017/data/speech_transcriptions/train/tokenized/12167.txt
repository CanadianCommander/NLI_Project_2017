If I could have any job or a career I wanted I would like to take dental technol - dental technician .
Uh there are two reasons for that .
Now I 'm studying in Canada , so uh if I if I be a dental technician I can find a job very easily because I heard in north America there are lack of dental technical and second of all dental technician is the dental technician makes good money I heard .
And also also if if I if I am be a dental technician for two or three years after that I can have my own lab .
