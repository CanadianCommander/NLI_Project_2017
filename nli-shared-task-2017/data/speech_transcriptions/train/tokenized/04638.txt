I miss most uh , uh I miss most about my co - uh my home 's country , my home is Austin because I live in country side and there are very cars when compared to big cities .
And there has clean airs and friendly people because we live in the countryside where people are more friendly than those in cities .
And we have more , we 've closer relationships and we know each other and we interact very well .
So I will miss most of uh .
