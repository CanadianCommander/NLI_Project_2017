In my view I will take friends to the pyramids .
One of the miracle in the world .
They were build from seven thousand years old and still standing till now .
Anybody when see the pyramids he ask he asks himself , how they built this huge building ?
How they are transported ? .
The huge stones they 're amazing .
You can fill you can take a lot of photos you can enjoy the weather there .
I think it 's an amazing place my tourist will enjoy his time .
