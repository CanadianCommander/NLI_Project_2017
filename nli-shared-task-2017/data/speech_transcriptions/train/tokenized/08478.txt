When I have a free time I like to read look for French literature .
Of course for me it 's a way to do better uh my country uh for the book and the history of my country .
It 's also a way uh to know the evolution of the society , my country and the problem that my country has faced uh during war during uh important period .
It 's also a way to improve my knowledge in literature but of course I also like to read magazine , magazines about uh current events about politics and economy it 's a way to me to be to know .
