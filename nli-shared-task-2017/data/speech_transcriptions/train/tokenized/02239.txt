I 'll sugge - suggest to visit Riyadh the capital of Saudi Arabia because it is uh well organized city , very huge .
It has good traffic rotations , uh boats and uh tracks .
It uh it has also u a lot of markets and places to go .
We have also uh lots of traditions , uh festivals from time to time , sometimes monthly and some time some of them yearly .
So also it has a lot of hotels and apartment .
