Last year I had a big opportunity to demonstrate my skills playing a rugby game .
Um well I happen to play rugby and um and it was one of my first times playing for the first division team in Italy .
And this game was really important because it was against the and championship .
And um so I was new on this team and the coach gave me the chance to play after uh really good week uh for myself .
Uh I did training sessions so I had the big chance and uh it felt good .
It was really important for me I could demonstrate how to play .
