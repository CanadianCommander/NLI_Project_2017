Uh among many uh reading materials such as novels , magazines and poetry , I uh mostly likely to read uh novels in my free time uh because of the following reasons , uh first of all , you can use uh a lot of imagination while you 're reading novels .
Unlike television , the situation is not given and as you read you have to imagine uh the situation and the scenery like such such uh such uh such things .
Uh also uh you can learn from the character in the book .
You can see like how character responds to a certain situation and learn the new way of thinking about certain object or situation .
Um that 's why I read .
