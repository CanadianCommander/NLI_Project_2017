That uh there are two things that I miss uh about home when I 'm away uh it 's mostly uh comfort that I have in my house that I miss .
And when I 'm away like I 'm abroad or something like I already miss that food that my mother prepares me and uh , and we can say that I can also , I , I 'm also using my stuff that I have in my house , uh my guitar , my , my PC uh my certain uh properties et cetera .
And uh most of the time I get homesick when I 'm away because of these things .
