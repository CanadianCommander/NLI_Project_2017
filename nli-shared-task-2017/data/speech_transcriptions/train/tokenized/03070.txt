When I 'm away from home the most thing I will I miss is my family and my friends my friends .
I rely on my family and friends very much and I ca n't imagine a life without them .
It could be some vacations that I take for I say for month and it might be very enjoyable but I think I will miss my family and friends very much .
They 're uh they mean lots to me a lot to me and I ca n't think of life without them .
