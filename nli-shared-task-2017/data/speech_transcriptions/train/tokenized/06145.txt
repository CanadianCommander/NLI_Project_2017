If I could any have any job or a career I wanted , I would like to be a hotelier .
The reason why I say this is because I always dreamed about being a hotelier since I was young , because they look really nice when they are wearing their hotelier uniforms .
And the other reason is I will be able to face a lot of people from different countries , which will probably make me feel happy and enjoyable .
For this reasons I really want to be a hotelier if I can be anything , any job , if I choose any job .
