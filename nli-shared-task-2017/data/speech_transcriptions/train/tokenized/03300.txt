The interesting book uh I 've read is the Science of Vastu um and I found it is interesting because um um it is much related to my profession as an civil engineer and it gives more details about the or about the places , the nature of the place .
Uh for example , the f - uh vent rooms of the house must be faced with north or east which will be suited best .
And even I felt it quite interesting and excited to read because nowadays , all the people are believing in this Vastu and I found this book is very interesting .
