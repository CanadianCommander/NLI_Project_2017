Uh the book I read was great adaptations written at school .
It 's a book we all read together .
Book helps us to know and to care about one another , to care about .
It talks about an orphan and how he struggled and it 's good to to care about people so for for the society to be a better society and for us to be all together and to have peace in the world , you know it starts out in doing small things such as helping orphans and that can help other stuff and bring other things .
And so I really enjoyed reading the book .
