When I was young uh I had a bike injury and so uh normally no one could fix .
But I , I had opportunity that uh I was given to uh operation to fix my knee .
Uh that 's to reason why is it important for me , uh because is uh no one fix my uh before I meet the one guy .
And second is uh , uh I could n't walk before uh moreover I could n't play any sports of course .
Uh but because if I had opportunity uh to fix uh , uh opportunity ha - have opportunity to operation and I fix , uh they fixed my knee and I can walk right now so .
