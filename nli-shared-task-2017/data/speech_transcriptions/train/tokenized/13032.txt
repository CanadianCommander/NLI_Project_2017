What I miss mostly about home is my family and also my room .
My family most because I love them very dearly , especially my mother and father .
My own room I miss absolutely because I can find everything I need to in there .
Um furthermore I think my home is very important for me , because I can stay it 's too good everywhere I want to , especially seeing friends , going to the city I know without having difficulties , and that 's why totally I think my home is very important from me , on the one hand because of my family and on the other hand because of the circumstances that my house is situated .
