What I uh miss most uh about my home when I am away it 's uh my room because I really like to be there .
I can be there alone , I can do my homework and um I can listen also music , play guitar and uh it 's a place where I feel very good .
And it 's a place that I can not have the same when I live in another country because uh my room is not the same and the bed also is not the same like it 's not so comfortable as mine and uh I do n't meet the same friends in my room and I do n't have the same picture in the wall and I prefer to live in my room .
