When uh I am away from my home is uh , it is only people uh who uh miss uh me , who I miss .
Uh my parents miss me because my mother help , helps me a lot doing my washing machine .
The second uh kind of people who uh miss , missed is my brother and my cousin because I do a lot of uh sports with them .
And I like uh to do uh sport .
And when I am not home uh it is uh far more difficult to practice uh football when you are not enough to play .
