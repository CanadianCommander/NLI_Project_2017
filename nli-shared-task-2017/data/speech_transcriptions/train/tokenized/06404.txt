The main thing I miss when I 'm away from home is that food .
The food uh my mother makes is very very good and good for eating but when I go out of my home and when I stay in hostel , the food there is very bad and it 's not good for eating like I ca n't eat uh looking at it .
And because of that I lost weight of around five KGs within a period of three months .
Uh so but I regained my weight back when I 'm back in home .
So I guess the food is the most important thing I miss when I 'm away from home .
