I like the novels because it 's more about the real life and when I read the novels I can find I can find parts from my own life and to even events are going on the novels are the same with events that are going on around me .
And I like the language that used in the novels and it 's also from the daily life .
And it makes the novel more real when you start to real then you start to read and real every event you 're you get more enjoy from it .
That 's why I like novels .
