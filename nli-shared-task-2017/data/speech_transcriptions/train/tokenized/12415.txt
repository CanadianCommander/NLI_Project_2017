I 've been asked to speak about what I miss more when I 'm away from home and the thing that I miss more is food .
Uh because in Spain is quite different to other countries and I really like the Spanish food as per here and also is like uh is to sleep properly because out of home , I do n't do it .
At home I have a really nice bed .
Other thing is my mom that I really miss her when I I 'm uh far away from home uh like uh when I have a good meal in the table and things are the things that I miss more when I 'm away from home .
