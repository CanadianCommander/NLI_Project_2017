An in - interesting book that I read is Laws of Life .
It is very interesting book because it talks about the slavery versus uh the order in uh in civilization .
Uh uh the author uh uh William Golding exposes uh this topic uh by using uh uh children left alone in an Island and uh uh and they struggle between favoritism and democracy .
