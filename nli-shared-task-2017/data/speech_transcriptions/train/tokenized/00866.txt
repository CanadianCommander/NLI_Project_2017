Since my childhood I 've been interested in airplanes because my dad was an airplane pilot .
So part of the books that I read are related to airplanes .
Mostly novels and uh some mere things about the why those things fly and why how the pilots control them .
I do not like much poetry because I 'm , my school it has been most mostly practical and um I 'm right now majoring in an engineering which is practical .
So unlike much poetry there are .
