Opportunity that was very important to me was the opportunity to sing in a rock band because I had the opportunity to perform in front of an audience and to gain confidence in myself .
And the ability to , I had written for a long time and to be able to communicate my writing in a way that more people could uh appreciate it was very important to me .
Not only that but it helped me uh deal with situations that I could normally ca n't address while speaking for example hard situations that I see every day .
For example , crime and corruption , things that are hard to talk about it 's much easier to sing about them for example heartbreak and everyday things .
It was a great opportunity .
