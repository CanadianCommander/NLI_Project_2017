I suggest they visit Atakule , Atakule is a place in Ankara .
Atakule is sky scrapper .
When you go at the top of the Atakule we take small price uh five Turkish dollars uh about three dollars you can see all Ankara .
It has magnificent view , you smell the breath you smell the fresh air and then relax .
And there is more opportunities in Atakule , there is shopping centres and very good place and you can test different of Ankara traditional foods .
