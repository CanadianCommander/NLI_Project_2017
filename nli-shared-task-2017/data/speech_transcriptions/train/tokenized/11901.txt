One of the pre - one of the special opportunity that was given to me was the presentation in my physics class .
Uh I was very nervous about presentations it was the first time to have a presentation in English .
And also there were many professors coming to see the talks .
But it was a really good experience to talk in English , very not um and and it made me have a confidence about talking in English and have a presentation on important subject .
