I like novels most , I like novels more than magazines or poetry and I like them more than the others because um novels are interesting for me .
So I can see the story of the persons and the story develops itself and goes on and on .
And in magazines we see pictures and stuff like that .
And poetry is n't even my types because poetry is too poetic and I it 's I just do n't like it .
So I think novels are the best .
