The most important thing I miss when away from home is the love I uh , I get from my parents and my brother .
Because that love I ca n't get from my friends or anybody else with whom I miss uh the , in my college or in um , if I 'll working and whatever .
The secondly , the second thing I miss is the uh homemade food which I love very much .
The I eat all the food uh prepared by my mum .
It like the love as well .
So I feel that for any person in the world to survive , love uh from anybody whom they love equally is uh worth more than just some other thing .
Uh in the , in the , in the virtue of some .
