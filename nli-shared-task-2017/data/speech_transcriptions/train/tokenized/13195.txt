The opportunity I had once , well actually three times has been to be the Run Coordinator of my experiment during the data taking period .
This has been a really a great period because of higher responsibility because I had to talk with the accelerator uh experts and my experiment expert and it was really exciting uh and a very good , good time to take uh good data of good quality .
At the same time I was also the expert of a part of the detector and that also was quite exciting to be both uh , to cover both roles .
I mean being both coordinator of the data taking and the expert of the detector .
It has really been a great time and uh moreover , you need a lot of people in the control room .
