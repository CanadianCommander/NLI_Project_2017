A few years ago when I was a member of uh one of the social groups for youths , I was given an opportunity to talk on behalf of my group uh more of my city and mo - moreover uh in for my country I gave a presentation about what are we doing here and what are our plans to do and I gave a brief exa - uh information about Turkey also .
That was a great opportunity and by this opportunity I managed myself , I learnt to talk in front of a huge uh crowded uh before the opportunity I would be afraid of that so I name this opportunity it was the biggest one for me .
