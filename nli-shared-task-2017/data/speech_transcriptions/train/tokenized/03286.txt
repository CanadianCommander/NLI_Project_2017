When I 'm away from my home I mostly miss my nephew , because he is just four years kid and I just love playing with him .
I miss his smile his naughty efforts to irritate me , I miss him badly .
And most importantly I miss my mother , I love her care for me , she just solve all my problems in no time .
And when I 'm out I have to do all my wok on my own .
Secondly I miss the peace and that warmth of my family especially my parents and also my nearby friend I miss a lot because she is my childhood friend .
