After uh completing my school , I had decided to pursue engineering as a profession .
For this I had to prepare for an exam , entrance examination to one of the most prestigious institutes of my country .
This ins - entrance exam is considered to be extremely difficult .
Lots of students apply and only a thousand get selected .
For this I had to go through a disciplined and sincere uh preparation .
I had to sacrifice a lot of pleasures which my friends enjoyed .
But after years of hard work I finally achieved the result and it gave me a lot of satisfaction and it left me more de - disciplined and focused for life .
