Uh the opportunity I was given uh that was important was to come to the US um to go to school and to learn a new language .
Um it was good for me because I met people from all over the world and I got to make new friends and um I learned about their cultures and um I 'm from West Africa and we do n't have that diversity back home .
So it was really interesting for me to come in the to the US and um meet people and um know about the world because this country is melting part and it 's a great opportunity to go to school here .
