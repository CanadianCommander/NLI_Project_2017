I recently began reading a book about macroeconomics and it uh seems really interesting to me .
It 's quite related to my studies but uh now I have the whole picture of the economy by reading this book about the macroeconomics .
Uh the book solves the connections between different countries uh and the foreign exchange markets so now you can connect things you know , uh in the small , you can uh , you can get these connections uh in uh , on the whole world and you 'll see the , the big picture .
