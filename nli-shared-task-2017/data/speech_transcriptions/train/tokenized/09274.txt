I like to read newspapers , the daily newspaper in the morning and in the evening read specific papers or books from some parts of studies that I 'm not studying currently .
From reading the daily newspapers important to keep up with the daily news , to get the information that are necessary for for developing my future .
And I like to read scientific journals or papers because I 'm very interested in the science and you ca n't study all the things at the same time .
So you can have some spare time looking at what other subjects is going on .
