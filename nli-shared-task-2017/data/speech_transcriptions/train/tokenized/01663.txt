After my secondary , in university in Physics Department uh I got a chance uh to go to Princeton University um for internship .
I think uh it it was a special opportunity and very uh significant o - opportunity for me uh because I 'm a physicist and I want to uh do my do uh PhD on atomic physics and Princeton university is the best university in , in that area .
So um this chance uh this chance uh will uh will be very helpful uh for admissions I guess .
