I probably uh miss my computer and my Internet connection .
That 's because uh in the years I 've become almost dependent on it because I like spending time in front of the comp .
And when I 'm away I ca n't uh connect the Internet or I ca n't surf on Internet .
I can do on Internet cafes , but uh it 's not the same thing .
I think it 's much easier and much uh , um comfortable for me in front of my computer .
So uh when I 'm away , I normally get bored .
I just want to be home and can , be on my computer and Internet because I really like my computer .
