Well , I have n't had time to read an interesting book for a long time because of uh uh the work hard at university but uh incidentally the last book I read was very interesting .
It 's titled the uh Infinite War , I think .
It 's rather , I know it 's a rather marshal topic for a book but it 's actually just science fiction and at that really good science fiction I might say .
Uh the thing is what it difference , uh what 's the difference between this book and usual science , uh usually when you think about science fiction is that it 's an really really sick uh uh wha - what do you say , setting .
It 's probably describes the the human time about thousand years uh so .
