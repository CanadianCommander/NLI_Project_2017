It was an opportunity for me to leave my home in Hong Kong and move to the United States to be a consultant for a biotechnology company .
I used to run a company in Hong Kong selling Bio-tech products and through the contest in America I was invited to go there to be a consultant .
And there I can get uh to know more about American culture and working condition and also to give me an opportunity to return to University and to have further study in business .
And this opportunity also give me time to get to know many American friends there , and to start a new life .
