I like reading novels because it grows my imagination and makes me experience what I ca n't for example when I read Tom Sawyer 's adventures I can uh adventure with them .
I can go and it grows my imagination like for example it gives me descriptions of Martians and other planets in science fictions .
So I think it is good for me to experience that I ca n't and sit still and read novel and experience many things .
I think it 's why I like reading novels .
