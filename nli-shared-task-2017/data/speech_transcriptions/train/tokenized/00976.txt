So I have two kind of reading materials I really like to ha - to read .
First it 's poetry because I think that poetry is the most relaxing thing that there is .
Uh you can free your mind while listening to , while reading poetry but what I like the most is scenarios because when working in the movie business so I have to study scenarios and it motivates me in a way too look at grand scenarios who normally received Oscar or s - or something like that and think that maybe one day I can write one of those , So it it 's something that really motivates me and that makes , that reminds me what I want to do .
