I think this special opportunity I had it was come to this country .
Um I was really lucky because my parents supported me since the first moment I decided to go out of my country .
And um the way I came here was , was as an um you know I take care of kids , I go to school , I do some other stuff .
Um and I 'm really glad that I did this because it 's , I think it 's the perfect time in my life .
I think it is um um the best opportunity and the best thing I 've done ever because I met a lot of people that I know are my friends for life and I opened my perspective of the world and the uh United States .
