The most interesting book I have read is about a book called Tuesday with Morrie written by uh Mitch Albom .
And I I 'll chose this book for some reason .
For the first reason is that uh the main idea of this book and is about once you you learn uh how to take sorry once you know what days what death is and you you know how to you know how to live .
And the topic is very easy but it hardly hardly took practice in real life .
And the second one is is talk about uh the relationship with families and some like death or marriage and .
