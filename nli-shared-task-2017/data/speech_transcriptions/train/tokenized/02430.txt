I was given the opportunity to attend Boston University for a Summer course during uh two thousand and six .
And I really enjoyed the campus it was nice .
I did some uh courses in mathematics , uh calculus and uh another course in physics , uh Principles of Physics .
Uh it was really a nice experience as I uh experience the real uh life of life of college .
And uh , uh took a part of uh some research and interesting uh activities in the university .
It 's really interesting to live uh this life before uh it 's the time to .
