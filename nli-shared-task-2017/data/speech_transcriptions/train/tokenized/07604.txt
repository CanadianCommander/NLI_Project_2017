Interesting book I read uh in the last month is a book about spin selling which is to improve our sales approach when dealing with customers .
The uh good point of this book is that the book was written by the the very original author of this method and they gave uh a full overview on this methods explaining how uh come to this conclusions .
He gave such practical examples so that he was able to put it in a application in my professional activity .
And there was able to have uh direct uh results for this from this books so it is why I uh really felt this book as interesting .
