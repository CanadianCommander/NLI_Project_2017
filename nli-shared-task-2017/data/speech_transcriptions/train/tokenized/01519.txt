Sportsmanship is a valuable quality I think which makes someone uh , uh important member of a team , because if a person is not devoted to his or her game , then it will not be possible for him or her to gain success in that particular game .
Moreover , sportsmanship deals with the proper adjustment in the team and with the proper behavior with a team member .
Like is a person is not uh up to the behavior with the team mates , then it will be very difficult for him to adjust in the team and to achieve the goal uh which he or she wants .
