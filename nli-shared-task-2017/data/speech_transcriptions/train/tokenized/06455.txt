When I I what I miss most is my the the company of my friends which I which I love them a lot and they are really important in my daily life .
Uh another thing I really miss is my my mom 's food because she cooks really well and I know I do n't have the opportunity to to such a uh good food when I 'm away even if I go to a good restaurant and another thing I really miss is is my my routine of uh going to the gym or going to my to my classes because I I do n't really like to to go .
