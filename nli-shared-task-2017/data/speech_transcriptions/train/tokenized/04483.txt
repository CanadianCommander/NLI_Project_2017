I 've been uh away from home since for ten years and therefore I miss to miss my family and more than my family , I miss the comfort of my house .
By comfort I mean that my bed at home uh is always the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on .
I have no chance to wash wash my dishes or do my cleaning as as good as at home especially my dirty clothes are best washed at home but it 's other places , I may have difficulties washing them or I 'm and I 'm somehow inexperienced still in some issues .
Therefore I need home .
