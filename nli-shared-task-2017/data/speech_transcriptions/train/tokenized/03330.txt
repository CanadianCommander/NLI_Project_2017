Yeah , the interesting book uh I have read was on international arbitration .
It was interesting because it 's an issue that none of the lawyers or none of the law uh had had res - , uh observed closely .
It was , it was on arbitration in institutions and whether the the place of arbitration rules apply to the uh arbitration proceedings after arbitration .
Uh I learn that arbitration applies to the uh proceedings of arbitration procedures and uh and its status affect me .
