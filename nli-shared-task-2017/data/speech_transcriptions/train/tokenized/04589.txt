If I were given a cho - choice and go selecting among the job or a career I would definitely go for a job because um I 've got so many responsibilities of my family because since my childhood , it 's been my parents so working a lot to make all our sisters study and get well to this stage and now , I feel it is the right time for me to uh to take up those responsibilities as uh as time goes on , the parents will be getting older and it upon you to to take care of them .
And apart from this , by doing job , I can I can at least own some money and settle at my career and and later go on to uh job which I want to .
