I think the most uh valuable uh quality of a person is compatibility .
The compatibility is a main factor which decides a person 's nature and also uh the characteristics of that person , how he takes a , a me - , a member of al - , all members of a team along with himself .
Basically , uh compatibility also refers to how he adjust himself to a person who is lower than his , his own and a person who is at upper level than himself .
So I think compatibility is the most effective and valuable quality a person should have when he 's working in a group .
