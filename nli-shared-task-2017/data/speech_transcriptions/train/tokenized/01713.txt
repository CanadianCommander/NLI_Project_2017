When I 'm away from home uh the things that I miss most are first of all my family um because I I really love them a lot and it 's hard to be away from especially since my grandmother is uh eighty five years old , um I kind of worry about being so far away and not being able to see her as often as I would like .
I also miss my friends uh and because I 'm concerned that uh the longer I I live in a foreign country , the more they will forget about me and I 'm afraid that when when I move by one country they will not count on me .
