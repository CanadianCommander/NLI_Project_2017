If my friends come from uh another country to see and to spend sometime in my country uh I would uh probably take them to Istanbul , uh because of uh it 's beautiful historical places such as the Palace which uh actually hosted uh Ottoman Empire for a long time .
And besides the historical places uh I would uh take them to the um magnificent nightlife of Istanbul .
And , and in addition to that I , I will al - also take them uh to good restaurants where they can um enjoy Turkish food .
