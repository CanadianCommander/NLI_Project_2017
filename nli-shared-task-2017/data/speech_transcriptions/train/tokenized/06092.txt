I like to read magazines in my time .
There are three reasons why .
Um first magazines um have more information than novels or poetry .
Information about daily life or po - politics or nature something like that .
And also um it also conveys news um which is relevant to my um major , finance .
And third um magazines um cons - magazines are composed of short stories so I do n't need to hav - I do n't need to invest a lot of time to read one story .
One the other hand novels do n't have that .
