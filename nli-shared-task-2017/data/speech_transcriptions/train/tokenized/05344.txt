The special opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity to go abroad .
If uh I learned many things from opportunity that was given to me , the first thing was the different cultures and second the different languages .
I talk with many people and learn many things , such as different way of thinking Japanese thinks negatively but recent people thinks positively .
