Yeah uh I 'm and uh when I 'm out of my home uh when the reason I 'm away the most things that I miss are my parents and my bike because the parents as I usually I just love to talk uh whenever I 'm home after a hectic day of work , but when I 'm outside I think most probably I 'll miss them the most because I wo n't have anybody outside to whom I can share all my personal thoughts or whatever I 've done at work , and everything .
The only thing that I will miss and that I may miss is my bike because I love riding a lot and whenever I 'm not home most probably I would be out staying somewhere else and I do n't think I could take my bike .
If and the other case uh as as I get really used to my bed and my computer and all my gadgets .
