A book int - interesting book I have read is Wings of Fire written by Abdul Kalam , a president of India .
He draws my attention a lot because actually before he became a president he is a scientist of India .
So he invented a lot in the research side of uh navigation so he , his auto - his uh this is , the book is his autobiography and so it is inspiring to most of the young scientist in s - space like NASA or any other part of the world .
So this book give a lot of scope to all the to become , to learn more lessons from his uh experiences what he has faced throughout his life .
