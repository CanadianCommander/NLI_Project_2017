When I was very small around um eight or nine years old , I was trying to ride a bike and in that process I fell a lot of times , I injured my knee and then I had to learn how to get up again and that , and then later on after a few weeks I learned how to ride a bike successfully .
And that accomplishment was important to me because it made me have courage to try for new things and , and because I learned that like even bikes they can actually help you to uh .
