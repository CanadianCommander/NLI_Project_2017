A special opportunity was given to me in ninety eight and ninety nine , when I was an exchange student and I visited the United S - um States for an entire year as a student .
Um I was given the opportunity to learn English and to speak it fluently when I returned to Germany .
Um it was a good opportunity to get to know the culture , the American culture .
And it was a good opportunity to find out how it is to live on your own and to um take responsibility for uh your own actions .
That was a really really good opportunity .
