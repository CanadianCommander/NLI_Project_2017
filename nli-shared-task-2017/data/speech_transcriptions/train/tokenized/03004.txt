In my perspective , there are several qualities which makes someone valuable uh for a team .
First of all , he has to be participate participative .
Each person in the group in fact , is able to throw uh on his or her unique education experience and size .
Um other reasons is um contribute those to the group , so he can bring up uh varied backgrounds , uh training level and ex - expertise .
So he can uh also help overcome by enabling the group to view things more than one way .
So first of all he has to be participate participative and accept the uh the others point of views uh which is also efficient and the right yeah the best solutions in that particular case .
