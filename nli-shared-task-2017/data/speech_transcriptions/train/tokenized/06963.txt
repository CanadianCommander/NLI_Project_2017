Um the most personal book that I had read , it was the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown .
Um I consider the book very interesting because it reveal a new plot and the new angle towards the very religious beliefs of the Christians .
Um Christian in such have a belief that uh Jesus did not pass on His genes in anyway that he was not married and that He did not have any offspring .
The ideologies and the plot battle long in the story , conflict with this basic idea of the Christianity .
Um it shows that Jesus did have a child in fact .
The whole angle and the all way that this was bought .
