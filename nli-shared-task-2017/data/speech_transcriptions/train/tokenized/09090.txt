I believe one of the important ability of any individual to work in a team is the teamwork .
The teamwork is essentially allows a person to work with the peers or the other team members of the team .
It also allows to for the individual to share his ideas and listen to the ideas from the other people in the team and also present his opinion about any of the any of the issues or the ideas .
So I believe team work is an important aspect for an a member .
