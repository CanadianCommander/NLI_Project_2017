Honesty is a really important quality of a team member and a group member. o you 've got to be honest when you 're talking with your group and you 're doing stuff with your team , because honesty makes the team , do the thing , the right thing in the right time , okay ?
So for example if you 're searching for something and then uh a team member says the truth about where you may find that thing , then that would you help you find it .
And another thing is teamwork .
Without teamwork , you ca n't do anything as a team or a group , so you 're still the , the most important stuff .
