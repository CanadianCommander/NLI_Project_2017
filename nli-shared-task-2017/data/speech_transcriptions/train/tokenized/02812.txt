If I had to choose a book it would be Through the Looking Glass by , written by uh Lewis Carroll because uh this book uh takes place in a wonderful uh land and uh it 's quite uh interesting to uh to to get away off uh the , your ordinary life and I do like it .
And I that uh what 's the thought , what 's uh I liked it in it is that uh uh the book is based on a chess game and I like to play chess so uh you can see a different characters that uh are here to uh to to uh to be uh .
