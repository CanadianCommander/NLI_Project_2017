Um the country where I live it 's Uruguay .
Um if every time I receive friends , I recommend them to visit Punta del Este , this nice place with o - oceanic beaches .
It 's wonderful for every tourist .
Another of the places I would recommend them it 's going to Colonia .
Colonia it 's near the city of Buenos Aires with uh the Rio River Uruguay in the middle , and it 's also very nice because it 's a historical city where they could take pictures and know something more about the history of Uruguay .
These are the both places I would recommend them .
