I was chosen for uh going to Mexico with the Lottery exchange program .
I was very happy to go because uh it was a great opportunity in the fact that I did n't know any Spanish , so I would learn Spanish .
And plus I would be alone uh in uh , in a totally strange country all by myself .
I was definitely I was living with a family over there , but I did n't know them before and I did n't know Spanish before .
And I have to co - go to uh school where Spanish was the main language .
So uh it was a great difficulty in the first round , but in the first place , but it was a great at the end .
And then I now I think it was a great opportunity , but by that time .
