One accomplishment that I was when I was required to work very hard was when I achieved the rank first rank in my semester examinations which was one of my most coveted dreams of all times .
It was also one my dreams of my parents and I was very proud in doing so .
This is - I was proud of it because I had implemented certain concentration building activities as well as master minded them with huge amount of diligence and seriousness to actually achieve my goal .
I had put in at least six hours of concentrated study each day .
This also helped me understand the true nature of hard work and the fruits that it bares on humanity .
