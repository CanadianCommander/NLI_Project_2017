An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was my , my test to go to the Busan International High School .
I chose to go to the school because a better opportunity to for me to go to a better university my future life .
And , also Busan International High School is in the middle of the mountain , so the environment to study there is a lot healthier and more quieter and a lot better than other high schools .
Also Busan International High School is famous for its facilities and it has everything ranging from uh gym to multi - multimedia lab .
So I 'm very glad that I went to the school .
