My country is Peru .
The capital city is Lima .
I would recommend them to basically go to Lima cause there 's a lot of beaches in there .
It 's the weather is very sunny .
our temperature can reach to thirty degrees like now cause < > summer time .
I 'd recommend people to go to another province .
It 's called Cusco .
Um there , they can find much a picture one of the Incus empire .
It 's very exciting to go there cause you will learn a lot about the history of the Incas and how did they use to create the weapons or tools that they needed for the time they used to live in .
