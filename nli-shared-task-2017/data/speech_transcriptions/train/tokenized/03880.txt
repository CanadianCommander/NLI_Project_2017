If some friend were going to spend some time in my country , I would 've told them to go in two specific place .
First , in Paris which is the capital of France and I think very interesting point to go for different reason .
Um um first , because it 's uh historic and uh economic and cultural capital of France .
So there are plenty of things to see ; museum , Cathedral , listening to m - music .
So I think it will be a this is a good point to see friend through Paris .
My second p - uh city will maybe be Biarritz near the Atlantic uh Sea in order to have some contact with the nature of the sea and enjoy a different landscape .
