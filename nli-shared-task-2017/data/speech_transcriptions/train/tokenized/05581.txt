One of my most um interesting book that I 've ever read um is um Forrest Gump .
Uh actually it is the book uh which is uh based on the movie uh Forrest Gump , casting by uh Tom Hanks .
This was interesting is because uh the thing in the movie uh is quite inspiring and I have uh I can be inspired um by the positive attitude or a uh of the main character .
Uh no matter um what obstacles faced by uh him uh during his life .
Uh also it seems Tom Hanks is my favorite um uh favorite actor and there I feel quite interesting in reading a book which uh in the movie cast by him .
