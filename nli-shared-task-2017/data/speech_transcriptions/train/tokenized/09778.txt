Most difficult period of my time I had to work very hard was a period last summer when I was to suppo - when I was supposed to work for the my research work in Bhabha Atomic Research Center in India .
And also I had to prepare for my GRE exam Graduate Reco - Record Examination that is .
It required a lot of hard work and devotion from my side because I supposed to work in the office from ten AM in the morning to seven PM in the evening and after that then I used to come back , I had to start preparing for GRE again .
So like it was pretty difficult for me .
It was the place as such which was uh there there were no relatives of mine with whom I could live and I had to uh I had to completely depend upon the mess business for having food as well and due to my difficult schedule , uh the plan became very difficult for me in that period .
