The special opportunity would w - which was given to me was to go school in Ireland for all the year .
Um it was a special opportunity because I was able to learn about a totally different culture which is indeed very different from German culture and of course to make new friends .
That it should n't be underestimated that learning a new language was an opportunity of very great importance for me .
Due to my stay in Ireland , I was able to improve my oral English very much and that benefits me today .
