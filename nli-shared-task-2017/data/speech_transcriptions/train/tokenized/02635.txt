An accomplishment I want to talk about is my um taking part in the youth workshop in two thousand and two and two thousand and four .
Um that 's a writing competition and I was part of team Germany because I was very successful here in Germany on tournaments and I had to work very hard in the sport to be on the team and on the other side I had to combine it with a successful school education and um you could only be on the team good at school stuff and also if you achieved a great variety of um success in your sport and that was very demanding but in the end I was part of the team and that was really an accomplishment that required me to work hard .
