An interesting book that I have read is called Jane Eyre , we read in school very recently .
Um I liked it because it was about this girl and it related to our time , it does n't matter how much time goes really , topics are still on day today .
Um it covers a variety of topics um starting with love romance to um forgiveness to lonely child and everything .
I love this book and I really like , love to read it again .
