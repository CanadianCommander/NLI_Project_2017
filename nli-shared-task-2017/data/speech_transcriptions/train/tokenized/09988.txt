And um when I 'm a - away I can not see them .
And I think you um get to learn your , your city , and um so it is quite hard to um to be in a different um at a different place , because you the , the everyday life is quite different .
And um yeah I think that um everybody feels this when he is away .
And um I especially miss my family um we had the everyday life with my family , and um my friends and meeting my friends and so .
