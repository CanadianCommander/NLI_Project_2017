I think a quality that make someone a valuable member of a team would be his reliability because I think that a reli - reliable person is um the most important part of a team .
Um if you know that you are surrounded by people you can trust and you can rel - rely on , then it is easier for you to do the things you are asked to do and to do them in a good manner .
So I think that reliability is very important for a team .
