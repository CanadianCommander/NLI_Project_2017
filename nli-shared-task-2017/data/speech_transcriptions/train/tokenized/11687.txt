I would strongly recommend because it is an old and interesting city .
Um it has uh an old history , um the Romans were there you can the balls and uh also churches .
And then it also it has uh important display in the medieval history because uh um the council was there and can visit market place and it also has mysteries like why is there a sculpture on the bridge pointing right to the dome , and there are funny stories to tell about it .
And all of it , and it is a great place just to hang out and also when uh it is night , yeah .
