An accomplishment that is very important to me I think is my English thesis competition .
I once taking took part in an English thesis competition and this was my first time writing an English thesis but it was a very brand new experience for me because I really love reading and this English thesis competition asked us to write a thesis about your favorite book and research and even compare the protagonist in the books .
I think it 's a very interesting accomplishment and I really worked very hard and about a month to prepare for the competition .
And finally I got the first place in the competition which really surprised me a lot .
