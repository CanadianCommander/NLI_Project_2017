Um that I am not around my family everyday , I am not able to spend time with them in an atmosphere which includes theaters and cinemas and going out to dinner and set uh activities .
Um something else which I miss is that I now have to make sure that my chores are done by myself and I can not rely on someone else doing them , for instance cleaning the house and washing the dishes , making sure that my clothes are ironed and everything is prepared for the next day which used to be taken care of before and of course I miss the city and all it 's possibilities that .
