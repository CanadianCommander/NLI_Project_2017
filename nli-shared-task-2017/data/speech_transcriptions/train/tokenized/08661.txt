What I miss most about the home when I 'm away is my cat .
In fact uh one of uh the reason why I um missed my cat a lot is because I 'm used of uh uh waking up and having breakfast uh with my cat .
It gives gives me a lot of uh l - and support uh during the day .
It it always makes me feel like I 'm uh uh never alone .
Um therefore uh that is the thing that I miss the most uh while I 'm away from home .
