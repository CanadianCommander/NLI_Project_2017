I was given very special opportunity to work in a teaching institute .
That was a very good opportunity for me because I learn a lot about the public speaking and I was very shy in the beginning but I get trained to do the public speaking because I was a teacher .
Then you learn a lot and you have to study a lot that will keep you up to date with uh studying with the knowledge .
So I think that was a very special opportunity given to me .
