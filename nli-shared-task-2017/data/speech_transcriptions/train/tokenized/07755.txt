Uh I would suggest my friends from another country if they could come to Austria to visit Salzburg where I 'm actually uh from and to visit Vienna .
These are the most important cities in Austria what I would say .
They are both , um they both contain famous buildings very old buildings very nice place um many things people were born either in Salzburg or in Vienna or worked here like uh and many other artists and um famous people .
Uh I would also suggest them to , to go to Linz which is very , very nice , very cute little city in Austria .
