I would miss most about home when I 'm away would be the comfort of home , uh the presence of my relatives , my parents and my brother .
Uh the comf - when I say comfort of home I mean uh home cooked food uh home home cooked home cooked food and uh and these other comforts that I do n't receive when I 'm not at home .
Also when and it 's easy to uh talk and share and have emotions with your friends .
