Well actually a very , very g - great opportunity I received is the opportunity of being able to go to the university .
It 's an opportunity which of course I received from my parents but I 'm very happy about it and I 'm honored of being able to do it especially to a private university like is the one that I am attending in Italy .
Let 's say that uh the course uh very important to me and it 's going to uh open a lot of ways and a lot of possibilities for my life more in general .
It 's of course the most greatest opportunity I 've ev - ever received and I 'm glad about it .
