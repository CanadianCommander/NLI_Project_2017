If I could have any dream job I wish I would choose to be a therapist for autistic children and helping then recover from disabilities .
Although I love art , I would be very self satisfied if could help young children overcome their um autism and I I 'm looking forward to going into that during college because they are inspirational to help younger children or even adults with their disabilities which are not fair in life because they were n't , no not everybody else has it either .
