It is very important for a member of a team to have nice manners and to cooperate with the other members .
I believe this , because when you cooperate with others , other like to be with you and enjoy spending time with you .
It is also a good thing to do to cooperate , because when you need help and someone provide for you , then a nice bond is made and people share and become affectionate with each other and the team work becomes more uh efficient and good .
