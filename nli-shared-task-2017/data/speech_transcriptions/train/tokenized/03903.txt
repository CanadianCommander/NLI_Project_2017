Okay , I think um one quality that is very important um um and very valuable for a member of a team is to be um um very attentive and listen to what people have to say because in a team if you do n't listen to the to each other , um you ca n't have a teamwork .
So uh this is something um I would um appreciate very much in uh in team um member .
And also I like uh patience , for me it 's important .
Uh being patient uh when there is more than one people , one person involved .
It 's very important so yeah this is it .
