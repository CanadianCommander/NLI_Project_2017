I think uh valuable member of a team should bring uh the following um abilities .
He should be able uh to tolerate other people 's opinion , he should be polite and friendly in order not to offend other team members .
Uh the member should be able uh to uh deal with compromise , to accept that not his only uh his opinion that 's so uh the most important , and a certain degree of tolerance is important as well .
Because other people may be offensive at times , were their propositions um maybe seems strange .
