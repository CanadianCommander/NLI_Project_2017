An important quality that I think a valuable member of a team should have is of cooperation .
If he 's able to cooperate with other people of the team as well as other people cooperate with him , that person can be a valuable team member .
This is an important quality , because without cooperation , nobody can work in a team .
We all need help of each other to work towards the common goal .
And therefore , it is very important to have a feeling of understanding with each other and ability to help whenever other person is in need to do your own work is also important , but if you can cooperate with others , that is very important .
