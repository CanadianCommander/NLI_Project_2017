About two years ago it was given me the possibility to go in Japan for a couple of month for studying .
And it was a very interesting experience because um I really love Japan um and quite um an expert but just for hobby um when I went there I improved much of my uh Japanese speaking and also my English because in the Japanese school was full of American guys and so the main language was English .
Um when I were in Japan I also stayed uh uh by a family that was very kind um I also presented uh the um older son .
