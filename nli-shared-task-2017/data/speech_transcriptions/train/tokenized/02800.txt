To Rome to Rome I would suggest them to Rome because I live in Italy and Rome is considered a center of culture in Italy .
And uh they being while being in Rome they could visit a lot of uh spots like monument and all the ancient uh uh ruins from the Roman Empire .
And uh there is also the opportunity for them to visit uh to attend to uh big number of schools , also uh international schools in Rome and it would be useful for them to exchange their culture with uh other people coming from uh worldwide countries .
