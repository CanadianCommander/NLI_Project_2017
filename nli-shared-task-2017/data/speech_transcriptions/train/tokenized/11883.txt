I was given the opportunity to become a head girl in my school days for the high school , and the opportunity was given to me because I was always punctual , I was always prepared and I was always a a good student .
I was good in sports plus I was good in uh studies .
And all the teachers they liked me and I was very obedient student .
I never missed a class and I never ever disobeyed any of my teachers .
