Talk about uh book uh going with stories nothing new and uh I enjoy uh reading this book because it deals with uh First World World War and I 'm French and it 's describes from the point of view of uh German soldier and it showed how this world was n't world of uh the people made made it because it was only 20 and it shows a re - relation between French and German during the war and how the German population perceived is warriors and how they consider themselves and uh I learned a lot about uh tolerance between people .
