One of the interesting books I ever read is Harry Potter .
The reason I first is uh it tells us uh story with fantastic plus in the south .
Second reason is it recalls my past experience when I was a child .
I recall a lovely experience and I share with them .
For example the uh the life in the uh magic school because my a lot of things I have spent .
So I took Harry Potter as one of my favorite books .
