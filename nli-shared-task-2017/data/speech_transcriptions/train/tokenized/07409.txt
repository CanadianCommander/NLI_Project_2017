I read many books more but I preferred the book named The Pearl .
I like this book because it shows , it explains many political and human life that we 're living in .
Also I like this book because it 's it 's it 's a dramatical book that 's talking about how simple people were living normally and their life changes by just getting the or finding the pearl and and changing the life by having more money .
