I think generally what I miss most when I 'm not at my in my own country uh depends on the country where I am .
Uh for instance last year when I was in America , uh one of the things that I missed most uh were things like the like uh that you ca n't get in America or you ca n't get so easily such as bread in a bakery .
You can just get the bread in a normal supermarket .
Another thing that I really missed was uh the transportation systems that are not so good in America as in Europe .
