Well what , what I really like uh what I really miss uh the most about my country when I 'm out is the food .
I really miss the , the Spanish omelet is something that I really like .
And also my friends because I really have a life where my friends are really important for me and when I 'm not with them I really miss them .
Also my family is a really important part of my life and when I can not talk to them and speak to them and speak to them about my daily life is something that I really miss also .
