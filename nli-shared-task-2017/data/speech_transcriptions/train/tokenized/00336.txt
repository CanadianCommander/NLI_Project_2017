The thing I miss most about my home is of course my parents .
Right before I came to Singapore four years ago I uh when I was in China I stayed with my parents almost everyday all right so when I came to Singapore I that was my first time I I left my parents for quite a long time and at the beginning it was so easy because I need to take care of everything by myself all right .
I have to be independent all right I have to be a real grown up yeah and at the beginning actually I miss my parents so a lot yeah .
