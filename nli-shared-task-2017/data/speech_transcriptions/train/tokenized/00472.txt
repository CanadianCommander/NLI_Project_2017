Well , what I did lately was to recreate uh Romans centurion helmet .
I did this for my mother who is a great fun of the Roman empire and I had the will to make a really accurate of a uh actual helmet but of course I could n't work in real steal .
So I had to compromise on the materials but I went in to the Internet , I looked for as many pictures as I could and strive to create recreate it as accurately as possible and this is was a great success for my mother 's birthday and .
