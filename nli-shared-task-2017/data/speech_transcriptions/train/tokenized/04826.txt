Well I like reading novels because novels show that , show how these people think about the , the people and like the view of the earth .
And um I like novels like C. S. Lewis The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe which involve like the Christian perspective and and I really like how he writes about Edmund who becomes a better person while the story goes by .
And um and the lion in the story is a symbol of Jesus Christ and how he suffered for us and that 's very interesting because I am a Christian and I go to church .
i learn about the Christianity .
