Well if I have to choose I of course I 'm going to think of a future career path and if this uh job or this position is promising if I 'm going to accept to find my way in my career path .
And number two is to have the self satisfaction .
I would like to enjoy what I 'm doing .
Best thing is to have your hobby as your job and your job as your hobby .
But if it is not this way then the job will be a heavy burden .
Number three I would like to have the job that is going to give me an opportunity to show any or creativity and uh be innovative .
So I can uh express my talents well .
