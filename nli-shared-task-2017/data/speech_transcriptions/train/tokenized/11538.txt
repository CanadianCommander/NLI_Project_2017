Amongst novels , magazines or the poetries I prefer reading novels .
The main reason for reading novels is they they fantasize the story in front of you .
 are living they 're so adjusted that we are used to reading magazine , we are used to reading poems and even poems make some people think .
So I prefer reading novels so that I can feel the imagination what the writer might have felt while actually writing down the novel and also some novels are really very as in interesting as like the Da Vinci Code which was completely jumped by the controversies led by it and also some of Harold and Kumar and a few more .
