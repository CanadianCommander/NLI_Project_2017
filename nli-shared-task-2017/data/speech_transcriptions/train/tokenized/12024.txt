Um there are many places I would suggest uh for my uh friends from another country .
One of my favorite place is national museum in Seoul .
Uh the first reason why I choose this is that , uh the national museum is newly built is so clean , and the entrance fee is very cheap .
So that uh they can enjoy our culture and historical artifact in this convenience uh place .
In addition to this uh they can uh enjoy many restaurant and shopping mall near this uh national museum .
There are a lot of like traditional restaurant uh artifact shops uh near the national museum , so they can enjoy it so I recommend this .
