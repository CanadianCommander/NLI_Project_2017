What I miss the most about my home when I am away um is of course my family , my parents and my sister .
Um I also miss um some of my personal objects such as my library .
Um I love reading and I have many books and when I go away unable to um bring um all of them with me .
So I 'm always uh very happy to go back and find them .
Um I also miss um I do n't know the um the way I feel at home .
It 's just a feeling that you can not find uh in other places .
