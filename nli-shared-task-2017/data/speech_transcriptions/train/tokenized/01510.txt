The one of the things I miss most when I 'm away from home is my mother .
My mother is a great companion for me , he she comforts me when I 'm alone when I have some problems .
She always prepares some good home food when I which I always miss when I 'm away from her .
Uh in addition to food and her company I love the warmth of the mother , the love and her caring .
These things make me remember her more often I 'm always calling her to make sure I 'm always in contact with her and get a combination .
So in all these things uh about my mother I miss the most when I 'm away .
