If I have friends who want to come to see my city or my country I would suggest them to go to see Machu Picchu which is a place located in Cusco in the high mountains on my country .
Machu Picchu is an example of the architecture from the Inca culture .
And they are saying the Inca culture this is very famous around the world .
Another city that I would suggest to visitors or friends is Lima town .
Uh this Lima is especially because it 's the capital of my country and in Lima you can find a lot of sample of architecture that are being influenced from the Spain government .
And so for those reason I think that I would suggest friends to visit Lima and Machu Picchu in Cusco .
