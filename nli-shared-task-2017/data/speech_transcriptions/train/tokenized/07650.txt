What I miss most at my home when I 'm away is obviously two things .
The first things is the um my familiar place , uh or where I live and the streets of the house and what , what I see , because I really like the city where I live .
The second things is very important for me is that uh is my friends , I really miss my friends because I usually see them and speak with them for along time .
This is one of the reason I really like to , to .
