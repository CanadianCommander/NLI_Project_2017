When I 'm away from home , I mostly miss my family and my friends .
My family because they 're they 're really the next native to me native people to me and the friends always have been people your you can call and talk to and share your your experiences to with and there are some little things you miss that is actually the newspaper to be up to date what is happening on the world and little thing as um we can say the breakfast from the bakery .
The bakery is really good in my home town and so I really miss those pretzels and those little little little breads and most of all our local beer which is time .
