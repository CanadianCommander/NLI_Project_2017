I think The Catcher in the Rye was really interesting to read because in fact there was n't any story or something like that .
It was just about this one person uh who has really psychological problems and uh well , she des - , he described his opinion , he described what he thou - thought about the people around him and I think that was really interesting , interesting .
Uh further I think uh how the book is written it 's really uh interesting to read and you want to continue always , you ca n't stop to read it .
It 's like a good movie you watch .
That 's why I really preferred to read this book from Salinger .
