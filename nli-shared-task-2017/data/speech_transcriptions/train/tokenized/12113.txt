Well of late uh the book that I have read uh I found to be most interest is uh called Rich Dad Poor Dad by the author being Robert T. Kiyosaki .
I found the book to be interesting because it gives a very different concept of how we actually use money in our lives and how it basically , you know revolves around uh our being .
And uh specifically speaking it tells us as to how uh our parents teach us about money and uh about life and how we actually learn learn the same uh things and we pass them to I mean the same things to the next gen ration , we do n't pass on anything new .
This book tells us about some new concepts which actually we are able to redefine our thinking .
