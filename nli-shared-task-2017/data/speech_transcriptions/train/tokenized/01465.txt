I like reading books that help with self development , uh this kind of books makes uh me more of developed in a way that I 'm uh that I want to be multiple .
For example it can be how to manage my time uh it can be a book about this or it can be about uh a book about how to communicate with people .
Uh I would like uh generally uh be reading this kind of books because I believe that this kind of gives the books give some uh useful information uh about life and about my future career .
and I think that we must use our time in a good way to develop ourselves .
