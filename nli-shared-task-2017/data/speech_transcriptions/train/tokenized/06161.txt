When I am away from my home , I usually miss food and friends .
Food is the most thing I miss because when I 'm away from home I had to eat from outside which I do not like much .
I like specifically home cooked food and the next thing I miss is are my friends .
The friends I made when during my interaction during my my the < % > people , I miss them the most .
I miss the the way I played with them , I enjoyed with them and spend most beautiful time with them .
