An accomplishment I was given , was to organize a journey to a park .
It was very interesting and very hard to prepare because uh I want used , I was n't used to do such kind of uh things .
But I learned a lot uh and because I allowed to take the leadership of the group and to organize all the things that uh concerned with uh a journey .
The journey went very well and everything uh and nothing was wrong with it .
