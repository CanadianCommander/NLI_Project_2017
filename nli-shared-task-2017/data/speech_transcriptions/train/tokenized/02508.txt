If I wanted to choose a job specific career , I would still choose the job uh that I am in .
I work as a chief technology officer uh for uh technology company and I think uh this is a job suited for my skills and my talents .
I 've uh always uh had the uh uh uh uh uh a liking for technology and uh being able to contribute so significantly with my skill sets as an engineer and developing road maps with the company has been very rewarding so if I could choose a career I 'd still go into the career I 'm in which is uh doing what uh doing exactly , uh working for it .
