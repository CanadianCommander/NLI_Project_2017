Well , five years ago , I was given the opportunity to um learn how to pilot a plane .
So um I found it very challenging in as much as it enabled me to um well to prove that I was able to um act with many rigor .
I mean , it was such a task so uh so um I mean you have a ma - um very um a lot of fear to overcome and um well it 's very very interesting and when you travel along uh the clouds in the sky , what you feel is absolutely marvelous so uh it 's worth trying it and I will uh tell you to try it .
