One time I was given the chance to hold an actual living alligator in my hands .
Um a friend 's dad he is a reptilo - reptile ologist and um he has an aquarium with various alligators in them .
So he gave me one and I held it and it was a special occurrence for me because I was always kind of scared of reptiles .
So holding this actual alligator in a safe environment for me , a safe environment with this person I trusted and knew was a very good experience .
And um this was very nice for my personality as well because I learned how to get rid of fears .
Also the result of it was that I 'm not scared animal uh alligators anymore .
