The first and the foremost that I would be missing is my family .
I share a lot of things with my family , I discuss my progress with my father which gives me the much needed relief .
And uh other thing which I will be missing is my friends .
I enjoy a lot with my friends , I hang out in the weekends with my friends , I watch films and I play a lot of games with my friends and I will be missing all these .
And finally I would be missing the city gives beautiful weather conditions and also I will be missing the challenging environment which it provides now .
