Well an accomplishment that require me to work very hard was um getting my bachelors from Angelo State University in Texas .
Um I was allowed to go there because I got a scholarship and I was super excited to go there but it was very very difficult for me .
Because A I came over there and I did n't understand the people and B the culture was so so different , and C I was studying in journalism and uh in Germany I never study Journalism before .
So all of a sudden I had to do video work and I had to do photo editing and I did n't have any clue and everything single so new for me but with the help of many many people um I completed and I 'm pretty proud of it and I 'm think about this time very much and I just love it .
