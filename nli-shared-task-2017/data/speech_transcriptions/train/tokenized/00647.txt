Most of the time I prefer to read novels because it gives a lot of information and they can cover a lot of interest which I 'm interested in , like sociology , physiology , crime .
These are a lot things to read , and the more time I spend on reading the more fun I have .
that 's why I prefer novels to reading most of the time .
Only in uh bathroom I prefer to read magazines because these are light things to read like sports magazines or music magazines .
