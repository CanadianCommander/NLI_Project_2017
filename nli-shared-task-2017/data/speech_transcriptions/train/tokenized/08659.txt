Study and work often often take me away from my home .
When I 'm away from my home I generally miss the food , the love , the care I get all there but what the most I miss is the beautiful atmosphere at my at my countryside town .
If far away from the uh the political environment of the city and we have city locals bounty .
It 's just it 's just amazing a when you 're when you food , the food is the best for that is what I feel .
Better than eating out the home food cooked by mom with love and affection it really , it really makes me make homesick sometimes .
That 's all .
