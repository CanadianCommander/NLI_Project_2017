Um from the reading materials uh I would prefer uh magazines and newspapers .
I think uh because uh when you start reading a magazine you do n't have to finish it uh on on time or in a and you do n't need a vast time and uh also you keep in touch with the current events uh by reading a uh newspaper or a magazine .
It will give you uh a lot of information from different topics and uh at least some of the topics you will find interesting maybe not all of them .
Um also um since I 'm a student I do n't have enough time to read a lot of uh books or long uh .
