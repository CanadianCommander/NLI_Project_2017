I will take my friend to Berlin first of all because it 's the capital city of Germany .
It 's very big and thriving and there are many things to do there like uh theatres and other culture events .
And moreover , it has a very big historical importance .
Berlin used to be divided into a western and eastern part after World War Two .
And I think this historical rele - uh relevance and all the important museums and other places you can see , are one reason why I would take my friends to see that .
Um highly influential important place for German history .
