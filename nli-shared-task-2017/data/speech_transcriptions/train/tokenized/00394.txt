The quality I think makes someone a valuable member of a team is supportive-ness and friendly and he is very determined to play towards the team .
Without achieving his personal goal , a person 's goal , you should have to play for the team and you should be friendly with all the members .
We know that and when the team is going to lose we should not be worried about that .
We should cheer so that the supportive-ness will be supportive-ness will be and play about this condition .
So that the quality makes someone valuable member of team .
