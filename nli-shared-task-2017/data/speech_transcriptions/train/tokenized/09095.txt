Take my friends to the city of Tijuana because it is the most important frontier in the world , where millions of people cross every year to San Diego of the United States of California of America .
Uh why Tijuana ?
Another reason for why Tijuana , because is multicultural .
The reason of this multicultural aspect is that , uh various persons from other countries try t cross the boarder everyday .
So if they fail in their attempt to cross to the United States , they stay in Tijuana and diverge their culture among Mexicans .
