The one quality that that I think that someone should possess to be a valuable member of a team is flexibility .
Flexibility in the general sense means the player should be adaptable to the various situations that my throw up in him .
The maybe in sports or in uh or in educational or training institute could need persons who are flexibility and adaptable to situations , whatever it may be .
In whichever field you are in , you 'll always come across highs and lows , whether it is a sport or a business and you need your team members to be flexible enough and adaptable enough to to really face these problems .
So would be person who is the most valuable .
