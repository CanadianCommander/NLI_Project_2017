Since I I currently come from Spain and I 'm living in Germany I especially miss my home .
I miss uh my family , my brothers , sisters and I also miss other things in Spain for example the weather .
The weather is much nicer than in Germany , there is more sun , more light .
And there are many activities that I can do in the outside because of the weather things that I currently can not do here in Germany .
Another thing that I really miss is the food , not only the food that is cooked by my mum but also the food that I can .
