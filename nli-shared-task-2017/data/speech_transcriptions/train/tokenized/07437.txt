Once in my school I was in the drama class and uh for the play that we would uh perform , which was Romeo and Juliet .
I had to choreography the dance , the mask dance that was in the play .
The task was hard for me to accomplish because many of the dancers which I had to uh teach how to dance did n't ever dance before .
So they were , they were n't prepared and I had to teach them basically from the beginning and it was easy accomplish .
But uh it was a very important task to me because I really cared about that class and I wanted to uh , to have , the teacher to have a very good impression of me .
