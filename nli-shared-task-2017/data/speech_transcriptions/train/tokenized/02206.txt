My hometown is Vienna , actually I admit that the thing that I miss most is it 's cultural variance to be able to stroll around in the city , drop in a museum , see some great painting or just kind of an art that you are definitely not able to see here in Switzerland to go to the Cinema , go to different bars , watch a musical and stuff like that .
I really love the culture .
And of course I sometimes miss my family , I 've never been the homesick kind type but I do miss them sometimes and of course my friends just hang out , go for a coffee and see them because I 've been away for quite sometime now .
