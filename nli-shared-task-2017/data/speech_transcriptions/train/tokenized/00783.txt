The thing I miss the most when I 'm away out of home it 's uh of course my my family my friends being with them that 's the most important .
And after that i would say the weather because I live in a very sunny place and and that 's something that really uh helps uh sunny and warm and also the food as well .
The food is important because I I really like the Mediterranean diet uh typical for where I live and for example in England , the food is terrible for me I 'm sorry to say that .
