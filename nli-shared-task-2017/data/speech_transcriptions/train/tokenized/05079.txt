A big accomplishment of mine is uh this year I made it to the first team in my uh school 's in my soccer team .
Uh I was n't a very good player at the beginning but um I really trained hard .
Uh it 's like we the team trained like two weeks two days a week and I was always on time , I would always do what the coach said and besides um I would also uh train by myself during the weekends .
I would go um to practice um practice and improve my weakness and luckily after three years of training um I made it to the first team .
I 'm really glad .
