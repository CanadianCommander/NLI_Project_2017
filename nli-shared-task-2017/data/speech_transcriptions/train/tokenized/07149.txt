Uh I had to prepare the board exams on dentistry .
It was very hard to prepare because the , the , the subject was so vast and I put all my time to study for four years , then then it came .
Because if I failed the test the next test will be on next year , so and then I had to go for military training then if I failed another second time I have to go to military .
