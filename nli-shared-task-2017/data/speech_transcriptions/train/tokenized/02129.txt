If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country , uh I prefer uh them to visit uh the ancient city uh which is called Ephesus .
Is close to my uh home city uh and it 's really in uh I mean a really interesting place because , there you can uh see uh many types of ancient Greek uh culture uh in that uh city .
Uh and also it includes um old ancient buildings uh which is still uh I mean .
Uh they uh really keep their uh , uh visibility , uh and it 's really interesting uh to uh go around in the city .
