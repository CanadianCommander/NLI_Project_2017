I think uh one of the first things that I miss when I 'm away from home is my parents , my friends and uh of course the food .
I miss my parents because uh they 're an inspiration for me so whenever I 'm away from my home I can not miss them .
Food is a very important factor if you 're away and uh it 's very the home food is very healthy and it 's very good for me .
And uh the , if you just keep on eating the outside food it does not do good things for the stomach .
So these are the things that I miss when I 'm away from home .
