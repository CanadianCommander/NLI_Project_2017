I was given a task of uh developing a a programs in uh an un-penetrated market .
Uh un-penetrated market meaning that we had no presence whatsoever previously .
Because we had no presence , we had no materials .
We need , I had to do a lot of study about the market and also uh plus do a lot of research and do a lot of preparation to go into the market uh because I started with nothing to work with and then at the end we got through the market and achieve a great result because of the preparation that was done .
