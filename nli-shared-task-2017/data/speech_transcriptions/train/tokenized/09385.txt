Accomplishment that I was required to work very hard to me was learning English to go to England .
First of all is very hard because well I had to learn English to go to England and I was in year four , I mean year six and is very hard to um learn a new language when I was but fully understood with my own mother language Korean .
So it require me to work very hard to connect the new words into the words I already knew .
And second of all I had to move to England , well as I was foreign a foreign country I had to learn uh the culture and also the language is very hard to learn , it took me a lot of times .
So this was the hard work .
