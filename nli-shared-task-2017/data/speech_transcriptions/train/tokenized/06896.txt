The special opportunity that was given to me was uh the chance of being an exchange student in Denmark .
Uh it was important for two reasons .
First , it was a chance given to me um to be in Europe .
I had been in the U in , in the US before but I had n't been in Europe so it was the first time for me to get experienced in Europe and to see how different it is from Turkey .
So uh the second reason is to get educated for a semester in a different university which uh contributed to my um academic knowledge and experience very much .
And I in the end appreciated um so much .
