Well first of all I , I miss of course my family and my friends and uh I miss all the my activities that I do at home like on the couch or something and um there are like there are a lot of things I do in my my hometown like go out with my friends and have fun and and something like this and all kind of all things I do there I can do when I 'm away .
So you know , the main aspect uh I miss when I 'm away is my my friends and my family and all the material stuff is not so much important for me .
