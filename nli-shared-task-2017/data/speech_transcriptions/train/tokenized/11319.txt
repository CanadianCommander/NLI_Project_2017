Okay .
Actually I would say and as as I come from a coast town uh I really miss it when I 'm when I am abroad and I am away .
And Uh on the other hand uh I am able to feel how manage town or city uh stands on the sea and what else uh of course I do miss I do miss people of my town , I do miss uh it 's attitude and I know it 's uh definition but uh I think also running out of time but uh what else I I miss .
I do n't miss my home , no .
