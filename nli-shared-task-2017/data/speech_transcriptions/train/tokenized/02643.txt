The last interesting book I 've read uh was an autobiography uh about Robert Moses who was uh the building director of New York in the beginning of the twentieth century .
It was uh interesting and uh in in in in many ways as uh he faced many political uh enemies during his career and also uh was uh prone to uh accumulate a lot of political power on the other side .
He was never in a political positio - position .
He was never a senator or a , or a mayor of New York .
He was uh simply uh the building senator and he had so much influence .
