Well I think to be a good member of a team you have to be dynamic you have to nice clear , you have to listen carefully to everyone and you have to be able to answer and to um give your opinion clearly as it 's it could be a good thing to be a bit dominant .
You must have good ideas and you have to go to be uh nice to everyone .
Uh you also have to to have a good um position in the group and uh to know the qualities of everyone and to be to have something special .
That difference is you of the other people of the group .
