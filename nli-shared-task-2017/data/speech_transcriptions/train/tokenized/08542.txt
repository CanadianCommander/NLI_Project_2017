What I miss most about uh about my home when I am away is the comfortness .
First I , I can not , I , I can not sleep well at outside .
And I can make uh a deep sleep in home .
And second is the food at home is more su - suited to me .
And the food outside does n't fit well to me .
And also it 's not delicious .
So I feel more comfort , comfortable when I am at home .
