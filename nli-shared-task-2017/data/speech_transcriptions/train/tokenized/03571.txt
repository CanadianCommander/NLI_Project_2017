I was given a special opportunity to travel throughout Australia by obtaining uh working holiday visa .
And uh this was a very special opportunity for me because it gave me the experience of traveling through a a foreign country .
And uh I was able to sustain myself in different ways , taking on different jobs .
Um also I could um explore the nature of this beautiful continent and uh meet the culture , the the friendly culture and the people living in Australia .
And that 's why I think that was a very special opportunity given to me , and that 's why I loved traveling throughout Australia .
