One of the interesting , most interesting books that I 've ever read was uh Salman Rushdie Midnight 's Children .
First of all I had some prejudices against the book actually because of the satanic verses or uh notorious satanic verses like but uh after I read the Midnight 's Children I think those uh prejudices were wrong and uh I really liked uh uh the writer 's talking about independence process of India and his uh family and himself is uh are moving back and forth between Pakistan and India and how his main land uh uh impor - uh important for him .
