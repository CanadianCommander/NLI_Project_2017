The best book I read is the Greatest Comeback by the People .
This book illust - many examples in which people came back from the critical situations and they uh achieved whatever they want .
They are given the example of uh one guy who do n't have his legs but he lost his legs during some accident but still he can play the basketball very well and the processed , uh and the mindset through which he has gone .
So this book helps a lot in building your mind to get what you want and towards success .
