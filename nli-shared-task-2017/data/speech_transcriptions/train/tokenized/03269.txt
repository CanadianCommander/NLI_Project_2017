If my friends will come to my country I will suggest them to visit Udaipur which is also called the Kashmir of Rajasthan .
It is a heritage city which has many places .
It is a city of lakes and it is obviously a city where most of the students from various countries visit .
So I wo - I would suggest my friends to come here in Udaipur and spend their time .
Whatever the city of lakes and it is surrounded by many lakes called uh Fateh Sagar , Pichola etcetera .
