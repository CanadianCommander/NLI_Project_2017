When I 'm away from home I miss my parents most .
I miss the time I spend with them , the dinner time when we talk about various things , we have fun at all if we pull each other 's legs .
And then of course the whole made food by my mother , the the the curry that she makes it 's it 's awesome .
I miss the fights that I have with my younger brother and sisters with pillows and small small things that are kept on the bed .
I am I become a child when I am with them , I miss my dad 's scowling , yeah he 's very strict and I miss all those things .
I miss my friends who live right adjacent to my house when we go out to play in the field cricket , football or basketball .
I miss all these things , I miss my television , and I I stick to the this box most of the time and I seriously miss it .
