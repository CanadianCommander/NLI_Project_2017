I believe the major thing that comes the team is uh team sharing thoughts .
If a person is not having team sharing thoughts is not a team player .
A team player is supposed to share each and everything with his colleagues so that they can work on it .
Suppose in a case they are not working with the same fact then it will be hard for others to take up what exactly the other person is doing or also it brings separative fences and one trying to hide his feelings or thoughts over the particular thing he 's aware of or he 's aware how they can just speed up or expedite the things so that they can reach the conclusion the fast way .
I believe if it 's not being a part of team is not a team p-layer , that 's it .
