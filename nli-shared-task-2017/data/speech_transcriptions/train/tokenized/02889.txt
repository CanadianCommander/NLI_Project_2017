I was studying unt - in Korea until um I was seventh grade but after eighth grade I went to South Africa and America .
I think this is my special opportunity that I was , that was given to me .
Many friends of mine in Korea they study same kind of things but they teach the s - teachers of the Korea teach them differently .
They try to push them the knowledge instead of wisdom into their head and in America the teachers are trying to teach me how to solve the problem not what the problem is and I think that 's a really important thing to to learn before I go to college and that 's my special opportunity .
