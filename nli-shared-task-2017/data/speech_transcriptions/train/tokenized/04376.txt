I would sugge - suggest I combine some places of the country .
I would um start in Madrid which is the main city , uh it has a lot of cultural reasons to visit .
Also I will , I will suggest them to go the north of Spain to the parts of Asturias and Aretha which are I think the most beautiful places in the whole country .
And also one of the most beautiful a cultural basis of the country .
I would go also to the south because that 's the topic everyone thinks about when they , they come to Spain so they have to be satisfied with that .
