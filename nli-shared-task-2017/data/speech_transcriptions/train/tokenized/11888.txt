I enjoy reading novels um especially short stories because I find them very entertaining and not as long .
I find that sometimes very long novels can be kind of boring .
Uh magazine wise I enjoy reading magazines such as Time and NewsWeek which are international you know based magazines which let you know what 's going on in the world .
I really enjoy reading about what 's going on in other countries .
I also have a of enjoying Hello magazine and gossip magazine similar about Britney Spears and all .
And overall I just like reading and being informed and that 's what I enjoy .
