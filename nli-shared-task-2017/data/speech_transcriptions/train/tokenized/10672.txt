I 'd like the book of nicknamed uh Not Without my Daughter , which is a story about American wo - lady who married with the Iranian man and go to Iran for a two-weeks holiday .
She and she and her daughter has been hostage and she tried to escape from Iran to America .
The book was quite interesting for me ` cause I could see see the different culture of Iran , different idea or where and yeah and different things .
