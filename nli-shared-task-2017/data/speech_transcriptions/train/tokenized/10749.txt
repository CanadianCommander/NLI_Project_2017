Well many times in my life uh I 've been away from home .
It means sometimes it was uh really far away and what I most uh when I 'm far from home is first of all my family and I remember when I was little uh I used to cry a lot and uh this does n't happen anymore and the second thing I I miss most is uh the habits I have when I when I am far from home which can be the food I eat uh is usually happened uh this happened to me uh when I was in the United States .
I just could n't stand the food that we we ate there .
And also my habits and the way I live .
