Right now I 'm on a boarding school and to learn special English and I overall miss my family because we are so tight together .
I usually go to my aunt 's house and we will have lunch there , I will babysit their childrens and then my , our cousins will come over and we will always have a lot of fun uh , sharing our our experiences of the day .
And uh I also miss my friends and the freedom I have in my house because anytime I wanna go out of my , of the school uh it restricts you .
However , when I was in , when I 'm in uh back in my house my mother let me do anything I want as long as I uh do all the work that 's .
