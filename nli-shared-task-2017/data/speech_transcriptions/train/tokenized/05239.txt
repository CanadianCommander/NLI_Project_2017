I think the leader its uh it is the important person in the team because it is the one that is going to tell the others what to do .
And in a group people always need to follow someone to give them direction is the person that is going uh help then in the discussions they have or whatever they are working with .
Uh the leader uh needs to take care of everyone listen to everyone he kind of directs them in the direction that the team wants to go .
Um I think the other members are also important but without the leader , leader uh it is too hard to have good team and probably the team would have the same success .
