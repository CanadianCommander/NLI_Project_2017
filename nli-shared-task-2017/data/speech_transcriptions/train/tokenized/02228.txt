My dream career it would be a surgeon .
In hospital I could help people which was the most grateful thing that I think that I could do in the world .
And use my uh knowledge and my ability to helping people really fulfill my life .
So surgeon will be my ideal job for my future .
And further more being a surgeon can not only fulfill my uh willings to help people it can only achieve a fulfillment of more knowledges and abilities to know more people .
To know the world better through the con - uh contacts with the nurses with the patients and with the whole environment .
