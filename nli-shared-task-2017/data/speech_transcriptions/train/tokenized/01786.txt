One of the most uh interesting books that I have read read recently Hobbits .
Uh it 's a kind of scientific uh science fiction .
Uh it 's not only based on real story but uh most of the ca - uh most of the situations uh it 's based on uh creatures and dream world .
Uh I read this book because I believe that by reading this popular book uh I may enter some new societies that I can talk about uh different people .
Uh what is interesting about this book is also uh it has three themes of uh of the the of the this uh book which are called uh ri - uh rings .
Uh that 's all I can say .
