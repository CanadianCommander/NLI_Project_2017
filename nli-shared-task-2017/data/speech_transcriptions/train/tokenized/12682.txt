The most interesting book that I 've read is Harry Potter .
The first reason is because the story , the story is very exciting since the story is about magic and the witches stuff which I 'm very interested in .
I feel like I am in the story an actually part of it .
Second reason is because I can see how the author of this novel , J. K. Rowling , put in too much effort to , to when she is writing this novel before she became popular .
She was , uh she was a renowned female writer and a single mom who had struggled to raise a child by herself and and she worked harder and harder and when the , when the book was published it became the best seller .
