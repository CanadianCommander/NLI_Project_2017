I think for a person in a team it 's very important that he gets a long with everybody , with all the members in the team , and that he can communicate and talk in front , with other people and communicate with the other members .
And that he is a capable member , so that everyone likes him , so that he can avoid um , um pressure and that they do n't have fights within the team .
Um I feel yeah I think that 's very important .
