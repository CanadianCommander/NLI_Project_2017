Having studied in a boarding school , I 've always missed my how whenever I 've been away studying .
Then as graduates , I entered into a graduate school , much , much far away from my sch - home .
So I 've been always missing my home being away .
The most important thing that I missed is my mum , my dad , the love and care , the home cooked food of my mum is uh sumptuous .
Like I 'll never get this food ever again .
The comfort of my home in extreme summers .
The air conditioners and the warmth and the cosiness that I get in my coat in the winters .
And then I miss my care that my , that my parents provide me with .
Like they 're always there for me whenever I need them .
So I always miss my home .
