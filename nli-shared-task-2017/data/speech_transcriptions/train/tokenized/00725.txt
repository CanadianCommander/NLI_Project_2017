The last interesting book I read was um Solo Album .
It 's a German book written the german author Benjamin Stuckrad-Barre .
Um this book is about a young man uh who is left by his girlfriend .
He feels really lonely and is um and he does n't know what to do next .
He tries to to win the girl back but it does n't work .
He tries several things and this book is good because many young people have been in the same situation .
