Three years ago , I got the opportunity to make in France , a country that I like very much and I also uh speak French and this was my uh opportunity to , a chance to uh gain some experience abroad , to meet French people and to see and think uh in the way that they see the world .
And uh yeah it enriched my life and uh my way of thinking and it gave me uh positive uh impression of this culture and even today I still continue travelling and meeting my friends there as a result .
