When I 'm away from my home I , I miss really my family and all the love they provide me , it is very difficult to be uh , to be uh far when , when maybe you do n't know the people .
And also I miss all my home pages , all the environments and uh all the things that I usually do and see uh , when I look around me .
And um uh the last things I uh which amazes my , my two turtels , um I really like them very much and so it is quite difficult when I , when I 'm not near my home .
