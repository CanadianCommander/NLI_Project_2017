Some of the interesting book I have read is uh named Winning and it was written by Jack Welch the ex-CEO of General Electrics .
I found it very useful especially for my job career .
He was uh reporting plenty of usefu - useful business cases and it was very useful to me because uh it let me apply some of those concept which were mentioned and described , fully described into my real life , into my business cases .
So by reading that book I really got like an additional experience in my job which was later on very appreciated by my supervisors .
