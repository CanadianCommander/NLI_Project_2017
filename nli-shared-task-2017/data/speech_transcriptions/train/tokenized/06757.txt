Mem - , I think that a very important member , quality for a member of a team is to know how to make sacrifice .
Uh , it 's very important to understand what is the overall objective of the team to work together to achieve the goal .
And at times you might have to make some sacrifice on a personal level in order to help the team achieve its goals , its objectives in the best way possible .
So it 's very important to understand what are the priorities and if your personal needs uh sometimes are not coherent with the group , you have to know how to make sacrifice in order to choose the better good of the group .
