Recently I 've read um the book of J. K. Rowling name Harry Potter .
Um this famous book talks about um magic and uh a gir - a boy name Harry that tries to figure out about his own magic or and all these .
It was very interesting because uh it pre - it allows us to see as about the new world to imagine new uh possibilities and ways of lives and purposes .
This is imagination and all that .
So it was very interesting to uh read that kind of books because yeah magic is yeah another world which we had to have lived .
It 's normal to us .
