Um in my free time I like to read um various types of such as novels , magazines and poetry .
The magazines that I ussually read are Cosmopolitan , Hello , Fashion and which are based on fashion and the Hollywood stars and stories .
And they are interesting because they are full of stories that I would not find out otherwise and the novels I usually enjoy are the ones recommended by the teachers and um my other peers from schools .
They are very interesting because I get to imagine like look into the imagination and read something that I would not experience in my real life , such as fiction and mystery novels .
