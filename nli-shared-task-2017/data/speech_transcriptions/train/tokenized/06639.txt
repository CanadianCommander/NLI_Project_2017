The accomplishment I would like to talk about is the GMAT I 've just taken about a month ago .
I was able to get a seven hundred on GMAT and that accomplishment is really important for me but because without a high GMAT score you would be impo - impossible for me to get into a good MBA program .
Um and without MBA program with will be without a credential MBA program will be hard for me to get ideal job .
So I think high score in GMAT was a really high accomplishment to me and it was really important to me .
