Magazines are the reading material that I prefer because of two reasons .
They share current topics that are really important for every student to know and I am able to see the point of view of many all sorts of writers that are really prepared .
Therefore , magazines are for me uh just an incredible material to to see a different perspective that you normally gain from newspapers , from TV or other type of sources , but I think it 's always good just to to read something different that is not so so long and that that shares these two characteristics .
