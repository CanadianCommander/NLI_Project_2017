I read newspaper paper daily and , and uh I use to read books when I was like small uh to uh , it was like this kid type , kid , the kids stories one , the goose bumps , where I really enjoyed it because it has like , it had like uh uh adventure and uh stories .
But now , where I , I 'm not a person who reads them , so I read the newspaper , which is , which is more important to me because I know it 's a daily , it tells you about uh , uh what 's happening here and there and this is what I 'm , I really like .
