There is a lot of different kind of reading materials that I read in my free time such as novels , magazines or poetry .
Uh however , I prefer to read uh novels if when I have my free time because novels make peoples uh imagine a lot or easily .
For example , my work is uh performance in stage everyday , I mean I play music .
So I have to play uh music .
So I have to imagine a lot so that I can um play so beautifully .
