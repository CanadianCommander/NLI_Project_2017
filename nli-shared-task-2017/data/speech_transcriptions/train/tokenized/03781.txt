Harry Porter is very book that I have read .
It talks about magic and the life about a boy as because uh magic is a thing that does n't exist in the real world , I think it was very interesting to read about and that only magic was talked the word in the story .
Uh a life about a boy who does n't uh did n't have parents since he was a baby was illustrated very delicately and inside of the boy also was very well illustrated .
