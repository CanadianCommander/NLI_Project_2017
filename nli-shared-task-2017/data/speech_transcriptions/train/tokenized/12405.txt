Uh I prefer my friends to visit Istanbul and Ontario .
And uh Onta - because Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities that people are willing to visit .
And these are my following ideas .
Firstly , it has a culture and history .
For example , Topkapi Palace is a palace that shows the welfare of the Ottoman 's life .
Furthermore , there are several museu - museums and pla - palaces to visit .
Uh in addition to this , it has a characteristic lifestyle .
For instance , one can have a delicious meal from Turkish cuisine , near the Bosphorus and um and .
