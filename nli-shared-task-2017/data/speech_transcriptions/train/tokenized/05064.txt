I prefer reading novels because I um like to imagine uh things .
I like to read fantasy stories but also historical stories because it 's both very fascinating and um appealing to me .
I think um stories uh I 'm especially interesting because you can learn something about um your own day to day life about how everything would you like to see um experience uh come into being .
Not like uh fantasy stories because it is something that is really different from your day to day life .
