If friends from another country were going to visit me , I 'd firstly visit with them the city of Cologne .
Because I live here and I have lived here ever since I was born .
In Cologne we 'd go first with the visiting the dome and so on so the streets around the whole town and yeah .
After Cologne we would visit Berlin which is the capital city and the uh where the , where the legislation works .
After Berlin we would go to Munster , because I 'm going to live there in the future .
