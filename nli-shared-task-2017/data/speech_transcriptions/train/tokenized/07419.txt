One of my greatest accomplishment was qualifying the Joint Entrance Examination uh for entrance into uh Indian Institute of Technologies .
Um this was so because uh this are , this is a very prestigious exam and it is very tough to qualify .
Around three hundred thousand people sit for this exam and only one percent of them get through .
So I guess this was um the one of the most major accomplishment in my life .
That 's all .
