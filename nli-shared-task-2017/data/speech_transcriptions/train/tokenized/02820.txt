An accomplishment that require to work very hard was uh a project I had at university .
It was an experimental uh thing I had to do and we had to go into the laboratory and uh to question people in order to test something and then we had phy - uh physiological measurements and the problem was that we are working in a group and some of the group members were uh I think , they were very un-experienced in what we were doing and so they made some mistakes and afterwards I had to write a text in order to sum at what uh kind of results we have come to and uh it was very important for me because my grades were very dependent on that , okay .
