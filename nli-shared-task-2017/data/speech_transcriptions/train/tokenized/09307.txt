Um if I could have any job or career that I wanted I will be a dental surgeon because I 've always wanted to be some where in dental area .
And plus I 'm really interested in biology and chemistry and also physics .
So that would help me to focus to become a dental surgeon .
And mainly because I wanna learn about how the teeth structure were arranged and that would be it .
