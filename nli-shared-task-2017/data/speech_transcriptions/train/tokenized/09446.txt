Uh the most interesting book I have read uh its name is Illusions .
It 's about a man who used to get his living from moving from one city to another giving people rides on his uh old airplanes .
And then one day he meets another guy also he is a a pilot for airplanes .
Um they used to travel together from that from that time and he learned a lot from that stranger .
He gives him a lot of experience in life and how could how you could learn from life and how you could uh how you could do everything .
That 's very interesting book for me .
