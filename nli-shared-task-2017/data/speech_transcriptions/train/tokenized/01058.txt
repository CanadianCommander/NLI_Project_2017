I think I would take him for the Paris because it has a very interesting points .
In architecture for example , lots of old buildings and a lot of cultural interesting structures .
There are a lot of also a lot of museums , and I think it would be a good start to , for him to understand this culture .
I would also take him to uh short trip in the country side where my family is living so that he can see the beautiful landscapes of France , and the rural habits extra .
