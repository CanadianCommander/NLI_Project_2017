I remember that when I first started at my recent job which is Interactive College of Technology , I started as a receptionist .
And one day it happened that the , the assistant of the president was sick for about a week and they really need someone to do administrative jobs in the corporate office .
And uh my manager has asked me to go there and give them some help , which I did enthusiastically .
And uh from there they had move me up to the Human Resources Department because they have seen my ability to do , that I was more qualified for the reception desk area .
And um I I was given more opportunity to work .
