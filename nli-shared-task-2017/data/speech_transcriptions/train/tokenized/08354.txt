What I most uh miss when I was away home is the family an secondary is food .
Uh at first is very important to me uh to uh to have this family and because this family .
Because of their their and opinion depending on them and they are always happy .
In any case it 's also if I live if I live alone uh I really I really have to uh prepare my food my own it 's it 'll be very hard and uh and so uh this is my opinion .
