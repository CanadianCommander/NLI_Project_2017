One one of the greatest accomplishments that required me to work very hard is to uh learn and speak English and it was very difficult for me because I 'm not uh living in in in country all of the people who speak in English .
So I have to spend more time to listen or read uh to understand , to talk and to practice my skills for uh speaking and uh listening of English language .
