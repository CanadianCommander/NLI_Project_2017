Well what I like mostly in my free time is actually novels and all kind of different languages because through reading them I get a lot of inspiration , I learn a lot about new ideas about the world and I want to learn a lot about foreign languages .
Um what I do actually read most are more technical journals on economics or news about economics where I learn much more about my profession on recent trends uh or things that happen in different markets because I happen to be in the investment business where I need this for my day to day work .
Or because I work in foreign countries I read about uh what happens in this countries especially about what happens in East Asia .
