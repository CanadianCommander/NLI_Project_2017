My friends are the most thing I miss when I 'm not at home because with them I will be at a university and I have a lot of stress and something else and when I come home , I I really to see my friends , to like my pa - uh to see my parents and which makes me very happy .
It feels me it gives me a better feeling and also the the familiar environment in which I live in at home .
It 's makes a better sense that 's the na - I like the nature , I like working there and I have a lot of fun there .
And I like to work to help my parents in , they both have injuries and it gives me a contrast to the university .
