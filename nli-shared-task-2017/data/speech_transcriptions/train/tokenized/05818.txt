Last summer I was given a very great opportunity to go visit the country of Italy with some of my peers from school .
Um I went for about ten days and we flew to Sicily first , and we toured a couple of cities in Sicily .
And we then we took a ferry over to Italy and then we were able to tour and visit my of the cities in Italy .
It was a great opportunity for me to get to know more of the people at my school and become friends with them .
And also to learn about Italian and Sicilian culture and to see and tour all the beautiful sites and cities that the country has to offer .
