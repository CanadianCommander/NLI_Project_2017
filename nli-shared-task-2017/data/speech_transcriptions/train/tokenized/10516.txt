When I 'm away I most my family and friends of course .
My family is really important to me and my friends are too .
I have this very good friend and I always meet with her in Saturday mornings .
And when we ca n't do this , this is really something that I miss .
What I also miss is especially when I 'm in a big town like New York for example is , since I live in a small city and I live the rural environment .
We have a lake there and we are surrounded by mountains .
And so this is really , this is really something I miss when I 'm away .
And um so it 's always nice to come back home again .
