When I 'm away from home , what I miss most is of course my family because uh there is such great persons .
Uh I also miss my pets because I 'm very emotional and I 'm really attached to animals .
And of course my room .
Because I need my place , my own universe where I can uh relax and uh just , just uh do whatever I want to , um .
