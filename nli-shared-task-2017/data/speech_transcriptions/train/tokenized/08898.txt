I was an exchange student and decided to last year and my home country is Turkey .
And when I was away from my home I feel the thing I most I missed most was my parents and definitely the food .
Unfortunately the food in the United States is not as good as it is in Turkey .
It is not as eclectic and it 's not as healthy .
In Turkey we have really healthy food choices and that 's why when I was in the United States I missed the food a lot .
And also my family means a lot to me so when I was alway from them I miss them even more and that 's it .
