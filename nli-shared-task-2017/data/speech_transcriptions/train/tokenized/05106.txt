I like to read most novels in my free time because they appear the most interesting to me actually or the most entertaining .
Um most of them do describe the uh the imaginary possibilities of the writer .
And they give , they paint a clear picture of the situations they describe .
So , it 's pretty much like a movie when you are reading a novel and that 's really entertaining .
