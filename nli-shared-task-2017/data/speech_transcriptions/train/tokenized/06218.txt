The book I recently read about was marketing on marketing and its name was a Strategic Marketing Management .
Uh I think the book was really interesting stories .
Uh I am uh really interested in marketing issues uh and uh I 'm trying to uh go for my PhD Degree in Marketing .
So uh and the the issues uh included in the book was pretty interesting and um they looked at , uh I mean the writer looked uh the issues from different perspectives uh as far as uh different marketing strategies or the marketing survey and everything .
So um this uh made me uh wonder about the book .
