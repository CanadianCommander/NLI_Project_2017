The thing which I misses in home is uh without home is the uh food , which I 'm not able to enjoy here like uh um I 'm not able to uh eat properly because , the food here is different , entirely different from the what my mum used to prepare for me .
Other thing is uh my friends , there my friends who are always uh being there with me from the uh childhood and uh the environment wha - whatever it 's there uh and the things like my sister my brother and uh everyone and uh the place where I born that , that 's uh more necessary for me .
