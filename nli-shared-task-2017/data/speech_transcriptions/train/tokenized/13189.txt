When I miss home , what I miss most when I 'm away is probably my family and my friends .
Because for example when I go and I travel , well I do n't really mind about uh having less comforts or having bad experiences uh that can occur while you travel .
But there are friends or family members act , I usually shared moments with and this is what I 've missed most uh when I am away .
Not it 's , uh it 's not too difficult to bear because I 'm quite used to traveling or going away from home .
And so uh as long as that travel time is not too uh , too long while I , I 've learned how to deal with it .
