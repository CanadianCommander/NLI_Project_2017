Definitely English junior high school teacher because uh first reason is I like English and I want uh to teach English for the students .
And the second reason is uh when I think about uh uh money , teachers job is very uh uh fun to me because uh as a job is uh just work with computers or papers but teachers job is work is human and children .
So it must be very fun to me .
