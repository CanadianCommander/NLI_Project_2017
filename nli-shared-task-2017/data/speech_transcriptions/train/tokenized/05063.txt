I went to the United States last year and uh for studying one year in Wisconsin and when I was there , I had to prepare an exam for uh C plus plus programing class and at the exam , I had to study very hard because uh I never studied that that that subject before .
So I spend pretty much three hours each day for more than a week to prepare the the exam and it worked very good .
So I classify for the national tournament that I went and went there .
It was Tennessee and at the end I got the ninth place uh overall .
So I was really proud of myself .
