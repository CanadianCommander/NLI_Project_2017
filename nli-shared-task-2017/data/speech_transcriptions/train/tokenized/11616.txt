Well in my opinion the most important quality of a member in a team is he can understand leaders .
Why ?
Because I think first will understand us , he can combine members in the teams as a whole team .
Um mistakes I think the team can work together and to reach their aims i - much more easily .
And then when he can understand leaders , the leaders can do much more things , than command the members in team .
Of course this may also help the team to reach their aims easily , so I think the most important thing is to understand leaders .
