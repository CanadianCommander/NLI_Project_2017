Well what I miss most about my my city when I 'm away is uh basically my parent 's city in France .
Uh the city , not for itself but for the things it has so that when I go out and the other things like my old school and stuff .
Now that I 'm studying at the University of Nevada uh this is in the North of Spain and I live in Madrid .
So uh I will be here for like uh six years and well I 'll be back a couple of times for Christmas and whatever summer maybe and well I think I 'll missed maybe my parents and especially my friends which I 'll see less .
Some of them are you know United States or England , it does n't matter so I .
