When I 'm away in fact I miss a lot of different things in my house starting with objects and having your personal CDs and books and reading is always very good for your comfort , but also I 'm really miss my family more .
And then objects when I 'm away .
Um playing with my kids also I want them to feel homely and also to , to be able to see uh favorite uh TV shows and things like that .
A lot of different small things that makes you home .
Um also food can be different um aspect of what I 'm , I miss uh I really like to cook here .
I get at home sometimes when you , you 're away , you ca n't find the same taste and you feel alone .
