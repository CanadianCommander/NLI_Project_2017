When I 'm away from home , I really miss my family members everybody , my father , my mother and especially the home cooked food which I like very much , it 's taste and the one of salt and spice content .
When I eat in my college mess the food is really atrocious .
I really hate eating the same kind of food over and over and I really wish if I could go back home and eat the home cooked food which my mom prepares .
Uh I really like the food very much and uh about the food it has a special taste in it uh mom prepares it for me with love and uh that is the best thing about it .
That is what I miss most .
