I like to read novels .
Then there are many reasons behind this but I will explain two of them .
Firstly , the novels can take you away from the real life and experience emotions that you can never reach in real life .
Secondly , with reading novels you can learn to use your language in a more appropriate way and learn and to talk much more clearly .
