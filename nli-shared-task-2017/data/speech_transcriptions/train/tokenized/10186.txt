I 'm currently doing my masters program in womens studies program and my career objectives would be whether to stay in academia or uh going to teaching in higher education um it does n't have to be college but maybe in community college or high school uh levels or uh uh another option is that I could go uh into some NGO or some programs that um support women in with minority .
Um I choose to do so then it would more likely to be in a city area .
The reason I am doing this is because I have the sense of mission that women studies can really benefit to the society especially American society where women and minority it is useful to somehow achieve their own uh .
