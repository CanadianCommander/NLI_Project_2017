And it is really different from other any cities I think .
And that is why I 'm from it so , I would also suggest to go and Kyoto because they are one of the oldest cities , all these towns , cities in Japan , and has a lot of < % 39.9 > Japanese food and temples , < % 44.4 > it is really fun to visit .
