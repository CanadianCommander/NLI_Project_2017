The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was giving my MSAT exam .
Which would only my admission into a renounced institute if I faired well in the exam .
I found that , I found it very hard because it was the exam where I need to concentrate on depth of subjects like physics , chemistry and math and maths .
So I had to work for two long years to get the depth of these subjects that is my plus one and plus two .
So I find it the most precious accomplishment because it own my admission because it was the test that gave my admission to very good graduate school .
