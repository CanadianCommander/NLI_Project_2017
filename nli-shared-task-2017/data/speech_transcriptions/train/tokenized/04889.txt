An important opportunity with me was uh the opportunity to come to the United States of America when I was in High school .
It was an opportunity that provided me , allow me to visit a new country which I have never done before .
And also it was an opportunity pro - to pro improve my English in an environment where English is the primary speaking language .
And also more importantly it was an opportunity to experience a different culture and I was able to meet a lot of different people .
And through them I learned the importance of diversity and I learned how to understand other people who come from different cultures .
