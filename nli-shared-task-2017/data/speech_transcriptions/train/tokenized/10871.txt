Yes , if my friends from another country , were going to spend time in my country .
I prefer Alanya to visit there because Alanya is a historical place with museum and a big caste , Alanya Castle .
Alanya Castle had been um created on nineteen century and there is also Alanya lots of tourists from Russia , Germany and the north uh of Europe .
Once upon a time my friends from Australia , came to Alanya uh I visit them to Alanya .
They are proud and happy to be in Alanya .
The sea is very good and the town happy .
