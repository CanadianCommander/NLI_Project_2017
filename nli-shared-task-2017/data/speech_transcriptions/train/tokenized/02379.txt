I have when I was a medical stu - , medi - medical student because in the medical schools the subjects are very uh I mean many subjects and that take uh those subjects take me a lot of effort .
I have to work very hard and uh I have always , I , I , I always had to stay at night to study .
But it worth it because I want to be a good doctor and I need to have a uh a very good score to get into uh a medical center to be trained as a good doctor .
So uh that 's the , the best accomplishment that I have made .
