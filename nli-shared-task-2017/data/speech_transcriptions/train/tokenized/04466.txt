To me the best quality for someone who has to work in a team is the sense of respect because when you work in a team , if you respect people who work with you , there will be no problem and all the people will be he happy and very in a very work expe - experience .
And so when you respect people around you , it 's always more easy to come and work and it 's always more easy to establish some projects and all .
So for me it 's the best quality um .
