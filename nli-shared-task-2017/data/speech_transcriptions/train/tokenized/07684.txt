Uh I think that the most valuable quality for a person uh , for a me - , team member to have is willingness to do things or availability to , to do things , whatever he 's told to .
And two reasons why this is uh important is because with the willingness to doing things , you can always respond uh to whatever he 's asked you to do .
And on the other hand , you can always uh , adopt to whatever is needed or if , if there is any impromptu situation .
Uh that 's why the willingness to do things , whatever it is , it 's the best asset for a person to be , uh for a team member to have .
