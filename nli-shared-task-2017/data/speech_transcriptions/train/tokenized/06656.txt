One of the most interesting books I have ever read uh would be gone with the wind .
I really love that book .
One of the main reasons why enjoyed the book so much was that I got to know a lot of a lot of things about the history of America , that time about the American civil war , these are things that I did not have any information about before I read the book .
The other reason would be that I loved the main characters Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler .
I really enjoyed the love story in the book and um they would they would the way Scarlett 's character evolves from the beginning of the book is really interesting .
