The most important quality that I think that a valuable member of a team should have is team spirit and he should know the the team spirit is very important because I always believe in the saying that says that organization is much bigger than an individual .
So team is an organization and the goal of the team is should never be sacrificed for selfish reasons for a particular individual .
A team uh a particular individual should always devote all it 's all his uh abilities , all his qualities in the betterment of the uh team and not his individual prosperity , uh that the team should grow .
Uh this is why I think team spirit or splitting should is very important .
