An accomplishment that made me work really hard was to get to the entrance exam for my uh undergraduate college .
It was very uh hard task since the amount of competition involved was uh uh it was very very large .
Very large number of people competing for the less small amount of seats .
More than anything , the accomplishment was very important to me because it left me with this feeling of confidence that I could achieve anything that I could mi - mind too .
Uh this has helped me a lot since getting admission and has generally reflected in other uh pursuits in life as well .
The amount of hard work that went in certainly paid off in the end .
