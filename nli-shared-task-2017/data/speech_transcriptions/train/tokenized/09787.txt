Um when I 'm away from my home , uh , uh I miss most my family because uh it 's good to be with people around you ; uh family of people around you .
And I miss most my sister .
And other than that , I miss my dog uh because being with my dog is relaxing me .
And also I uh I miss the comfort in my home .
Because uh everything in my home is uh planned according to my needs .
And being away is making me feel a little bit uncomfortable .
