When I was sixteen years old I went to Switzerland to do my high school education .
It is a very special opportunity for me because it was an international school , I made a lot of friends because of that .
They 're all from different countries , have different cultures and speak different languages .
And um because I studying there so I had to speak French , English and S - and Spanish at the same time .
It really helped me a lot to prepare for my future and also because I studied there to practice my English I got a chance to come to United States to do my undergraduate study and that 's also one of the most important reasons that I can come to um this great country and study the great culture so I really appreciate the opportunity that I had .
