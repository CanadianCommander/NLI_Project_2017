I think the most important quality that someone needs to have on a team is responsibility .
Each uh each individual person is one , I mean is one with the team and if this person is n't responsible , this could lead to the team failure .
If so if some lets say someone does n't , it is a big important game and someone is n't responsible enough to come with uh to assist you to come to the game or even to not bring his stuff his spo - uh his sports clothes or anything , the team would be in a disadvantage because they wo n't have this member .
