I would uh advice my uh friends to visit my hometown um uh New Delhi .
Uh I would suggest them New Delhi because New Delhi is the capital city city of India .
This also this is the place where I have lived most of my life .
Also this is a very historic city and it has great places to visit like the Humayun 's Tomb , the uh the Presidents ' palace , etcetera etcetera .
Also it has people from all the uh states of India living in there .
Uh many things uh also influence this decision , Delhi has a great weather and great places to live in .
