I think the most special opportunity for me , is my parents let me come to the United States .
The purpose I come to the United States is uh I want to go to college .
I wish I can major in business in the college .
My goal is to be a , a financial manager in the future so I think this is the uh best opportunity for me to come to the United States .
If I can get the degree , and that will be really easy for me to get a good job in the future , and this really the special opportunity for me in all my life .
