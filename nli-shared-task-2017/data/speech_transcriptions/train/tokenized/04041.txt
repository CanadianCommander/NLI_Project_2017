A special opportunity that was given to me was to be an intern at the German Embassy in Washington .
This was very special for me because of different reasons .
Uh first uh , I was able uh to get in touch with new people of new uh country and that was very nice for me .
Uh in addition I was able to learn more about the culture of America and also about the culture of Germany .
And uh finally and maybe the most important thing I was able uh to built better relationship between the two countries because I was working at the embassy .
Thats why uh I , I was given this special opportunity uh at the embassy and I think this was very special for me .
