What I miss most about home when I 'm away is the safety and peacefulness that I get while I 'm at home .
I also miss my mum 's home cooked , home cooked food which I do n't get anywhere else .
Another thing about home is I do n't know it 's probably in our nature we feel a lot uh safe and secure in our home and I kind of miss that feeling of safety and security .
Uh a few other things I miss about home is the the locality I mean I have been used to the heat of Dubai and if I go to colder climates I start missing that it 's definitely what I miss about home .
