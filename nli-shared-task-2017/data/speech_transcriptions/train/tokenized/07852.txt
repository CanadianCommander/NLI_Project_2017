When I 'm away from home the things that I miss most about my home is my mothers love , my family food and the encouragement that I need when I 'm in dire stress or when I 'm in trouble .
One example that I can cite is that uh when my TOEFL test got canceled I needed encouragement from someone close who can actually encourage me and give me a boost .
At that point in time I missed the love and the affection and the encouragement I received from my family .
The other thing is food , I despise the food at the place I live so if I get good food I feel good .
And my home gives me the best food , these two things are the things that I miss the most .
