I think the most important quality for for someone in a group is communication skill .
Because uh of doing in a group where we need to communicate with with others and cooperate with other .
I f we do n't have this skill it 's easier for us to argue with all people .
And everybody knows team work is the important for cooperative with others then communication skills is very important .
Without this skill people could people could not uh work work together with others .
Then in the future it should have communications skill in the group .
