I like reading uh autobiographies of famous historic incidents and people because they help me to know about the psychology of human beings , the way great people have been able to construct their lives .
It also lays the foundation of human behavior .
I also like to read poetry of Shakespeare cause he really reaches to the depth of what human nature is exactly about .
So basically the reading material I 'm most interested in is the kind which tells us a lot about exactly how humans feel and how they react to situations .
Thank you .
