Really , I really do n't know how to read constantly so I , I take breaks for every half an hour .
So to do this I needed very , I needed to sit constantly in one place but very often I get up and take rest and to read in the later time .
So I think I need to take continuous reading that is the most thing that will make me to work hard more than .
