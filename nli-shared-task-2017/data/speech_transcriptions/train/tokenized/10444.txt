Well , the favorite book I have read is called Sacred Garden .
It is um about a little girl who actually lost her parents and had to beco - had to stay with the uncle who actually the the girl , takes care of her .
And she actually has several adventures there .
The reason I , I like this um book is because it act - the setting of it is a nature , that it , it has a garden , it has roses , it has how she actually interacts with nature .
That 's what I love the most .
But I can al - I can also , um except for that , also where the fantasy .
It has the secrecy about the secret door behind the rose bushes and the and a secret key .
And actually it might feel much childhood because it actually show me how I interact with , with nature and the friends .
