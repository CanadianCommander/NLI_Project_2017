Uh the , the interesting book I read is The Gulliver 's Travel .
The reason I say that , because the first of all I would like to say that I like travel a lot , much , so I l - I love traveling all around the world even in the undeveloped country .
Uh second is , I like challenging .
The Gulliver he , she , he went to pretty strange countries and meet many , you know , challenges and I like uh those to overcome the situation .
So that 's wh - that 's why I like this book a lot , uh much in , in entire my life .
