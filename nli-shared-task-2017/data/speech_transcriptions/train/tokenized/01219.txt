I think patience is an important quality in a person that makes him or her a valuable member of a team .
I think so because uh patience is what increases uh a feeling of team 's spirit among people who are related in uh to the team and who are expected to work together in the team .
So if someone commits a mistake or if two people have differences in their ideas or thoughts or plans , they have to be patient and listen to the others and be able to make uh the right kind of decisions and the right kind of moves so that uh the and the team will benefit .
