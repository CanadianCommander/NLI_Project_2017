I think that uh in the team it 's important for a person to be able to play with other people .
So um in the team you has to play with each other you can be personal and you has to do everything for your team .
Um the team is by participating with the team this way , this way the the way how you can win a game .
If you do n't play that way then it wo n't work .
So that 's the reason I think that being a personal and being and sharing uh with other people is the most important credibility in a team .
So that 's it .
