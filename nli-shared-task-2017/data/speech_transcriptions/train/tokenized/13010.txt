Well I recently read The Da Vinci Code .
It 's a very interesting book because well it 's a controversial topic and it has uh main everyone talk about it .
They church uh people who do n't believe in God and and all that .
Uh so so I really read uh it has been a book that uh has changed many peoples view of of certain aspects of religion .
Also I I liked it because it gives you historical facts .
Some of them are not true , some of them are .
Uh and this historical .
