Recently I have read a book uh called Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain .
In this book I have like very much .
This book is quite interesting because the author very nicely describes the attitude of a boy of going school going age who is very reluctant to go school .
Instead he enjoys the to play around with his friends .
He this boy uh is uh known as Tom , uh he has no parents but his her his aunt guides him , always calls him for not doing his work properly .
I think this book clearly describes the life of a school going boy and I liked it very much .
