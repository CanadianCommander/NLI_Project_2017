Special opportunity that was given to me was by my dad .
My dad let us go to United States and study English .
It is very special to me because not many people get to go to other country to study and live there .
Many of Japanese , all my friends always wanted to go to United States to study and live and experience what 's it like to live in United States .
And that is why I I think it is a special opportunity .
