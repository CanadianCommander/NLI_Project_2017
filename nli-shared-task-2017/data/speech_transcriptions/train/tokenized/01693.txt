The book named Life of inspired me a lot .
I have read this book so many times .
This book was written by .
The reason why I like this book the most because of the way the presentation of this book .
The entire life of is mentioned in this .
The way he grew up as a king , the con - the consequences that led him to leave the kingdom and to become a saint .
The presentation on this is fine .
