If I have friends from other country who wish to come to India and see the places I would suggest him to go to Agra .
Agra is a place where there 's Taj Mahal .
Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world it is a beautiful ethnic glory of modern times .
Later I would suggest him to go to Rajasthan , Rajasthan is a place of and glorific palaces over there palaces in Audipur which is being built between in , in between the lake to approach that we are supposed to go by boat .
And the carvings and the other ethical and properly shown features of Indian beauty have been portrayed over there .
