Friends from another country would come to visit me in my country , I would show them the city of Cologne because I think it 's representing uh our country very well .
It has this nice old part of the town um and also the modern parts a town or a big city needs to have .
Um there are many many possibilities to spend the evenings , for example going to disco um and there are also many possibilities to see cultural things like uh the dome and Cologne and to visit museums so they have uh large , they have many opportunities and they can choose what they want to see .
