The most important thing I miss when I 'm away from is the food is food which prepared by my mother .
The most important thing about the food is it has high nutrition value as compared to the food which we get outside in restaurants which moves us to a bad health and things like that .
And the other thing is the cost which is to be paid at restaurant .
At home you will not worry about the cost , about the money , about the pocket money we get to spend .
So it 's not uh the primary concern is the cost of the food .
So it is also a factor .
And the other thing is the taste of the food .
Obviously food prepared by mother is the best food one can ever taste .
