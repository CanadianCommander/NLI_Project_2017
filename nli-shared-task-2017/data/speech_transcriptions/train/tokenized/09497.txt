I prefer to read novels in my free time .
I like to read novels because there 's such a happy ending and also there are , a very a uh there is different types of characters that you can see portrayed in different kinds of novels .
So the story does n't get old .
Uh like the other day I was reading a novel and uh it was a happy love story and uh it also ended really nicely .
So it sort of gives you the feeling that here is sort of a happy ending in the world which may not be portrayed in that time of your life but it is nice to read about it .
