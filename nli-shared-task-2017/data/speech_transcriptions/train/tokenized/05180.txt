I think I have the experience that when you come to a broad to a foreign country , and as I term uh the things I miss the most is the food .
Uh because Chinese food is very delicious and in my home town Beijing uh it 's price is not very high .
And I always enjoy this delicious food with my family and my friends .
I think uh this uh eating this food in the restaurant can make my family more closer .
And make my friendship and make me I and my friend I will spend the really relaxing time and happy time , so uh in a foreing country because the food is not so uh suitable for me and maybe too uh , uh too fat and it make me become fatter .
