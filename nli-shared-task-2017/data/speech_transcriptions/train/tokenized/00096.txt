I would like to work in banking general and finance because , someone told me once that in institutions that deal with money or handle accounts and so on , it 's easiest to make a lot of money .
And this is proving true because the salary level at like banks or insurance companies or investment banks are among the highest uh in each sector when you compare each sector to each other .
And uh the career opportunities are very diverse .
So you can work in the financial centers of the world which mostly being in big cities and uh you have a very good income level .
