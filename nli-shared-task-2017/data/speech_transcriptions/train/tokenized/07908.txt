I want to be involved in just uh in NGOs which is specifically pretty much based on financial matters because since I was studying um sociology and economics um in university um I hope that I contribute um in some ways to some people that 's some poor people especially in South East Asia and Africa and with financial matters financial means I want to contribute um some housing where lives and we have quality of life .
So that 's what I want to be and that 's what I want to do .
