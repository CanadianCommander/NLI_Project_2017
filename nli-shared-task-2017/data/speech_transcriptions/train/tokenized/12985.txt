I 'm thinking of applying for the program in Baltic in the TSUF .
So the biggest opportunity and the special opportunity that was given to me was to meet the lab members there in the department where I was applying .
It was a big opportunity for me because uh in that way I can have interaction with the people of the lab that are currently working .
So in that way that would help me in having a better relationship in the future if I 'm going to join that lab .
This opportunity was really important as this helped me in taking admission in that university as I came across the scientist who is uh the board at lab to talk about the result interest .
