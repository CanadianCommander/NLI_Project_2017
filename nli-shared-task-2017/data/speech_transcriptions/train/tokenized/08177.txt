I would tell them to go to Cologne because I think it 's one of the greatest cities in Germany .
It 's vibrant and charming .
There are lots of clubs and museums .
That 's a lot of culture to see and on the second then would be that it has really cu - historical um site as well .
You could go to the Schn√ºtgen Museum for example with them or go and visit the Dome of Cologne .
