I mostly miss my mom , is the loving person in the world and I ca n't live without her .
I miss all the things my mom make and all the things my mom do .
I miss her affection , I ca n't even stay without her for a day .
Uh when I when I leave this place , she 's the only one who thinks all the time about me so even the same with me , I just think always about her wherever I go and I love her so much , so I ca n't miss a thing .
I never go out , I generally go out taking any uh some of the things where which remind my and which which feels me make my mom is with me .
This is the basic thing I generally miss and I just ca n't leave this and I love my mom .
