A quality I think that makes someone a valuable member of a team is to sensitive and nice and you have leadership , because if you are sensitive , you know what people wants and what they likes .
And uh secondly , if you 're nice people will like you , because if you 're mean , people does , do n't like then you 're not a good member of a team .
And you should have a leadership in order to be important member to a team , because if you lead and the team follows you , it 'll be valuable member of your team .
