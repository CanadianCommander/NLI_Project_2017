I think I 'd choose the job of a veterinarian and this is exactly what I always wanted to do , and what I would always choose again .
The reason for that is that I always wanted to work with animals since I have been six years old , that was the goal I had .
And uh that is the first step um I reach that and hope I can work with animals .
I think is a job where you can choose a lot of different ways , you can work with different kind of animals of course , but you can always work as , as in different countries as , as I do now .
And you can work um in totally different areas .
You can do research and um you can help people if you go to third um to development countries , and so I think it 's a great job I would love to do .
