From my experience uh back in the year , I miss the , my family most .
Um because I , I 've got parents over there uh in Canada and they spend their time with their family and I , I could join with them .
But I felt lonely because they , they looked like , they seemed like very good family .
And uh it reminds me of my family .
I realized my , my mother 's love and my father 's .
And how important my sisters .
So that 's the reason .
