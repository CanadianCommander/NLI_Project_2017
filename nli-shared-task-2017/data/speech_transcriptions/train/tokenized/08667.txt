A very interesting book I 've read is The Songlines by Bruce Chatwin .
Uh it 's very interesting to me because it narrates about um uh customs of the upper regions of Australia and I 'm very interesting uh this matter .
And for examples , he speaks about the historical uh the hi - hi - historical uh uses of this populations and in general , uh the of the book is to investigate on why man uh likes to travel .
That is one of the main points of Chatwin literature .
