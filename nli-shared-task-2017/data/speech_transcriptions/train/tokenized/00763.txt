Because obviously the most interesting place for country is the capital , is a big city , it has a lot of possibilities what you can do .
And you can go to museums , you see a lot about the history of Germany , the part of Germany , um there were other things , a lot of good night-life Berlin .
So I think that will be my first choice to tell somebody who will visit Germany who will visit Germany to go to Berlin .
And also um from Berlin , I mean you can go to and visit the castles around < % 40.2 > , show you picture of Germany history .
