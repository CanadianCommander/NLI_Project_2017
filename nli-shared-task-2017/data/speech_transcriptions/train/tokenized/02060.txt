I think that there are two uh important character characteristics of fairness and um that a person is reliable .
First of all I think that fairness is important because um if you 're on a team you have to um the well the members have to be fair because otherwise , you ca n't trust them um so this very important .
And secondly , I think that um the persons in a team have to be reliable because if you work together um you have to rely on the persons .
For example , when you have to um write a paper and about and you ca n't rely on information given by other mem - team members .
Um uh this wo n't work out I think and that 's why the support .
