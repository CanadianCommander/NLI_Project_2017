I have one of the most important opportunity in my life when I won the lottery to have my green card and come to the United States .
I think is they give the opportunity to study in this one of the biggest in the world and the richest country and in the United States also that is one of the country where you can live your dream and you can become what you really want to do , if you work hard and also with my green card I can have um an opportunity to have financial aid if I do n't have money .
I can go to every school I want to go , I can do everything an American pe - person can do in the United States so I 'm very thankful
