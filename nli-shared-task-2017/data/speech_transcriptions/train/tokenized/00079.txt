I think tolerance is the main quality that you must possess .
As a member of a team because it requires a lot to be a team .
A lot of hard work so you need tolerance to listen to what I said , act on what it is given and perform the task that you are given .
It also shows the additional qualities like adjustment and also patience that you have with the members as well as give in .
So I think tolerance is a uh is a virtue that every team member , maybe valuable or not so valuable should posses so as to become uh uh so as to become uh so as to keep up the team spirit .
