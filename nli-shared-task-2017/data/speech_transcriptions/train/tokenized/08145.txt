When uh friends of mine come to visit my country here in Germany , so in general I 'm not a native German I 'm , I 'm coming originally from Turkey .
I think uh so I suggest they would visit Tambach this is the town I stay because of the fact that there is the it is a wonderful place where you can take a walk and there is also the kits where you can see a lot of uh things , for example uh there is a lot of life .
Then uh another city is Cologne , Cologne is very uh very um very , very cool city where you can have a lot of night life .
