I think the most um the most I miss when I 'm away is my family especially my little brother .
Uh we 're really close friends and I can talk to him about everything and we just we can we can sit down and talk and just be there for each other and when I 'm away , I really miss it because I talk to him via via email and I talk to via because I ca n't see him and I ca n't see his face and it 's really hard .
Another another thing I really miss about home is like the smell of my of the of my flower or the smell of the food which is so typical for Austria or the smell of the flowers and the trees and everything .
