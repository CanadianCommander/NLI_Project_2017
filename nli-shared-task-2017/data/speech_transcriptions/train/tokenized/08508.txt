I 'm going to talk about Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell .
Uh that was one of the most interesting books I 've ever read because it mentioned about things which I started to see happening around my environment the times that I was n't there or things which were most likely to happen in the world we live in today .
I was also able to relate it to one of my favorite movies , V for Vendetta and I just thought that the things mentioned there were very realistic and also very sad .
So this is why I thought this book was interesting .
