Well the interesting book that I 've read about is microeco - The Principles of Microeconomics .
Uh was interesting for me because in my life there are many things that I did n't know about and this book helped me to clarify these things as and stuff about how people communicate with each other , how countries work with each other to maintain this world and help each other .
And about examples like in national trade between two countries and uh stuff about investments and banks and how welfare works and how uh sometimes politics effect economy , that 's all .
