Well I like to read a lot in my leisure time so I like to read magazines and novels as well .
I do n't like to read poetries that much because it 's only like heavy and feels like sitting in high school again .
But I love magazines because they 're like easy to read and it 's fun to read them and I would like books also because um they 're so many stories so many different things that stands on books .
Like well maybe love stories , I like them a lot or well I 'm mature I just like to read at all that 's fun .
