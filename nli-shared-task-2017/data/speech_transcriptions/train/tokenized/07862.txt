Well that 's the thing that we miss most when I 'm away from my home is that my family members .
Well actually I got like others a father and my mom and my two little brothers .
I love them so much and sometimes when I got home we 'll talk about something that happened uh , on campus or at school .
So when actually someday that I went abroad for further studying I think that I will miss some special time that I spend doing with all my family .
