So what I miss when I 'm away from home , definitely there are many things which I miss but one of them most important thing is the food made my my mom , my mother .
The cook , way she cooks has got a different taste , a different taste and that 's that is which I miss the most , I can not find that taste in food when I 'm outside , when I eat at restaurants when I eat in some cafeteria .
I can demand what I want there and my demands are fulfilled but when I 'm in a hostel I have to eat what the cook what the cook has prepared in the mess for all of the students for all of the colleagues .
So one of the most important thing which I miss is mom 's my mom 's mother 's meal food .
