Well when I 'm not home I miss sort of things .
For example there is my pet animals which I like a lot and which I miss of course .
Then there is my family which I talk a lot to and when we talk about topics that appear and now I ca n't do that , so I miss them too .
Another thing I really miss would be personal belongings , for example things in my cardboard , things that I watch on television which might appear now in a different language and yeah , just other things that belong to me and which I ca n't take with me .
Then there are other things too for example there is a computer which you have .
