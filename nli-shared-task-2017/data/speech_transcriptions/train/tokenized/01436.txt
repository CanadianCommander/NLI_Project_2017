If I could have any job or career I wanted , I would choose to be an astronaut .
I find it fascinating to explore new worlds and particularly to experience being exposed to zero gravity environment uh zero gravity environment and being able to to reach places few people in the world have been able to be there .
I also find it fascinating to be able to tell and and share this experience with other people um um particularly children so as to encourage them to follow careers such as these .
