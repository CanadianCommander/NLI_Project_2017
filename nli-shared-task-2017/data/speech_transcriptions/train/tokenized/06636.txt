I was working for a Japanese airline which is called Japan Airlines and that was really hard work , because we had long flights and it was physically very exhausting .
We had to learn Japanese and work with the Japanese crew .
But was really important to me to make that experience because it is it was really multi-cultural and also see a lot of countries and get to know a lot of people especially the Chinese culture and mentality .
And as well not being the university and only school I wanted to make other experiences although work was really hard .
