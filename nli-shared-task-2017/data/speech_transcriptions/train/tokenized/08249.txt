I enjoy uh reading novels very much , one of my favorite um authors is Garcia Marquez um basically I love reading um his novels because it lets my imagination run free .
I just put myself to where the novel takes place and not only that I have the chance to re-read the novel again and go back to the um lovely places that the novel talks about .
Describing different things , different topics , descriptions of people , places .
Um he writes a lot of uh fiction so um that 's nice too .
I also like reading about magazines , I have to choose them so like those basically uh who magazines where I can uh get little tips on how to behave and how to handle difficult situation with children .
