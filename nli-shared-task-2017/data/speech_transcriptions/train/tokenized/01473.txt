Material that I like to read a lot is magazines .
This is because it talks a lot about the current things happening all over the world .
They are interesting things which I had not , which I would probably which I have not known earlier on even if I even if I did know about them , uh it probably go a little bit more details .
This is very nice concept of magazines because it helps people all over the world to know what 's going on at other places in the world .
Um it brings on amazing and wonderful details which probably one can not find out else in any other manner possible apart from Internet .
I also enjoy reading novels because it tells me how I can be creative and how people think and how they can imagine characters and put them in real life story .
I believe these two are very good to pass time .
