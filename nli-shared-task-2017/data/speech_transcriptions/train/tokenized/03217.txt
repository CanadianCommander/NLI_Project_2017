The interesting book I read , I have read uh is the Tale of Two Cities .
Uh I think it was interesting because uh it talks about uh and , a century that we were n't there .
And it talks about a good experience .
And it shows uh how where people were living uh in the past .
And what was uh , what was control them .
Uh for example choosing people that did n't uh have enough things and enough responsible to do everything .
And the were four people which they were responsible .
