An accom - uh accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh during uh my s - l - last year of secondary um exams .
I worked very hard ` cause uh , because uh I did n't do so well the first time and I had to um higher my grade so I can uh travel abroad and finish studying um and choose a major that I would want to study .
Um so I worked really hard and I improved my s - my score um .
