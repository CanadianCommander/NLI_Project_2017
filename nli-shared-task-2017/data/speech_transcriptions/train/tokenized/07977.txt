An interesting , an interesting book I 've read is The World is is Flat by Mr. Friedman .
This book about the consequences of the globalization of the world economy .
It uh it illustrates what effects does the globalization have about the variety in the different countries for uh the uh the process of globalization .
The uh big variety between different countries um exist concerning the the culture , the way you lived but because of globalization , everything gets more similar , which I think is a very interesting process and uh real deal uh have to deal with that .
