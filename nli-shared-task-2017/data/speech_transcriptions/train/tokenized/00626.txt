If I had the option to choose my career or the job um in my dreams um that I want to do uh for the rest of my life I would definitely choose to be a marine biologist .
And the main uh reason for that is I have a huge passion about uh about sea creatures and the seas of the world , oceans .
Um I 'm from the Mediterranean , I 'm from the island of Cyprus so I have always been at the beach during my summertime .
Spent my summers at the beach most of the time with my family and I had the time to explore a lot of the uh sea animals such as the sea stars , crabs .
