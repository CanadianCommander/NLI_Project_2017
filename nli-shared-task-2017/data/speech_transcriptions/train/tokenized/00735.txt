That is uh because we do n't we we always use a lot of different frames that can change our view of the world we we use a lot of our uh ideas of our uh ways to to think the reality is that that actually is not .
There are in the book a lot of examples where two different groups of study to people in a lot of in those experiments are actually put and uh they are asked to to to think about one uh particular factor and they they give it some irrational answers to to those answers irrational answers yeah to .
