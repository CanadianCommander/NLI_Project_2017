I 'm quite used to the situation being at home for quite a long time since I started studying at a university which is not in my hometown .
The things I probably miss the most are of course my family which support me in every way they can and the support is something that I really miss and my dogs are always around me with whom I can go for a walk and just be myself and relax and of course my friends that I can hang out with that I have um fun with and uh the most of my friends probably my girlfriend .
Um I spend a lot of time with her and every time I have to leave to go to university I um really miss her and I ca n't wait to see her and my other family members again .
