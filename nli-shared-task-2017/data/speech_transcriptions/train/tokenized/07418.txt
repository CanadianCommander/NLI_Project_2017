An interesting book that I read recently was , was Stiff Upper Lip , Jeeves by boo - , by P. G. Wodehouse .
It was a really funny book .
Basically it describes the incidents uh in the life of an individual whose name is Bertram Wooster .
Bertram Wooster in life and he gets into a lot of tight situations .
The way he retrieves himself with the help of his gentleman 's gentleman who is Jeeves creates a compelling and humorous incident which makes a good reading .
The best part about Wodehouse is that he ignores real life altogether and just makes a funny scenario which uh elevates the enjoyment that one can derive reading the book .
