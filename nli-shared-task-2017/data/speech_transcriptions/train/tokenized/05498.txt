The book I want to talk about is The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman that is uh journalist uh American journalist .
And he speaks about about uh how digitization is affecting this twenty forth century .
And this is really interesting to me because I 'm already interesting in politics and I hope politics and economics uh works together in the globalization .
And this relieves uh new perspective on the higher subject .
Also is very clever guy and so he says many I 've never thought about .
So I think this a really really interesting book is worth reading for everyone who is interested in politics .
