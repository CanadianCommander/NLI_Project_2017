I think to be communicative is a very value of value of the um quality of a member of a group .
I think uh if a person is communicative , he or she can express his feelings , can uh coordinate the group members and can ask questions if there are come up questions so uh it makes a whole group uh speaking together and uh doing spe - spe - to the problems that can come up and the questions .
Uh whole group can be uh more successful and uh they can work closer as a team .
