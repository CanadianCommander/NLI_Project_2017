An interesting book I read recently was Shantaram written by Gregory David Robert .
Uh it 's uh partly erupted from his true life story .
Uh the most interesting thing about the story is for me especially was that it covers India .
Uh his who escapes to India from Australia and leads in a very eventful life for around fifteen years in India .
Uh the tells me how you must adopt and learn from different things in life , live life to the fullest and also enjoy whatever may come to the life come to your life uh whether it 's good or even if it 's bad .
That 's why I like it .
