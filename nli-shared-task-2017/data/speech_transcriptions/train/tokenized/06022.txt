I 'm going to talk about Memories of a Geisha .
I chose this book because I thought that it was really interesting because uh you can learn about a different culture and you can also like see how a woman do like change all his life just for love life .
How she became a geisha just because she wants to be with the German .
So it 's really interesting to know about that like um like all the steps they have to make they have met with the woman and also to see that to to be a geisha is not like pro - it 's like prostitution but it 's not as more about art , so .
