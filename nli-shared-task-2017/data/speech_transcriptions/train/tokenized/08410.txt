When I 'm away from my home I miss my mom the most and uh because she is my best friend as well and I miss her because uh she used to cook a lot of things for me and I and I like eating a lot a different kind of things and she used to cook different things for me .
And the second reason why I like miss my mom too much is the she was my friend .
I was able to talk to her anything I wanted , I could have shared with her anything and uh that 's why I miss my mom a lot when I 'm not away not at my home .
