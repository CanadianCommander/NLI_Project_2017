Last summer I was given the special opportunity from my university to go to summer practice school in Switzerland .
This was very important for academic studies because I had the chance to study with a professor in Switzerland .
I learned various topics which strengthened my academic make up .
Moreover , they paid me a good amount of money and this improved my economic condition greatly .
And on my major return I had the chance to visit many European countries which was also very relaxing after the two months of heavy , heavy load with work .
This was a very special opportunity and it has been very important and good for me .
