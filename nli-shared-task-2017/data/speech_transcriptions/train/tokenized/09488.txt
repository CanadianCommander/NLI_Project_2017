What I miss more about my home when I 'm away is that I miss the food my mom makes really delicious food .
I miss all the homemade cakes , burgers and stuff and affection .
The affection which I share with my mom , dad , my brothers and my family members that 's just great .
It 's something which you ca n't get anywhere , you ca n't uh , this thing wo n't repeat again .
And the fights I miss all my fights with my brother , the way we fight the way he pulls my hair the way I irritate him the way I just , the way I I miss all that affection , all that love it 's really , it 's really bad to miss all this stuff
