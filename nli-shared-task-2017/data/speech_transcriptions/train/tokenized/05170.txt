The most interesting book for me is the baseball book about .
I have two reason for this , first off was a great baseball player in Japan .
They have a lo - great reputation in Japan .
And next , he gain uh reputation in America too .
Now he is playing baseball in major league .
And the , he was average hitter in the major league and won a lot of praise and made a lot of record in there .
