Hi I would choose someone , to , to think someone valuable member of a team is his or her value skills , because there are a couple of things involved .
One of the thing is his writing skills and other thing is um speaking skills .
Because these two , these two , these two quality shows uh how he could express himself uh in the team so that uh the team members would influence from him .
Uh and how the other thing is uh important quality for the team or group to , member to have is that being able to .
