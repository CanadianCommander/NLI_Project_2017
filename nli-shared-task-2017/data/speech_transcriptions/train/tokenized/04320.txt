My interesting book I 've read is Japanese uh novel that is called .
This is the story about a ninja .
A ninja tried to kill a shogun and there are , uh there are a lots of action of ninjas but he finally succeed to reach shogun but he did n't kill shogun because uh uh he felt he , this shogun was just a normal man so he did n't kill this .
So this kind of action and the way of thought are really fascinated me .
That 's very interesting .
