My biggets accomplishment has been my double degree which I studied engineering and business administration in Australia in Melbourne .
This was very hard because I had to go there when I was uh eighteen years and I was very alienate , I did n't want even there .
I had to live and go on for my studies .
And I did n't have any friends and I had to make , meet new people and this was a completely new culture for me and adapting to time .
And it was very hard for me to survive in the start but as time passed by , I learn how to and then I completed my five years degree in a very , in a very accomplished way and I 'm very happy about it .
