The book which is uh very interesting which I read uh , lately is The Alchemist .
Alchemist is written by Paulo Coelho .
Uh the book is about dreams , how a person uh dreams about something and how those dreams become a reality .
So it encourages , it motivates people uh to dream .
And uh it has a theory uh but says that if , if uh the whole world would conspire to uh , to complete your dream .
So uh , it is , it 's very uh , motivational book and it inspires people to dream and uh to get into uh , to do what they uh feel is correct .
