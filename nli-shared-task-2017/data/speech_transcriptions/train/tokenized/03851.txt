One special opportunity that was given to me was when I had the chance to meet Prince Charles .
I had the chance to talk to him for about , well one hour and it was interesting to me the person who , whom one can read and and see so many uh facts about um he was totally different than I imagined .
He was very kind , very calm and he was very interested in in the things I had to say and my opinion and for me it was very important to to understand that one should always try to to see behind the the mask that a person is wearing or forced to be , to wear .
