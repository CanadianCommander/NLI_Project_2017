Well an accomplishment I 'm really proud of is that I uh went one year in , I went to a country that I 've been studying for one year , it 's been a wonderful experience help me learning a language most of all culture .
I 've been traveling around quite a lot and help me uh to evaluate how much I love my home Italy and especially my little city in Sardinia and that 's an experience I would suggest to anyone because it 's really full of really good things to learn .
