I think one of the main uh qualities that a valuable member of a team should have I think is good attitude .
Uh good attitude spreads uh throughout the team uh when somebody has good attitude motivates people make them feel good it is good work environment , uh he is always ready you know that person that has good attitude always likes to cooperate and uh and and motivates still other people to do the same .
So good attitude leads other people to be good leaders , also achieve the goals and keep uh good work environment and have a good time and while they work .
