I recently read uh Sirens of Titans by Kurt Vonnegut and it 's a really interesting book .
Uh it 's um could be classified under science and fiction but I would n't call this fiction novel .
Uh it 's uh is mainly a satirical novel and uh it 's for me main concerns the read and the uh issues in the human society .
For instance there is a guy that uh goes to Mars and builds an army of human in Mars and attacks the world and uh I I think uh this is a representation of uh humans uh in the control .
