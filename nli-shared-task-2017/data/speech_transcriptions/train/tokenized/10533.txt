I was read uh an autobiography on a man named Richard Branson and I just realized that you can still fulfill your dreams even though you have nothing and you , you know you , you born with nothing .
And you drop out of school and stuff .
Like that 's not what you 're supposed to do but if you have the right will power and you know you plan ahead and everything , uh I think you can still do what you want to do , given your head on , head strong and you want to do what you can do .
It 's a very entertaining book as well .
It 's quite funny .
