If I were to recommend um any places um in my country to visit to my friends would be um the capital city because there are excellent restaurants you go and dine at with different um other nationalities actually and the city life is uh composed of uh clubs and bars and just um < % > and um < % > bar cafes that 's that 's what they 're called and there 's just a great time to spend .
Or also another city called Cartagena which is in the coast line which is a lot warmer , um a lot more carribean , great food , great sea food .
Um the atmosphere is just one a lot um parting .
Just music all around .
