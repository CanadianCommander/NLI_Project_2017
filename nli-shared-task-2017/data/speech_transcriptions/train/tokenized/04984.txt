Uh the special opportunity that I was given uh was uh when I finished uh the school , I went to Canada to learn English .
And this opportunity was important for me because uh there I was alone .
And also , uh it helped , that opportunity helped me to know more about myself being without my family .
Also the opportunity to know another city and another culture .
