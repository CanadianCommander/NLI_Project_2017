In my life I prefer to read any of the these things , novels , magazines and poetry but especially in spare times I prefer to read magazines because these magazines I can learn the latest uh news about my country , my local state or < % > or of all over the world .
For this reason , every morning I read magazines and in the other spare times I prefer the read novels especially at night before going to bed , I read about the history or something .
Sometimes but not always I read poetry .
