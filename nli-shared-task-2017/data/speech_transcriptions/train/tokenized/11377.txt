A quality that makes somebody a valuable member of a team I think is hard work .
A person who is hard working can finish the work in time and even put an extra uh which are necessary for to for the project to be finished or any other type of uh work to be done .
I think this an important quality for team because without hard work no nothing can be achieved .
And hard work builds the basis for a strong and and in a good team .
A team which ha - a team which is which does not uh support hard work is is very is a very secondary team and can not possibly achieve to finish anything on time .
It is without a doubt a very bad team .
