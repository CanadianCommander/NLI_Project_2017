For me it was a special opportunity to go to South Africa for an internship in two thousand and five , it was nearly Cape town .
I worked in a clothing , clothing factory and it was a special opportunity for me because it was my first time in an English speaking country .
And I uh spend a lot of time in the company and I was able to learn uh Business English and um I met uh English business man , English business Woman and uh the English business culture .
And so it was it a special time for me .
