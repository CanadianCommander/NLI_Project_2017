I had a chance to go to Mongolia instead of my military service in two thousand .
It was a great opportunity because to live in a foreign country as a physician was a great chance to meet different peoples and it was a very great opportunity to learn foreign language including Mongolians and some Russians and also English .
I enjoyed the period very much .
