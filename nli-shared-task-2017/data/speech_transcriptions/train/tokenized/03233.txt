Uh friends from a different country come to visit my country which is Luxembourg , I would suggest that they visit the capital , which is called Luxembourg city .
Because it 's a very unique city , it 's an old city , it has a lot of fortification that can be visited and it has a nice city centre .
You can actually take a hop on , hop off bus tour through Luxembourg , which is really nice .
It 's a little bit expensive , it cost about fifteen Euro per person but I think it 's worth it because you really get to see the whole city and you get to see the European institutions which are in different part of the city , you ca n't just walk there so the bus takes you there .
And I think this is a nice tour which shows you whole Luxembourg .
