As a student majoring in economics I think uh interesting book for me is An Inquiry Into the Nature and the Causes of the Wealth of Nations written by Adam Smith .
This remark book was published in seventeen seventy six .
In this book , Adam Smith write against the restrictive , regulated and uh which entirely is the system .
And told me , told us how the principle of competition and that just expose economic development and uh reduce poverty .
This book changed our understanding of the economic work so I think it 's an interesting book for me to read .
