The special opportunity that was given to me is the opportunity that uh I can live abroad and study in Canada .
And the reason is uh because because uh I can improve my English and um start to live independently here in Canada .
Um I can improve my English because now I 'm living in an English environment country which I will speak English everyday instead of my mother language .
So that I can improve my English skills and so that I can attend um or go to some famous English universities .
And independ - living independently can also help me uh with my situation here to be organized .
