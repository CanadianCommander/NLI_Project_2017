When outside from home is usually like I miss a lot of my my family .
I miss my family the most especially like my sister with whom I talk the most .
When I 'm away from home like when I was in Los Angeles for one year , I missed a lot like the places I 'm used to like the places I used to go in my home city .
Like uh like the square , like the city center and a lot of places where , where I have a lot of memories .
I miss also a lot of my habits that interconnected to these places like going on trips .
