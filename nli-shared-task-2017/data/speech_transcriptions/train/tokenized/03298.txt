Um one valuable quality of a team member I can think of is uh a person needs to be well organized uh because if a person is organized , he can get things done at a time .
Um you cam have all your work completed within the time .
You are completely organized so you do not miss out on any things .
Uh you work , you complete within the time .
Um uh organized people they are very well um uh they are very well organized and they do things appropriately .
Uh they uh they can do things better than the others , they can plan very well systematically .
So it 's good .
