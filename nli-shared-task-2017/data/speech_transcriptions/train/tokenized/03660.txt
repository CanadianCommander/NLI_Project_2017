Somebody is a good team player if he develops tolerance .
Uh by tolerance , I mean uh not only the team should be able to accept that nobody is perfect but also uh be able to see that uh he can can teach and bring a lot of uh his qualities to other persons in the team .
I believe uh tolerance is also important in the fact that the team may lose due to another team member .
So it 's important to accept this as being part of playing in a team .
