The most thing I miss about when I 'm far away from my home is um my parents of course .
Right now , I 'm I 'm I 'm staying at a dormitory but I always eat food from outside and then I miss the food which my my mom cooks for me and the laundry .
I 'm the one who always washes and I also miss my pets .
