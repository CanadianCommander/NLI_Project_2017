If someone is visiting my country Japan , I would suggest them to visit Kyoto which is a very old city , and has a tons of temples and really good places to site seeing .
Um also I would suggest they visit um maybe Okinawa which is uh Island located in South , which is really nice place and has a tons of great food and people are very nice .
They 'd probably see very different uh aspect of Japan , different from what they are are expect for like very big city .
