As a child I really enjoyed reading fiction but now I spent most of the time reading newspapers and magazines .
These are very important , these are these I enjoy most because newspapers and magazines help me increase my awareness uh about what 's happening in the world and and keeps me update about keeps me updated about what all is happening and uh um and to be able to uh talk about the recent current happenings in the world with other people .
Like there are so many num - numerous conversations that they have to indulge in at work place , with friends here and there all the time .
So uh reading newspapers and magazines not only helps me spend my time in really constructive way .
