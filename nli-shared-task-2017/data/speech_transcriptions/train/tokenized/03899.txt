An interesting topic , the book which I have read is The Doomsday Conspiracy by Sydney Sheldon .
I really love reading this book because it connects me with lot of adventure and excitement .
It 's a thriller book which I generally prefer reading .
That 's why Sydney Sheldon 's Doomsday Conspiracy invokes a feeling of thrill and excitement all along the whole novel .
This is the best book which I ever read till date .
Thank you .
