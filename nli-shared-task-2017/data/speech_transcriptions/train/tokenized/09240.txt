I consider Bahrain my home as I moved to Kuwait about two years ago .
Um the the thing I miss most about Bahrain is the fact that my friends and family are there , or most of my family .
Um I used to go out a lot with my friends and I never used to , since I do n't have school in Bahrain I study in Kuwait , I never had a lot of work to do in Bahrain so I used to have a lot of free time .
And during my free time I would go out I would run a lot and I would read I do n't have time to do my hobbies in Kuwait as I as I have to study all the time .
