Out of novels , magazines and poetry I mostly prefer to read novels in my free time .
I do prefer novels most because a novel gives you good opportunity to um discover something new about another persons life or another culture or just to discover the story essence .
Um for example a novel lays out the development of a character where even certain characters dream certain development period .
Um a novel also as in enough time and enough base to describe detail of the characters development in contrast on magazine and article .
