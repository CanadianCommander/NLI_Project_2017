Well when I am away from my home , I missed I missed is my parents because when I 'm in um when I 'm at home I was uh carefully cared by my parents and they take me to the restaurants with delicious food .
Also they did many things for me and they send me to school and then teach me many things that I ca n't ca n't learn from school and they taught how to behave and how to be a person .
So whenever I 'm away from home I miss them very much and uh as in they were miss me very much too and uh I miss them because I I 'm the only son of their .
