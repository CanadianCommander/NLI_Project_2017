Actually when friends come from another country we 're going to spend time in my country , I would suggest them to visit the town where I live myself .
Um the reason I would is that I have fallen in love with since the first time I came there .
I think it is very beautiful situated in placed in the black forest and has um easy access to to other countries there , to France and to Switzerland and a lot of beautiful things to spend um time in doing there uh like visiting the black forest but also staying in town .
having look at the ancient um city .
And um I think that it would be very nice place to see if one come to the country without having much time to see a lot of places .
