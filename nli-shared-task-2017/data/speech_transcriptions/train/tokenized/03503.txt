 Uh to pass my TOEFL it was a big accomplishment for me because it could be , it will permit me , it will allow me to carry on my studies in < % 19.5 > in a country where they speak English .
Because I spent two , two year in Belgium where I got my graduation so I decide to , to rest and to carry on in South Africa .
So I have to pass my TOEFL then carry on my study if I can .
