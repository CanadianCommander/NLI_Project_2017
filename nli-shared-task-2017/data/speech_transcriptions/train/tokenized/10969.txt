Um an accomplishment that required me to work very hard was to uh learn Russian .
It was a dream I had since uh being a child and uh it was very difficult because I did study Russian during my uh five years at university .
So I had to schedule everyday to find some reading time and to learn and eventually I was able to travel to Ukraine and Russia to practice what I 've learned but it was difficult because um uh I had to schedule different things uh at the same time .
