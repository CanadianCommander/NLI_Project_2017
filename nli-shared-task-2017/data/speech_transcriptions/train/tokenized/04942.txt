When I am away from my home I miss my parent 's goodness so much uh ` cause they are so good but this is always when I am with them .
When I am far from them I miss them so much , so this is when I miss them and I realize how good they are .
Secondly I miss my mother 's food very much because I am so used to my mother 's menu and sometimes feel to the food outside .
And second is the the third thing I miss mostly is is my dog .
My dog 's name is Shady and she is my good friend and uh we spend a lot of good time , you know when we 're together .
