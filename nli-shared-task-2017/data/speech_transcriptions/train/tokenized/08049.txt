The quality um that make some valuable member of a team uh can have many characters , such as commitment , you should have excellence in the field .
Um you should have knowledge about your group members , your the work in which you are involved .
But I guess the most valuable quality is uh that you should be cooperative .
Because in a group you can work only if you are cooperative with others .
If you cooperate with ot - cooperate with others .
If you uh give your own ideas respect others ideas .
And uh is like you know the um you should have the commitment .
You should know what you 're uh , what you 're group mates are about to do .
You should listen to them you should listen to their ideas and then cooperate .
