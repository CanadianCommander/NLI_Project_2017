The thing I have uh missed most about my home when I 'm away is my parents .
Um they have always been supportive of me and they 've always been understanding .
When I was a kid and I used to make uh mistakes , they were always , they will , they would always forgive me for my mistakes .
Uh they would always um support me and even if I got low marks in a test , um they would be okay with it .
I have uh committed uh many mistakes in my uh life .
But then uh they have always been there for me .
I uh therefore really miss my parents when I 'm away from home .
Um a lot of time call them up .
