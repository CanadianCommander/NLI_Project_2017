I think the thing uh that I miss the most uh uh when I 'm away from my home is the time I spend with my parents .
I have a wonderful time with my parents .
I miss the food because I can never have that kind of uh tasty food .
I also miss uh family get togethers and spending time with relatives which I never get to have when I 'm away .
I really would like uh I mean I do n't uh I really miss the weather which is so nice in my home and uh my pet which really I 'm very much attached to .
So I miss all this things when I 'm away from my home .
