Prefer , I prefer reading the magazines rather than novels or poetry because of the magazines provide a lot of information that we it can just have a lot of magazines can have a lot of information throughout the world and through on a particular topic and we uh < % > of uh information about various topics also .
So by reading the magazines we can learn the information uh and various topic not only in a particular topic .
But various novels and poetry will not provide the uh same meaning for the uh all the topics .
They will give you only information only about only particular topic .
So the magazines is a more convenient to prepare to study these magazines .
That 's why I I am interested to study in the magazines rather than the poetry or novels .
These magazines will be helpful helpful a lot a lot for creating , it will be more recreation for to us than novels or .
