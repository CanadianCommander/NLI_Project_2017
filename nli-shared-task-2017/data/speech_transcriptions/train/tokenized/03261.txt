I think there 's a common event about my piano competition .
I have learn piano from I was four years old when I was a child and since then I always play the piano uh once a week .
Um prepare for the piano competition you have to practice it everyday and everyday without interruption and you must concentrate on it with your whole heart and you have to listen to your teacher and choose the good song .
So I think piano competition is very important for me it is meaningful .
