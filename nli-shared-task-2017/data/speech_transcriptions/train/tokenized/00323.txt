The book I 'm interested to read is that the book I have , I 've written and published .
The book is written for a university student teaching uh teaching them how to write elegant English articles .
The book begins with how to use a precise and uh interesting words can , to get a high mark .
So uh you know many Chinese students they often use good and and so uh this are simple words .
So I teach them to use uh a little bit , a little bit complicated words such as uh , for example if you wanna use good , you have to change it with great and now , I began with words and then I go to sentences and I have , I ask them to remember a lot of uh sentence structure .
