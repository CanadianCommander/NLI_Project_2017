The type of reading material which I mostly do are basically uh novels basically because they have characters which portray everyday people and they stress on on the on their common aim , ideals , goals uh which are easy to relate to .
They help to develop imaginative skills as well as they allow you to explore new places , new and different uh cultures , get into touch with your , get into touch with your emotions , with the uh and basically it allows a place for you to explore .
