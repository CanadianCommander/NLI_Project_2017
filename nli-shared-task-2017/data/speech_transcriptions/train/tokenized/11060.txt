A book um I think is very interesting is a book called Burning House .
I enjoyed this book because it was mystery .
I enjoy mystery books because there is always um suspense and it keeps gets you thinking .
The book uh involve the character that seems very strange and somehow evil but in the end we find out that she is actually um she is actually telling the truth and being specific and it was not her that was being evil but another man who was supposed to be good .
So things are not what they seem .
