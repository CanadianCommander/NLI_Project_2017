An interesting book I 've read is Da Vinci Code .
I believe that book um has allowed , has made me question my own beliefs .
Even though it sounds kinda weird , anything that makes me question my own self it 's great because it it it it tells me that I 'm learning , I 'm constantly learning um new stuff even though it was n't what I was what I believed in the in the beginning , by shedding my old way of thinking of of thinking , you know , it uh allows me to evolve , I mean to um to get better at my own self with my with my own self , and this this book really made me question my own self and get beyond what I already know .
