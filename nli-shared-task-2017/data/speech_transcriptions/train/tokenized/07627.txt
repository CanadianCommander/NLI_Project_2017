Actually I am on and I am thinking of working for tourist main home center for oversees guests , or something like trading companies , because I really wanna use my English skills for my job .
Um , um , uh my first choice will be travel company because I studied tourism industry studies here at University for one year .
So by that I can use my English skills and my knowledge I got through that year .
