The accomplishment that required me to work really hard was learning violin .
I love music but at first I was reluctant to , to go to the violin classes and learn something and to play violin .
But then initially , uh but then after that I started uh getting interest in my play , playing the instrument and my , the notes were getting correct .
I got some interest in that and that was seriously an accomplishment on , uh as now I have cleared my third grade from the Community College of London and now I am a third year , third grade student of violin .
Now I can seriously impress my colleagues by playing my notes of violin .
