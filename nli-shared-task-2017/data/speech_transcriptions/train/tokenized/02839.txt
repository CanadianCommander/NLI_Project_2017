If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country , I would say um Cologne is the best pl-place to visit because um because of it 's culture and there are a lot of uh historical sites like the Cologne cathedral and um people are very friendly and open minded .
And besides um there is much more to see in Cologne um like nightlife and uh the university in Cologne which is very famous um those are probably uh the most things .
And that is why I suggest Cologne for a visit if friends from another country are visiting .
