The thing I miss most about uh when I 'm away from home is the food made by my mother .
Uh first of all because I do n't think anything in restaurants are or uh outside uh place resembles or tastes as delicious as the food she prepares .
And I miss it most because uh I can not even uh cook a single meal .
So uh when I 'm hungry I just remember that uh how delicious it was to have the food which my mum prepared .
