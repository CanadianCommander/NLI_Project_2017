To me , the main quality of a member of a team is understanding , because if you can understand with who you 're working with , you can go on with your work .
Some people are just so selfish about their ideas and their actions , so if you do n't understand your team , you ca n't go on .
You ca n't go tolerate , you can tense .
That 's the main problem of some team when you 're working on a team at school , because there 's always some kind of boss in a team .
And if this boss is not understanding for all the other members , you ca n't , you ca n't do something good .
You 're just uh doing something selfish and something , uh one way , one way vision or something .
So understanding is the best quality .
