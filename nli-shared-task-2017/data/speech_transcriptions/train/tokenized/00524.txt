One of the great accomplishments that I have pursued was that , in my life was a dream that I 've always wanted I have always had which was uh being a journalist and uh uh now I finished my school and I applied for university to have uh , uh to study uh to another major .
Uh and I pursued that dream , it was an accomplishment for me because it truly required a lot of hard work at uh my high school and throughout all of my school years but I 'm certainly in uh more precisely in grade ten , eleven , twelve in uh high school because I had to study really hard to accomplish that .
