Different magazines about different uh so subjects because they contain a lot of material which is uh short , useful and uh informative about everything .
And I like the format in which the magazine is written .
I 'm not so much into , into , I 'm not so much into novels because uh they 're very long and uh they deal with mainly a storyline or something like that but uh magazines are more specific and you can easily see what sections you want to read within the magazine .
Magazines are um basically what I like to read more than novels or poetry .
