The last opportunity that was given to me was this summer and I have the chance to go to Mexico , uh to Chihuahua in , in the state of Chihuahua which is uh in the North .
Uh because my dad uh he had a colleague working in the institution .
And in the same institution I got an internship in the uh business relationship department .
And it was very important for me because to go to a foreign country such as Mexico , um gives you a good um language background , you learn the language very well during that time and it 's also good for your resume .
Because if you put that on your resume you speak out in the crowd .
