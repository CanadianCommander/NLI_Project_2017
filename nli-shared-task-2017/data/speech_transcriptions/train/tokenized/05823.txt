The thing I miss most about my when I 'm away uh parents because they 're my life support system .
The people whom I 've met while I 've been away from home have n't been very supportive and helpful particularly and that 's the reason I feel in fact , that 's the reason why I miss my parents when I 'm away from home .
That 's all .
