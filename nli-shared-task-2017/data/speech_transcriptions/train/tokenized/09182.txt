Such as novels , magazine , poetry but most of the time I would prefer magazines to read .
I would prefer this because I 'm an engineer and as being an engineer I would like to keep in touch with the current affairs .
Some software engineers in the contemporary era and what new technology is or being established .
these are the things I would be so all these things are provided in the magazines in the much better in a comprehensive manner .
But as far as novels and poetry are concerned they generally lead to romanticism which is uh not uh uh which is not of my use so I would prefer to read from the magazines as much as possible .
