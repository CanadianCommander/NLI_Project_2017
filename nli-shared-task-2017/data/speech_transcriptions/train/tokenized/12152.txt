The Awakening is a really interesting book which I have recently read in my world literature class .
It is a book which emphasizes the idea of women and how they use the independence after having children .
And the author is very interesting person because she reflects her own life in this book by saying that women are undermined and always be belittled by uh by society and this does - does n't allow women to express themselves and become what they really want to be .
The Awakening is a source or a very critical book in the sense that they are always criticizing men for having all the rights and women for having none at all .
