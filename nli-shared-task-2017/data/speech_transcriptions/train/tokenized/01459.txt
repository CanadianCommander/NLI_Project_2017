One of my favorite books is Sex and the City .
Honestly I do not like readings that much .
I read this book is because I watch the TV series , Sex and the City uh on the TV , and I find it so interesting .
I wanted to see the original copy but later I found this book was such a great uh help to me especially when I have some you know uh love affair or I just ended up a relationship or I was just had crush on somebody and this book was like um it give a lots of advise .
And lots of do 's and don'ts for , such a great book that I like .
