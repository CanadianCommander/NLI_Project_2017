For me a quality that makes someone valuable as a member of a team is the quality of leadership .
It 's really important , because that makes someone when you are working in a , in a group to lead the others and also it helps to encourage the other which uh think the others are doing .
Also a leadership may have more uh wider kno - , knowledge of uh things that the other one to do , so he can helped , he or she can help uh the others uh in the things that they want to do .
Also uh , he maybe also uh older than the others and will have more experience to teach to the others .
