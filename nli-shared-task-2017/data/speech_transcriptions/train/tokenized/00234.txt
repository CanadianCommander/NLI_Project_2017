Special opportunity that which I was given was going to South Africa .
Seeing people who are very poor living on the sides of highways made me want to help people and job that it was able to help people .
That was the time when I realized I wanted to be a doctor .
By this opportunity , I was able to realize my , my life goal was to be a doctor and help those people who are suffering from po - poverty and health issues that they 're not even given a chance to be helped out .
