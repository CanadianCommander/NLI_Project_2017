If friends from other country uh would like to visit in my country I will suggest them to visit Bombay because I have been there for two years I have been working there I have seen Bombay uh and I feel it 's a place to visit .
It 's multicultural place people from every part of India is staying there and uh it 's very very uh precious basically to visit uh from the monuments like like gateway of India .
