It was really interesting , because first it was good for my language is to make me speak better English .
And then uh it was also um meant to help me being able to start in any , any circumstances , like going in another country with nothing there , nobody I know and I think I 'm just start working .
And get a job , get uh um the job I had to get a place to live , get everything of this it 's like a good opportunity to learn a living from nothing or get ready to go to another country anywhere later .
