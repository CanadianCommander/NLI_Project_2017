I found the book the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho very interesting and I have often referred to it .
It is about the journey of a young adolescent boy in search of a treasure .
During the journey he meets a woman he falls in love with but he must fulfill some conditions and so he continues on his treasure trip .
At the end of the journey he realizes that there is actually no treasure till he 's again led to it .
He , it speaks about various challenges that he faces during the journey .
How he 's tricked and how he 's helped by various people and how he grows from a foolish , naive boy to a person who has gained wisdom because of his experiences .
