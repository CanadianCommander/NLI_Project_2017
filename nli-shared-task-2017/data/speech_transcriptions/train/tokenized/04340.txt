I think to become a valuable member of a team first of all you have to be uh honour the people otherwise no one can trust you .
If no one trust you no one want to be a friend with you , so the honour is the most important thing I are .
And if you have honour you can do lots of good things that 's why people can trust you , that 's why people can talk with you and give some information and some special things for you .
So being honour people is the most important thing to become a valuable member of a team or a group .
Or become uh it 's an important thing to become a honour people .
