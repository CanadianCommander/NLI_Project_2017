As a girl , I was able to go and study abroad in the United States .
Since I live in a third world country which is El Salvador um this means that I could have a better future , a better education and prepare myself more for any kind of challenges I might find during my life .
Therefore , um it was very important for me , for my family and for any other any other things that I might do with the future .
Also my field of studies was not available in my country and going to the United States meant that I would be able to study what I wanted to , and um this was just better .
