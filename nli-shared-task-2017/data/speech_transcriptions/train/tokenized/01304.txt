During my free time I like um to read magazine rather than novels because first uh I can read uh for uh short time interesting and uh various uh subject .
Whereas if I would like to to read novel I have to take much more time .
Besides in magazines I like it to follow the the events and everyday so I buy I buy a newspaper in order to see what happen in my country and also over the world .
And novel is much much more story seeker um narrative .
