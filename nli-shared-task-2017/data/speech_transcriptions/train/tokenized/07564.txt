One of the most special opportunities I have received is to lead a kaizen team .
During a a kaizen event one is able to work with other employees in a company .
The main purpose is to innovate , optimize processes and to make anything better .
So by leading one of these events one is able to practice leadership , work with others , strengthen their communication skills and at the end what you see is that you have made some good for your company .
So in my opinion one special opportunity I received was that I was a leader for this event .
This has sharpened my skills and it has made me uh a better person .
So I appreciate this opportunity .
