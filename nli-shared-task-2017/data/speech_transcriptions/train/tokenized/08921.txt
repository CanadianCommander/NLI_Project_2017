Uh after I finish uh , after I finish the school my father gave me the chance to travel for a study .
I think this was , this was very good chance for me to to meet different people from different cultures and nationalities uh it was really good experience and it taught me how to depend myself and to managing different uh situations .
Um because uh you know when you 'll be surrounded by your parents and your brothers and friends uh it 's easy for you , you 'll get everything but uh now you have to manage everything by yourself so it was really good experience .
