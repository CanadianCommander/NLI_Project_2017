So uh what I miss the most uh about my home when uh I am away uh is of course my friends .
Because I really like them and uh we 're used to play sport , to , to go away to go to the cinema , the theater .
And uh I really miss the people I really like .
Uh of course it also include my family because it 's very important .
And being away for a long time could be a bit difficult because uh you , you 're not used to miss the people uh live with you all the time .
And uh I think for me it 's difficult .
And the last thing I would say is my home because I like my bedroom so much .
