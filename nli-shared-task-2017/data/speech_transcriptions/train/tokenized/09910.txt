I think wha - uh what I miss the most about my home when I am away is uh my bed uh because uh I usually , when I , I am at home uh I am usually on my bed to take a rest and uh that I like much sleeping and when I take uh rest on bed uh I feel very calm and uh very uh relax so .
So I think the bed is uh most missing things in my home .
