Uh a book I find particularly interesting is Lord of the Rings because it has uh very different fantastic characters and a fantastic world .
And although this was and characters are fantastic they are related uh chara - to the characters in real world like the hobbits uh symbolize the the people uh farm farmer people who live in the village and uh there are nobles who relate to the bosses of industrial age .
