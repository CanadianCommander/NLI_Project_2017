Mostly I miss my family and my uh , uh dog which is Golden Retriever and I miss him too much because I ca n't take him with my , I ca n't take him with me to the holidays .
Uh and I am the responsible person of hi - of my dog so I do n't feel comfortable if I 'm not nearby him .
Because I do n't know whether the people are , how are the people are interacting with him .
How are they looking after him ?
So I just most miss him and uh I feel sorry for him uh because I 'm not seeing him .
I also miss my home too because as I said home sweet home .
Uh it is the most . ..
