Um uh one of the most interesting books that I have read up to now has to be The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho .
Simply because the way he has put the um goals of life in a very interesting manner .
Um I 'd have to say that that book has helped me a lot to think about what I really want in life and how I should get it and how I should be successful in getting it and how nothing else really matters .
Um at twenty one , a very crucial age in fact a very confusing age The Alchemist has provided me with some amazing insights to what human power and mind can actually do .
