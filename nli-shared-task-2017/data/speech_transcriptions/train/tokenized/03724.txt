The interesting book that I had ever read was The General book which was written by .
This book shows , shows the details about the animals and the nature and the plant that behaved in a natural way .
This books depends uh this book totally depends on the on the nature of the elements uh animals , basically a fox where a group of fox have a committee uh how to um offspring and the parental offspring um .
So this book generally tells about living nature of the animals and which uh which also depends on the human nature .
