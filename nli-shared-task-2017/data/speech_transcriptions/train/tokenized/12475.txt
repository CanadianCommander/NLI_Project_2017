Last year I had the opportunity to study in the US for a year and um I , it was really important for me to see how it was different from uh the , the way of studying in France .
And it 's , it was really great because I could I , between my study I could work in lab .
That was not possible for me in France and I felt that was a great way of studying physics which is my major and um I hope that I will be able to do that um experience again next year .
