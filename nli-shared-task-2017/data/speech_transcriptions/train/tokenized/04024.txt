What I really miss uh when I 'm away from home is not my prime apartment or things that I have in France like I do n't know clothes .
Um , anyway uh what I miss is my family and my friends uh I miss my friends when I cant talk with my friends every day ever on the phone .
Talk to her about my problems my uh , all the things I , I , I have on my head , and my family of course my mo and my dad and my brother .
Um which I love and that uh I feel very bad when I 'm away from them .
I need to talk to them a lot .
