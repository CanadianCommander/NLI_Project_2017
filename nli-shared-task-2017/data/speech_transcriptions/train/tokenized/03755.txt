Two years ago I 've got the opportunity to go the < % > association in Romania um there um I went to an orphanage uh with disabled girls .
So it was uh quite challenge for me because um I am saying that I have quite problem with children but in fact um I had n't any problem and it was very good time .
I play with the kids and the , we were quite close at the end and it was very sad when we left .
So I remember these events for whole of my life .
