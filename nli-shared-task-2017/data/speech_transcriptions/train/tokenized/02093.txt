They , recently I had the opportunity of attending the prestigious Harvard World Model United Nations Conference .
The conference was held in Beijing and it was a simulation of the UN carried out by students .
This experience was very important for me since I had the opportunity to work with a diverse set of people from all around the world .
We came up with a solution for uh resolving the problem uh concerning HIV/AIDS education and prevention .
We reached our goal for the task we were given , given and therefore this experience uh was one that I will never forget and was very important for me .
