I miss my home when I was away , my mom , my dad and my si - sister .
And the main main thing is that I miss my uh the food that uh my mother cooks and my and later the next one is my f - uh friends who always stay nearby my home and and I miss the fun which we 'll be having with my parents and also with my friends .
And um and the last one is a pla - about the about my place where um I 'll be missing many places where I 've been siting with my friends and all of those .
So I miss my , I miss my home and my place when I 'll be away .
