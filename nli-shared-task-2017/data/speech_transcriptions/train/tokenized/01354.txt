When I 'm uh away from the uh home I miss uh mostly my mother , my father and my sister .
Um uh because I 'm not get used to uh from away from uh them and uh I uh miss my room , my bed uh um and also I miss my friends uh I need always because I share all my feelings all my thou - all my thoughts and all my stress with them .
And also I miss my teddy bear because uh I sleep uh with with them uh still .
