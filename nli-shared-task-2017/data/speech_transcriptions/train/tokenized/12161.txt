What , what I miss most about home when I am away is the atmosphere .
And because I like to sit in my family and to share a meal for example .
The second thing I really miss uh is the object that reminds me of my childhood .
And the third things would be my books .
Because I like to read through my books again and to find again what I learned when I was younger .
Because I could n't bring all my books uh away from , from home .
um fourth thing would be the kitchen because it reminds me of all the cakes that my mother cooked when I , when I was younger .
So um the atmosphere , the childhood and my books would be certain things that I really miss when I am away .
