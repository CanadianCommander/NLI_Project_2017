Well actually I have n't really had a chance to have some friends to visit me in my own home town and um it 's been good I think , I really have the routine down bad by the way .
So the first place I would visit is the capital since we have right there and you know the capital so we go there and we visit the most important places , buildings and to see the architectures style the city has to offer the tourist .
Um then right after that we go to visit some touristic place , we go to the beach and then finally I take them to my uh to my home town because I have a lot of memories and things from my childhood I would always love to show to everyone wants to know a little bit more about it .
