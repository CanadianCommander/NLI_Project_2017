I mainly read uh ancient literature because I 'm a classic student and uh well I should explain why I 'm a classic student .
Well because I like ancient literature and uh linked to this ancient literature is the any scholar literature secondary sources uh commentaries .
Uh I like reading this because it uh helps me get out of the uh day to day world uh of the real world um helps me get out of the real world and create a an imaginary world uh where I can reconstitute history fragments and I like that .
