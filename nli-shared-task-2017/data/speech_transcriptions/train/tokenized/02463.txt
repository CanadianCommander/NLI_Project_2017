A special opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity to study biological sciences at Cambridge uh on a scholarship funded by Trinity college .
And this was a special opportunity for me because it would not have been possible for me to have come here to Cambridge without the financial support given by the college .
And uh it has been a very good learning experience I 'm able to study under some of the best professors and the minds in the world and I have been able to make use of facilities which would not have been available in my home country .
I have also had the opportunity to come and live in a new country and interact with the wide variety of people from diverse backgrounds .
