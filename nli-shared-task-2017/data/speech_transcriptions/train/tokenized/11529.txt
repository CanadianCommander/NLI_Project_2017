My which you will miss most when you 're away from home is that you you are not surrounded by anything that you grew up with .
For example inside your room you do n't have the pictures of your family and friends who do n't have your and I think that is the most important thing because you have somewhere where you sleep when you need to be really comfortable .
Uh also you the food that your mum cooks is very different from what you tend to eat when you are away from home .
There is something special about your mums cooking I think I miss that a lot .
