Um this monastery um was um destroyed during the riots in two thousand and four .
It was quite interesting for me because I had to be a real leader for um my soldiers and the um in winter it was very hard um because it was um it was very cold and uh we had to rebuild this monastery and uh in a high stressed situation .
Um it .
