A recent book that I read was called The Peace that Ends All Peace .
It 's about the end of The First World War and it 's about the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East .
And at the end of the First World War the Ottoman Empire lost the war and the Middle East was essentially taken away from the Ottoman Empire with uh an agreement but the book essentially details about the uh relationship the elite forces , specifically England had with the Arab tribes and the uh dealings and the uh relationships and uh uh conducted in order to win he war in the Middle East and take away Middle East from the Ottoman Empire .
