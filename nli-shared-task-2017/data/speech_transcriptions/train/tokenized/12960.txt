What I mostly miss when I get out of my area I 'd say out my city out of my country .
I really , I really miss mostly my family in particular .
My father and mother and especially brothers .
I also uh sometimes in some extent I miss my neighborhood also .
The neighborhood that I I rose in and I grew in and the friends I acce - I got from this neighborhood .
Uh another thing is uh the whole country , the whole city that I 'm living in the roads , the cars , the people , the whole thing .
