I think what makes someone member of the team is leadership .
Leadership is what can lead the entire team into a successful des - uh destination .
Um in my experience , I was the president of film making club in school and uh I used leadership skill and I could lead them into successful and very fun activity of film making .
For that reason I think leadership as the a as a leader can help member of a team and it would lead to success .
