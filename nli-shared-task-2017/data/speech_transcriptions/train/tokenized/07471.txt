Well , I would suggest they go to Hamburg which is my hometown .
I grew up there and uh I 've been living there for twenty four years up to now and it is a beautiful city .
It has a lake in the middle of it and it has beautiful old entrance in the city part .
There is a river flowing through it and it 's also very close to the sea and close to Berlin the capital of Germany .
so it 's pretty starting point to uh go to other places as well .
In addition um Germany uh Hamburg usually has quite good weather as well .
It is close to Denmark .
So we can also go there as well .
It 's just beautiful on the weekend to like lay at the lake or uh go the beach and enjoy of course all the wonderful pubs and .
