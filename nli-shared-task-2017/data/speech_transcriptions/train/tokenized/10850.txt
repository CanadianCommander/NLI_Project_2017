If then I can choose job or a career that I want then I would choose to become a teacher .
The reason , the reason that I want to become a teacher is that being a teacher can always give you a sense of achievement , um by teaching other people and uh you will gain respect to yourself .
And also there is a Chinese old saying that goes , uh to teach is to learn .
Which means teachers by teaching not only benefits the teacher but it benefits the students but also benefits the , the teacher .
You , I am the , the , the kind of person who always want to learn , and I think this is the best way to learn something from other people .
To also different kind of experience even though they are the students , but they can still teach you valuable lessons .
