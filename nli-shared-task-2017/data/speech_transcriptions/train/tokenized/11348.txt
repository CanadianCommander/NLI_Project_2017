The kind of reading material I choose is magazines rather than novels or poetry .
I choose this because magazines are the place where we can find real things and we could gather more information in compare to novels and um poetry .
Uh if we turn to novels or poetry there are some thing which usually which is not realistic or which we do n't make it all wrong .
Maybe some things some one says and we should read at them .
But magazines are even practical .
It gives us uh the real information in our daily life .
we can at a glance we can it is very impressive even to see and to glance we can know what it is and what is happening around us .
So I choose this .
