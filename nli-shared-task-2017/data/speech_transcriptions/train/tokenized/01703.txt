Um if a friend coming from far away would have the chance to um visit Italy I would probably suggest my village .
Um it 's very small village but it 's it 's full of castles and museums every where and it 's really close to a big river so it could be a good occasion to um organize trips .
And um why not just go to the beach um I really would suggest this place also because it 's uh full of friendly people and uh this person coming from abroad um could have the chance to appreciate the culture um and the pe - and the people um living uh in my village .
So I think it could be a very very good choice and my friend would probably appreciate it .
