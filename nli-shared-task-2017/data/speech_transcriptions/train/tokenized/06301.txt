I had last summer holidays I was USA , San Francisco California and it was a very great opportunity f - to go there um I learned so much new things to know and um I learned English , I 've improved it .
I like that so many people to know , it was so much fun .

Um we did so many things and I really liked to get the stage to know um there 's so many things you can do there special , that 's so different to Europe to Germany .
