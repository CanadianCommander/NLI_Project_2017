There are things there are things that I really miss when I 'm away from my place .
First one is my bed I think really it 's really a comfortable one uh I love to sleep in my bed .
I ca n't sleep in some others actually I like it .
So my family because I really love to be obviously surrounded by them , I love to wake up and to see my mother , to kiss her and after to to have uh coffee with my father , chat a bit with my my brothers and to stay there for a while for < % > .
Finally I really miss a lot the food , I like how the way mother is cooking and I really miss it when I 'm away , um a good cooker so I always loved uh eating at my place with all my family .
