I like the police novels uh because it 's uh full of action and mysterious stories uh different types of crimes and criminals and I love to know how the criminals think .
Uh I like to know how they find out who 's the killer and know what happened and how did it happen and everything .
I really find that uh very interesting and very amusing .
Uh I also like it because uh and that 's it 's like the only fun novels to me .
I do n't like the romantic ones because it 's only about love and lovers which I do n't like .
