When I go when I am away from I miss first I miss my family .
I like my father and I live in the I lived with grandparents and father and mother and three brothers .
They are always kind to me .
So uh I live in Tokyo alone now .
So I really miss them but I can talk with them by using phone .
So I can feel , I can feel together with them .
