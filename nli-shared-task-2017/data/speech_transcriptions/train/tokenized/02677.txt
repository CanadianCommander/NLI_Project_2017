I suggest the Kyoto because I live in I I come from Japan and Japanese to any kind of Japanese old history and it was so far .
And also I I recommend the Osaka too because the Osaka is is the near the Kyoto and uh it has a lot of fun stuffs such as the Universal Studios of Japan and uh some pavilions and it 's it was so fun and uh also eating is very good .
The food was very good .
So I recommend uh Kyoto and Osaka .
