Uh well friend of mine go to China and I recommend him to go to because that 's , that 's a really good place .
And first it 's really good , it has really good food there , I really enjoy living there and go to uh and enjoying , enjoying different kind of food that 's really um , I had a great time at back then .
And the other reason is there are many museum in that city , you can go back to Chi - go , go go back t , to the Chinese history in that museum .
And have a touch of the time , have touch of the country 's past .
I think that is the good thing about Guangzhou is food and museum .
