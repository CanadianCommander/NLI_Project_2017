The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh participating into the New York Marathon in the year two thousand .
At the time I was eighteen years old and I had to prepare it as well as I could because it was really important to me and that was a great accomplishment since it was successful or I really wanted to be well ranked because it would be a proof of my worth .
And it also needed it to prove myself that I could be uh in a position and I could be able to go beyond my own limits , therefore it was the best accomplishment that required me to work very hard .
