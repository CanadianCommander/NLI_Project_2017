A boo - , a book which I recently read was The Stranger by Albert Camus .
This book really interested me because it was basically talking about a person who did not fit in society and challenged all aspects of society .
He regarded everything that he did in his life as absurd .
This is really interesting because today , uh always uh to everything and everything we do .
However , this person did n't uh was , did n't care about anything he did and he , he based his life on ab - uh absurd views .
For example when his mother died , he did - , he did n't show that he cared .
All he did was he passively moved on and which led to his demise .
