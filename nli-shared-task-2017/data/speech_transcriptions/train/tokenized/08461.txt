The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the best student award which I got when I was in class ninth .
This uh award was very important to me because this award has uh very prominence in our area and were all the Koreans around our area knows what uh , about the award given by our school .
So , getting a best student award from our school means student is really good .
And by having this award you can get admission to any college with full aid .
So I had to work very hard in the class ninth to get this award .
