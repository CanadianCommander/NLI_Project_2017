I think to have a member of a team is very important because we can not live by myself and winning we always need others help .
They always encourage and help help each other and they can be powered to do everything and sometimes we have to compare with others co-to improve by myself like skills and abilities , and uh winning uh the most important things is to help each other , um it can make other relationship more strong and more big .
