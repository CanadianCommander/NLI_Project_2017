If I was given a chance to choose any career I wanted , I would a career in the field of art .
The reason being that uh art would give me a way to express myself , uh it would be a hobby so it means I would have a pa - passion for it and I would love to do it and what could be better than being paid for a hobby .
Some of the artists today are some of the highest paid people in the entire world and some of them also and they are also very famous .
So uh art could give me a chance to express myself , uh it would be what I love to do and would pay me very well .
That is why I would choose a career in art .
