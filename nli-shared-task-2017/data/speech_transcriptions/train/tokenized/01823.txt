My special opportunity was uh American , American meeting .
Uh it was a very practical meeting because American culture talks uh directly and practically .
So each other it talks about a program and uh so Japanese culture is a uh meeting in Japan in in the companies .
So it takes so long and uh so sometimes it does n't work uh it was very good .
