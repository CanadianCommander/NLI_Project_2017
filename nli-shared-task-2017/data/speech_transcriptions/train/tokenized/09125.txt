When I , when I 'm away from my home , I mostly miss my friends because we have quite uh , a lot of fun time together , uh for example these beaches and uh have some fun at those places .
Apart from that I miss my family a lot .
Because uh I have been living with my for a long time .
So whenever uh I am so far away from them uh I miss uh the things that we always do .
For example eating together at the dining table .
And uh site seeing the places that we always go .
For example going to the uh sea shores is uh very important activity for us .
