I believe effort and diligence is the two most important factor that I think make someone a valuable member of a team .
First , effort , when somebody put an effort on a team member or whatever is a team member at lea - , even though we lose at least we put an effort , we did our best on a game , that 's why I think it 's better .
Second , diligence , whenever you 're tired , you , whenever you 're tired , you ca n't even run , but because you have diligence , I think you can run and yeah play a game .
I think that 's the , the most important quality .
