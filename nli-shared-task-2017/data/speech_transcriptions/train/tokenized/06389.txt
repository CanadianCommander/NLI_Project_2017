The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was to learn to play the piano .
I learned to play the piano at an uh advanced age so I was older and my fingers did n't want to go so fast as for younger childs , children and so it was uh very hard for me to learn it .
I needed to learn a piano because I am an opera singer and I need it for my job so it was very important uh that I learned it well .
I took a lot of lessons uh and after two or three years practice I could uh play very small pieces , sit on the piano and uh I could play myself while singing my .
That was great .
