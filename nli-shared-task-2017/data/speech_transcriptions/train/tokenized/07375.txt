I was the school leader of my relationship of the school .
As a leader as a leader of the students I had to organize a welcome party .
I had to organize a welcome party for the coming two years and party also include the professors and lecturers of my school .
We had to thank them for all their support and all the knowledge that they have given us after all this for all those years .
We had to show our gratitude , there was a point when we felt like we have to in a way tell how much care we for them .
How is like they have changed our mindsets .
