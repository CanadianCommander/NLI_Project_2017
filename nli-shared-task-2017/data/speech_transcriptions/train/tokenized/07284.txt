One of the interesting book that I have read is my textbook in my at my graduation because of course it was one of my favorite subject and it included a good examples and uh pictures that are also been < % > displayed throughout very easy to understand and of course the author clearly stated what was the function of each and every block .
So for example if we can star our he clearly explained everything about the diagram < % > etcetera so I really like the textbook .
In generality I like other magazines but I think this book is the better one .
