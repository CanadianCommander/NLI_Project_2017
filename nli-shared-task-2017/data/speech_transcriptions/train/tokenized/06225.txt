Well a very special opportunity that was given to me was uh that I was off - offered a scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service after I finished high school .
Uh they invited me to come and study in Germany , in Berlin and they would cover all my financial expenses .
That was a great opportunity for me because it represented , you know , a chance to go abroad for stud - studying uh while not having to carry the burden of you know financial , uh th - the the burden of financial uh carry the financial burden of it .
That 's why it was very important to me to acquire this scholarship .
