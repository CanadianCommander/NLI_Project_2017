My free time I usually read novels and magazines .
Um the first is novels because they provide very interesting stories which make my free time pass away um pass like nothing .
I read also magazines because um they usually handle interesting topics which may also be related to topics that I uh deal with during my studies .
So I like to combine study time and free time by reading some magazines .
Novels on the other hand are not always related to .
