If I had friends coming um to visit or to send time in my country , first of all I will suggest him to visit Paris because it 's the capital of the of the country .
It 's very great town with lots of histories .
Among those museums places I think also that it 's a place that has to be seen when you come in France .
Uh moreover it 's very appreciate places for all the people coming in France for holiday or spend sometime .
And uh secondly , I maybe would suggest them to visit uh my native place of of living because it 's also very nice place .
