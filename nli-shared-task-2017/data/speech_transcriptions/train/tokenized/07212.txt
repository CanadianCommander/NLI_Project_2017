Interesting book that I 've read recently would be The Da Vinci Code .
Why I like this book so much is because it is intriguing , fast paced and very lively .
In fact the details that are involved , that is the historical details uh would be quite boring if you would have to have to read them on themselves .
But since it 's in the form of a story and interesting one at , it makes for good reading as well as improves your general knowledge and your historical knowledge as well .
In our daily lives we 're caught up with such hectic schedules that we rarely get time to read and when we do and get books like this , it is very interesting and keeps you informed and so books .
