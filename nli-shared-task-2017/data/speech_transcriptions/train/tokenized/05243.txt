I had a very good opportunity in going to Brussels because I did a stage in Brussels in a big Brussels law firm .
And in uh that Brussels law firm I had a good chance to see how international law world works .
So uh it , I got a lot of information on how to move on the masters , to follow to work in an international law firm because of staying here in Turin I do not have any chance to see this world and to know anything about this world .
