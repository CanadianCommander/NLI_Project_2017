I think a very important value in a team is uh leadership uh because every tea - every team needs a leader and one of the team members has to be the leader .
The leader is also the boss of the group and he has the possibility to uh to motivate uh the other members of the team .
He can also uh bring the the discussions into a certain uh certain direction .
He can lead it into a certain direction .
So I 'm pretty that leadership is one of the most important values of at least one member of the team .
