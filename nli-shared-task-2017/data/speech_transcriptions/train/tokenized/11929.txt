Well if I were to um receive a job opportunity , I would choose to , to work in a firm of architecture since I 'm a student of architecture .
And that 's one of my greatest inspirations and it would be specifically a firm of architecture in New York city since I am going to or planning to study at Columbia University in New York .
And architecture is one of my most um favorite inspirations .
So working with a firm of architecture since I 'm studying that , would be a great experience to me to in the future .
