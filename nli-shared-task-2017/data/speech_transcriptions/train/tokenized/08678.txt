There are three things I miss uh when I 'm out from home when I 'm away .

I like my bed because uh in my bed I sleep very well .
The second , uh second thing I miss is the kitchen .
I like to do uh the kitchen and I like to prepare uh the food any kind I like to do it .
The for , the third thing I miss finally is uh my family , family ; close contact with them .
And when I 'm away I am not uh in contact with them .
