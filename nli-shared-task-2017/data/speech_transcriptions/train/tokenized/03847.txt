An interesting book that I have read recently has been an autobiography by Lee Iacocca .
Why I though this book was reality was that it describes very clearly the struggles and story of the life of Lee Iacocca .
It and and it describes in greater deal about the hardships he went through has his parents were immigrants to the America country to the time when he goes on to lead one of the biggest organizations in the coal manufacturing industries the .
It also gives us interesting detail how he quit at a very successful and took over at Chrysler to start to bring the company back into the top numbers after it had failed miserably .
