Well if I every go with my friends to the my country then I probably ask them to visit almost all the places that are in and around my city as well as uh okay they stay and stretch the whole country is we 're already famous for almost the everything that is happening around for example , it is famous for it 's historical , it 's a famous for historical places and it 's oh it 's basically a < % > of what exactly our country shows .
So I would rather want my friends to see every little part and enjoy every part of my country rather than one single place .
Uh so if my friends are coming to my country then I would uh ask them to visit the whole country .
