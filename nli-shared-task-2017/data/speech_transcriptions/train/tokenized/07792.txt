In my free time , I like to read magazines instead of novels or poetry because I think magazines uh you get more information from magazines such as pictures um when you read novels or poetry kind of uh what kind of what kind of things are awaiting but you read magazines you gain the information from pictures as well as from the writings .
Um I also like magazines because it has short articles and I do n't like to read long um writings .
