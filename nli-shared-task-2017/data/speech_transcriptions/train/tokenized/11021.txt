I like to read novels in my free times .
The first , the first reason is it can improve my reading skills for example one of my friend came to Canada one year ago and she told me she could not understand English reading very well .
But after she start to read a novel her English improved improved a lot .
And second reason is it can be provide topic between friends and me .
We can talk about talk and discuss about novel in every single chat .
It can be upgrade quality of conversation between friends and me .
