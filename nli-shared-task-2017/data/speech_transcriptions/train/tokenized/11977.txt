Like my friends to go to Paris for many reasons .
Uh the first one is that Paris is , the , has uh a cultural crowd uh for France that is very important to see .
Uh for example , uh there are a museums , um they were uh places that were really important for French revolution but for , also for French history and uh our public live , uh citizens .
Also France uh Paris is at the centre of France about networks .
To go uh to a each uh regions of France .
So this is also a great place uh for events , uh for parties .
Uh and to conclude I would like to say that there is uh a big place for students to , to have uh great contact with all the students .
