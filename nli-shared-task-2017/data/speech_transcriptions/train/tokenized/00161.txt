The most really interesting book I read was which is um a the very interesting and distracting book uh and < % > describes the world we are living by by giving examples of dwarfs um who live in a big city .
And uh let 's say you do n't have the humans before but um it 's it 's a little bit joking and more fun than just the actual human interaction if you have dwarfs uh that interact with like humans .
Hard to describe but very interesting book .
