If my friends were from another country were going to spend time in my country , I would ask them to spend time in the city of Mumbai .
The reason I say this is because this city is very friendly and lively , so people will like to stay over here .
Also the people over here are very hospitable , so again that is a positive sign .
Again it is very uh living here is also good because there are a lot of activities that can be done us uh it 's close to the sea so there are a lot of activities that you can do like motorboat skiing and swimming .
