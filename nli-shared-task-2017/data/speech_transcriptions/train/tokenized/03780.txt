I came from a family uh then economic background .
Since childhood my priorities were set such that I had to excel in any field that I study .
After high school I had to attend undergraduate college uh I had to exam that required really hard work .
To make it to the top five colleges uh one had to be uh in the top one percent of the people for the test .
Uh they were about people offering for the test .
So I believe it was my greatest achievement when I made it in the top one percent and made it to the best colleges in my country .
