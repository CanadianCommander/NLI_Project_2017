Uh one of the most important qualities for someone to be a valuable member of the team is uh being a team worker .
I think been a team worker is very important because it makes uh other people in your team better and you can also show them how valuable you are by sacrificing yourself depending what sport or what team you 're in but for example , physical sport , by sacrificing your body uh showing your body in front of the ball or anything like that .
It shows them how how much of how you much you care about this team and how much you try to be team member and try to make uh good win or a good game for the team .
