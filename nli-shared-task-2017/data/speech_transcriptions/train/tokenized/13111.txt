I would suggest them to visit Istanbul because of several reasons .
First of all uh it 's a cultural and modern city at the same time .
Uh it has uh museums to go and also uh concerts or um place like these .
Uh and um secondly , uh it 's an um it 's the only city surrounded by sea .
So uh in that way it 's uh really interesting uh to visit and uh to leave an experience in it .
Uh in brief , it 's um historical and modern city at the sam - same time and uh it 's unusual it has an unusual beauty uh after all .
