Chance to become what I want to , I 'd like to become a professor in the field of my study , which is architecture .
Firstly , because I think I like to interact with students .
I have I like to accumulate lot of knowledge and then give it to um next generation .
That is something I really want to do .
I want to be in a position where I can influence society and I can and what can be better than influencing young minds of future .
This is a very respectable profession and something very close to my heart .
I have been seeing my professors and their lifestyle which really inspires to me uh inspires me to be like them .
Um I like the way they conduct informal dinners and everything for students , they way they interact and their poise .
That 's what I want to be .
