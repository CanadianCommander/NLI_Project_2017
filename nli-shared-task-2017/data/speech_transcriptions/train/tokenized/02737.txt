When I 'm away uh I miss a lot uh for uh two couple of things .
One thing is that my the food , my nation food .
My city of uh the food of my city and of course my parents .
In the first thing is my my the food .
I love Paella it is the most uh typical in here in in Valencia okay and on the other hand my parents .
I I love this uh confidence with them .
For this reason I love it , they had to to keep in touch .
Sometimes I am desperate uh uh thinking about this couple of things but in conclusion the food and parents is the most important thing I I miss when I am away .
