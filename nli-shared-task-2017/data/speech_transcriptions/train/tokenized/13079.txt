A special opportunity was given to me by The Foundation Program that started um , that that started like fourteen months ago .
Um it 's a program that um gives young professionals the opportunity to go to a different country but they first go for four months to school and after work , afterwards they stay with the company for um a whole year where they can um gain um working experience .
I not only gain work experience but I also improved my English skills and I met a lot of new people and um , also um got to know the American culture better .
