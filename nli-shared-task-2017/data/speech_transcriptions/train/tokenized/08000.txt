A great opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity to study uh to go to school high school for this in the United States for one year , it 's a part of an exchange program .
It was very important to me personally looking back now uh about six years spend since I 've been there and it 's been very important to me .
One is because it uh enabled me to learn about other culture and it really influenced me actually right now looking to go back to college in the United States and also it was a great opportunity to meet uh to meet different people .
So I talk or chat list in today and I visited after uh two years ago .
So I mean it 's important to me to mature as a person .
