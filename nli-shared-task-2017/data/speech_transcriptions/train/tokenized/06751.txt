I begin first a team member should be responsibility this is because to look after his work , his own work and the work of other people in his own team .
He also he , the members will also have to be a good communicator , a good communicator .
He should be able to convey ideas clearly and lastly I think the individual must to be a great motivator as he has to move other people to reach their goals of the team .
He also has to be uh a very good negotiator because he will be in charge , he is probably would be in charge of going to negotiate deals with other groups of people .
