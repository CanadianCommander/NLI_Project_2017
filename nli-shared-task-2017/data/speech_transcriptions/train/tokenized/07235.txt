Last year I got that special opportunity to uh come here in Alabama to work for company name uh Vicat , which is national cement here in Alabama .
I did my uh education my bachelor degree in engineering in mechanical and uh I really enjoy today because I get good score and I was working up there in Canada for another cement company when one day I got a phone call from a that was looking for somebody like me and somebody who can speak French like I do because that 's uh French company .
So I finally came here and take this opportunity uh in good sense .
