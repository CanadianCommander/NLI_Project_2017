That is one of the best university of the Spain .
And all I really thanks for them um I am , I am studying uh my degree of economics but it is a degree bilingual .
It is in , in English and I think that uh language is a very important uh nowadays .
So is important to uh know some languages and go out to another places , another country to blow your mind and to meet new .
