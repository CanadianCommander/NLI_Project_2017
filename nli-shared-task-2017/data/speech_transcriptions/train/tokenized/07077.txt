Back when I was in high school when I was uh about sixteen or fifteen years old , my school gave me the opportunity uh to go and spend a month in San Francisco in a , in a family there .
And it was great for me because I had the opportunity of um meeting great people and living in the United State for a month which was a very rich experience for me .
It 's something I had never done before , um and it helped me improve my English .
Um and when I was there I I attended school there and I had the opportunity of studying topics that I could n't study here in France and that was great .
