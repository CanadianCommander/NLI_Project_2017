Uh if a friend of mine would come to uh would come to my country I would uh advice them to see uh Istanbul uh because it 's a very nice city and it 's a city blessed with a natural history at the same .
Uh and uh there is the Bosphorus uh which is like a bridge between Asia and Europe and uh this makes Istanbul is a very nice and interesting place to see and once more , uh it has a hot climate in every season you can uh you can go anywhere you want and it 's a nice city blessed with nature .
Uh I can say that it 's the uh one of the most uh historical places uh in the world and um that 's why I would like them to see Istanbul .
It 's very nice and a historical city .
