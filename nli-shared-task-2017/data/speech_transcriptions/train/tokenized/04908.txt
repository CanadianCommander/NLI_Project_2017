I actually prefer reading magazines and books dealings with topics about society like uh with my stuff like that .
Uh so you can actually see that my hobby is also my profession because I like to stu - I actually study sociology so like reading my free times books which are closely linked to my studies and to my interest .
So um yeah there is nothing very specific I like uh other people have like uh try to read something separating their free time than what they are doing as their profession .
