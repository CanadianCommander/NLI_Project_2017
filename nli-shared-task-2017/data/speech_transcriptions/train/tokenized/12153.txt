Uh in the , in the summer I was doing my training in the America and I , my professor gave me project work that was in a very beginning stage .
And because of the beginning stage , very few return , very few information was available .
So I have to work very hard to start on the project .
I conte - I went to the library uh , I searched a lot of books .
And but it , that project was very important for me because this was a part of my summer training and I was very meticulous and I was uh taking the project to take uh responsibility for my higher studies the next spring .
