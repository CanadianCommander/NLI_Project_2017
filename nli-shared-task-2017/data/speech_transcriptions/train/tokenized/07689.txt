I 'm by nature a ve - a very veracious reader .
Uh I have read text based in fiction and in fact and begin my day everyday with by reading the newspaper .
Um I like to be aware of uh events going on around me and I am especially keen on reading uh books of my uh Latin American fiction such as those by Gabriel Garcia Marquez .
Although I have breadth of knowledge uh that I have gained from reading uh even classical text such as Ulysses and the Odyssey .
Uh I believe that reading narrowly educates a person but also cultivates a personality .
