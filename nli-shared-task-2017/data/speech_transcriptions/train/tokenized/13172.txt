If I could have any job or career that I wanted I would definitely want to become a software developer .
I really like being the software developer because I enjoy coding and working in IT development world .
I working with business analysts and taking their ideas and putting them into a software field that into a picture when the screen shows up and it 's really nice to work it .
I have been working in the software field for a long time and I would love to just stay in that and really create wonderful things .
So I would really like being in the computer world .
