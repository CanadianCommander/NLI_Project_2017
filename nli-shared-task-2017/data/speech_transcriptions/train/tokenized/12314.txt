I was given the incredible opportunity to um the team of drafts - draftsmen which is si - six thousand miles away from Paris because it 's located in Pune India .
Pune is a kind of Indian Silicon Valley .
My task was to make them uh do the different drawings on uh an engineering study but uh Indian people had no training that .
So I had to make them improve um their engineering skills .
Consequently , it helped me in understanding their culture which is different from mine .
