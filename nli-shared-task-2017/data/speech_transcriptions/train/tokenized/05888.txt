An interesting book that I have read recently is The Doomsday Conspiracy written by Sidney Sheldon .
I found this book to be very interesting .
In fact , I could n't put the book down until the last page .
The way the characters have been portrayed is very exemplary especially the character of the main person is dully portrayed .
And theme is so nicely explain certain situation when writing .
It made me feel as if I 'm into the book and I 'm one of those characters and there are people behind me .
So I feel this book is very interesting .
