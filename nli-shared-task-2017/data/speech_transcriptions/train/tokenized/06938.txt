If friends abroad come to my country I would suggest them to visit Istanbul because Istanbul is the largest city of Turkey .
And it is a very old city , so it has much very much historical places .
Um and uh they can walk from Europe to Asia in Istanbul on the Bosporus bridge .
And the Bo-Bosporus bridge view is very good they would like to see it and there are many enjoyable places in Istanbul such as bars and pubs .
