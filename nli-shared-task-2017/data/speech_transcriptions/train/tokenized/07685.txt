Uh I miss a lot of things uh about my home when I 'm uh away at work or uh away traveling to a different country .
Uh first thing that I miss are my parents a lot uh uh because uh I have at least stayed close to them close to them since my childhood .
I also miss uh my mother 's cooking a lot uh because the most uh most of the times when I travel out uh I have to eat out and uh miss home cooked food .
Um I also miss my beds a lot uh because uh since childhood I 've been extremely close to them and uh whenever I travel I tend to uh feel connected to them .
