The most important accomplishment in my career was to be admitted in a PhD program in Constitutional and Comparative Law at Piezas University in my country .
It was very important because the admission process is very selective and only a few of the most prepared graduates are admitted each year .
Furthermore , it was important because being admitted into this program represents a great opportunity to boost my career as an international lawyer .
