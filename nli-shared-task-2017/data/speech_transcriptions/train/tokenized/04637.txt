When , when um I 'm away from home , I first miss uh my familiar objects .
Familiar objects like my bed , my uh , my uh phone and et cetera .
Whereas my familiar objects I am used to I 'm , I 'm used to , to do every time the same thing the same , and I know the problem I should have with them .
And so when uh I take those objects I do n't uh know what uh what problem may happen .
And the second thing is uh all the familiar activities I know that um at uh at seven o'clock , my mother always come home to prepare the dinner etcetera .
