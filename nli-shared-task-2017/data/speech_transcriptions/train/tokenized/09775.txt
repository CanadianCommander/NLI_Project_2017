Only the people I miss more are my family and my friends .
Uh I really miss my family normally because I miss living with them and uh I 'm used to the habit I have in my family .
I miss also my friends because I see them everyday and they support me in my everyday life .
Moreover I miss food usually when I 'm abroad because food in Italy my native country is usually better than abroad .
This means every time I travel I usually have a problem that I do n't find the food I 'm used .
So , I really miss my habits .
