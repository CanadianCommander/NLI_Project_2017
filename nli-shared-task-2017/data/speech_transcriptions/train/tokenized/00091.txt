Uh read novels in my spare time because reading novels is good rela - good kind of be relaxation and because of two reasons .
The first is that uh the novels uh is often uh portray many different kinds of aspects , aspects of in our social lives .
This is very great and reach our minds and broaden our horizon .
We a lot of things that are kind of in your own that are kind of our experience .
Moreover , um the many are imaginary .
They can make me think of a thing that uh does n't happen and we realize uh make me curious and then make me interesting .
