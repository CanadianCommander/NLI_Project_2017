I prefer reading scientific materials especially those to my field of study .
Actually I find those stuff very interesting to me as they increase my knowledge about my field and they also improve my practice my professional practice and I can explore the new experiments in whatever new journals and new topics that are discovered about my practice .
I always search for these topics online on the journals and uh text books available online .
