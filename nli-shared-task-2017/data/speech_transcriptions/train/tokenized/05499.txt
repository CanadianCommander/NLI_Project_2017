Years ago and I had the opportunity to go in Germany for one year .
Uh it was a very good opportunity for me because uh uh thanks to these year I was uh able to speak German currently .
And uh it rose me to discover the the ways of German live and the way they eat the way they use maybe public transport and so um I found these experience very interesting and uh it was very important for me .
