Definitely I would suggest him to visit BogotÃ ¡ .
The reason is because BogotÃ ¡ is such a good city if you are coming to see a place you can visit a lot of museums .
We have the Gold museum that is really good , we have a lot of restaurants so if you are wondering about what to eat you have a lot of places you can choose from .
Also there has been a lot of cultural things to do .
You have concerts , you have night life that is very important , and you have a lot of places where you can go and dance and have fun .
So I will definitely tell them that they ha - if they are coming to visit they should and they must come to BogotÃ ¡ where they will enjoy very much .
