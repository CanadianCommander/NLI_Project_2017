The book I think is most interesting is Guitar .
Uh it is a part of the famous poem which was written by great poet Wade < % 19.1 > .
I find it very interesting .
It is , is , it is very useful in life .
It contains all what Lord Krishna said to Arjuna , hello , during his battle , which is name as Mahabharat , in which Arjuna has to face his friends , his relatives .
