The most interesting book I have ever read is the book The Perfume by Patrick Suskind .
The book is about a young man who has a very good nose and who is creating new perfumes for the highest society .
I have read this book in school and it really kept with me because of some reasons .

Furthermore , I like the book because it chose the career of a very poor child .
This shows that you can achieve anything you want if you 're fascinated by it .
