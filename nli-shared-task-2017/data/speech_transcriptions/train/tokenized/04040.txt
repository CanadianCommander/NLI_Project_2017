In my opinion leadership is a quality that makes someone valuable member of a team .
This is because a leader will always lead a team the right direction and at the right uh uh time .
Uh he will take the team his in the team and manage the team with the right resources and the right uh material that uh team is who made to work with the project .
A leader should be knowing all the information and uh uh details that that him has to make uh a leader should also have a lot of man - management qualities in him so that he relates to each member of a team in in a relative way .
Where each member is refereed .
