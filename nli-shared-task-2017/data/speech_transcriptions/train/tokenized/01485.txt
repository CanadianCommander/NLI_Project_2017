When I could choose what I wanted to be I think I would be a Computer Engineer because uh first uh I like computers , I like everything that has something to do with computers , with technology and on general .
Um well apart from that , I think that money would also be quite important because um well with money you can do a lot of stuff maybe like some family or something like that .
Um well about my interest about computers , I like to play with computers , I also to all the technical details of computers .
Um I like very much to play what I said right now but I also like everything with new technology .
