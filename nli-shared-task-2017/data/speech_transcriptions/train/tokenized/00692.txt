Now I 'm living in London and away from my parents .
I use to live in Lacoronia in Spain .
So what I most uh missed of my house with my parents are actually my parents are my family .
I really miss talking to them when I got back from work and having these nice conversations .
Then there are other things like I , that I also missed and missed .
Like for example , the food I had ready in the table .
My clothes folded on the bed when I come back .
Um the you know have everything clean without doing the laundry .
Uh all the really comfortable couch that I can see the TV .
So you know have a big space for to walk around et cetera .
I also miss the .
