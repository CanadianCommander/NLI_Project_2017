I miss many things when I 'm away from my home which include my loving family my my my father and mother , and my mother who cooks well and prepares me the food which I want and the the food I miss when I 'm away from my family .
And also the creek which is near to my hometown in which I get very different types of , different types of enjoyment in the form of negative and positive .
In that which include when I go to the creek when I put my feel into the water I get the chilled feeling and also9 when I when my face exposes to sun I get the feeling of heating , so that is what I miss .
