When I 'm away I usually miss my family , that 's my mother , my father and my three brothers .
I often use uh I often miss my , the food my mother prepares .
She 's a very good cook and she does a lot of deserts such as cake , pies and other stuff .
Uh I would also miss my dogs , Johny , Murphy and the whole bunch of them because they are truly cute and very handsome to me , the human being .
Another thing I will miss is of course my house is very big and very comfortable and it gives a lot of pleasure to be living in it .
