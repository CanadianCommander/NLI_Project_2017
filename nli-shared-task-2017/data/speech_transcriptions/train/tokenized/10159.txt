Always I 'm away the person I miss most definitely my mum .
First because my mum is the first person I met in my life and is she taught me to scramble to walk and to sp - to speak .
And also during my childhood is also my mum who take care of me sitting besides my bed .
And finally whenever I fail in a really important event like the TOEFL , IIBT iT 's my mum who cheer me up and take up my confidence again .
And so my mum is really important to me I 'll definitely miss her .
