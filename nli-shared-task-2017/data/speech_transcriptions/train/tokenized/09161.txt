Well , according to me a leader of a group in the first place should have trust within the people within his group , because a group is n't called a group until it ha - , until there is a little bit of trust among all the members .
He should also have certain leadership qualities like not to be you know short-minded or something , so as he , he not lose temper immediately and to believe and to , and to have faith within his co-workers and not to , never under - , underestimate his co-workers .
Uh he should also have a quality such as honesty to be always fra - , frank and to always share and express his views clearly and , and should work more like a family than , than a group .
