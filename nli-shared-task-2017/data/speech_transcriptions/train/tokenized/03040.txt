My special opportunity that was given to me was that I could come to America to go to high school .
The first reason is because I can learn English , English is becoming such a popular in the world it , everyone should learn English .
And second reason is because I could learn culture in the United States if I 'm in Japan I could only learn Japanese culture .
And the third reason is to get experience that I can not get in Japan , if I 'm an ordinary student in Japan I will never get the , such a wonderful experience in the American high school as American high school student .
