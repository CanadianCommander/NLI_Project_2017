I would like to read magazine mostly during my free time because I prefer magazines to novels and uh other poetry items because I can gain knowledge over the wide range of topics which can help update myself about the current topics and various events and most often they are more cheaper than the novels .
Also they help in improving the my communication skills and I can gain uh wide range of knowledge on various topics and I can even do the projects that talk about in the magazines .
That 's the reason why I prefer magazines to novels .
And poetry , I 'm not interested in poetry so I pick up uh magazine instead of poetry and .
