The last book I read was the book of a criminal story .
I really ca n't uh remember the the title but it uh dealt with a murder that did n't really could um identify as the murderer at first and like the whole the whole story just just uh felt with the with the um reading and the book because at first you thought that she might be the victim but at the end she 's she was the murderer of all the people there .
Really the story .
Um in general I I really like female stories like the old English from Agatha Cristie with the detectives and thus I love that it 's really like interesting for me .
