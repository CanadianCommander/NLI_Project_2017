The special opportunity that was given to me was was coming to in America .
Um it was a special opportunity because it provided me to learn a different uh language and it pr - it , it helped me to learn about different culture and customs which I never experienced in Japan .
Um coming to America also was new experiences I went to many different kind of school that I was in then in Japan .
And I experienced eating different kind of food which I never ate , which I never also ate in Japan .
Um and also many friends and um I really like the opportunity that I was given because it 's special .
