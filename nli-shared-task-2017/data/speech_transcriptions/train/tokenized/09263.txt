The most interesting book I have ever read is a book in C. It is a book in C programming and because I have read uh several book in C programming , uh the special about this book it is it is the easiest and it is it talks about the topics contained in the most easiest way than they they I read it ever .
So I enjoyed it because the author was strong and he wrote his ideas very clear .
