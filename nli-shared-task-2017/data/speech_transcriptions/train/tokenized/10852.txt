I like reading novel .
I like reading about it but especially novels I like most .
And it 's because I can experience other people 's lives and I can learn a lot from their lives .
Um experience they had is something I 'd never have in my future .
So in a novel I can be a mother or even a father and it 's really nice to see world differently and different from what I see now and I like it .
That 's all .
