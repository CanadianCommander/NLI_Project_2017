For me the uh accomplishment that I 've , uh that required me to work very hard uh is to actually to bridge the gap between um friends be my family members .
Uh what I usually do when I have felt I was hurt by people I know is that I just turn away , I walk way and I never get to contact with them anymore .
But uh I think in accomplishment that I did was try to bridge these kind of gaps and it 's really important to me because um even now it was important to me because if I had n't done that then I would n't , would n't have to , I would n't have .
