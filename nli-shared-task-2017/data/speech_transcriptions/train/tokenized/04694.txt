The special opportunity I had is the to study my master degree in United States .
In this period , I can meet a lot of provisioned professors who give us a lot of formal training and education and help me to understand a lot of naval techniques in biotechnology and they they also help me to prepare me for the entering of advanced PHD degree study .
So I appreciate this chance .
