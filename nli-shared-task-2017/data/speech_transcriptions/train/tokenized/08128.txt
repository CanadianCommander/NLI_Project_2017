The interesting book that I have ever read is Cinderella and main reasons I can go to state this was the book that was gifted to me by my father , the first book during my childhood .
The difficulties that uh Cinderella faced during her childhood really made cry because I did n't know that it was a story and always I used to feel it was a real story .
But later when I knew it was a fantasy I was really surprised .
Cinderella is a sad story full of fantasies .
As a child I was uh I , I liked fantasies so this book was very interesting .
Uh in Cinderella the story is mainly about a girl who faces a lot of problems because of her stepmother .
Her stepmother uh she is too uh always treat her bad so in such cases I feel that this book is more interesting .
