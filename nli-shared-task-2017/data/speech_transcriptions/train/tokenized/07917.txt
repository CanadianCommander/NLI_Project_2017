Reading is a habit that not only enhances one 's knowledge , but also at the same time gives you the recreation .
Personally I like reading magazines and novels particularly architecture magazines are more interest of uh are of more interest to me because architecture is my field .
So being an architect , it adds to my knowledge and I come to know about the various upcoming materials and the design elements .
Apart from that I also like reading biographies of great people as they inspire me a lot and help me to state my life philosophies .
Detective novels are again one thing which adds to my interest because they create , they have a spice of mystery in them which help .
