Well I 'm from France , so the first place I would like him to visit would be Paris I guess um he could go a city Eiffel tower and the and enjoy uh nice walk uh along the , along the sand , sorry .
And the second place that I would suggest him to go would be Bordeaux which is my city .
Uh in Bordeaux which is in south west France you can access the sea in about forty minutes drive , uh the Atlantic coast .
Then you yo can go skiing in the winter in the then you can enjoy um very good wine and very good food , um that is about it .
