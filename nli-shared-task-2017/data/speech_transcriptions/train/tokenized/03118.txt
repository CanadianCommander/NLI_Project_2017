I like reading the newspaper early because it allows you to take a break from your studies so the material you are reading for university .
Furthermore reading the newspaper is interesting because you can keep in touch with the world news and your country news and in addition I find it interesting because there is a section dedicated to shows in my town so I can I can um have information about what shows are on on the same day or night and read in the newspaper .
So I can organize my my my going out with the newspaper .
