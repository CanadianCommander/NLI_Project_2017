I think um the fact that I miss the most when I 'm away from home is my father .
I was living for one year in the United States and I missed him a lot .
I also missed my friends and the food , the food in Spain it 's a lot better than the United States for me .
Uh I also missed a lot the way of life here because there they have another time to have lunch , have dinner and uh they also add to other things to have fun like going a lot to the cinema and they even go to bars or discos .
