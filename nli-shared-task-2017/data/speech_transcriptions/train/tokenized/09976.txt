The most important thing that I miss when I 'm away from home is my family , my parents , my brother .
And mixed with that I miss food I uh normally eat homemade food and I do n't really like the food that is available in the restaurant and all especially uh made I love the food made by my mother .
So I feel she is one of the best cooks in the world .
And second finally , the one I miss most is my room .
My I love sleeping on my bed because uh it 's really good uh sleeping on my bed .
I love this and most I miss my pet as well , I miss him when I 'm away my doggy .
