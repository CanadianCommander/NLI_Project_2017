To tell you the truth I do n't get much time too much free time to read on my free time although I go to the beach and when I 'm in the beach I enjoy reading novels and magazines .
Well the type of novels that I read are basically Latin American writers such as Mario Vargas Jorge also Davil Garcia Marquez , these are novels that are that are stories about Latin American politics .
The other thing that I read are magazines and newspapers I find them very interesting because they keep me up to date with the information .
