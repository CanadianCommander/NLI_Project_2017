I think a quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team is uh ability an ability to socialize with people because it is important skill to make a team to be in a group that they can continue to work together and in my experience I , once from the club in school and it was hard for me to lead all the people while people had different opinions on the um uh problems so if they could socialize and discuss more better , they would be better .
