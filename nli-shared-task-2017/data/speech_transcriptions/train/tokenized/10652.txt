I miss most about my home when I was always my parents love .
I stayed at home up to my tenth class and then I left home for my higher studies but then I missed that my parent 's love every time .
They love me a lot and I do love them a lot .
The relationship between me and my parents are is can not be expressible .
My parents bought me everything when I was twelve so even if I ask for very costly thing they will bring me and they treated me very well , they cherish me a lot .
