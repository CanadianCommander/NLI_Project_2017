What I miss most about when I 'm away home .
The first reasons I miss my mother 's home made food that no one can even possibly think of making same taste like her , uh that 's impossible of my taste from my own .
And the second reason why uh what I miss most from away from the home is my couch .
It is so comfortable that I could just sit and lay around all long .
And well to say about my mother 's food more , it 's very tasty and special and for these reasons I , those two are what I miss the most when I 'm away from my home .
