Actually I miss uh pretty the most about my home , and it 's my mother .
Every time I 'm out with my friends and gathering , we 're gathering is um I feel like I want to go home as soon as possible to go and sit with my mum and have a chit-chat with her before she goes to bed .
Because um I 've been studying abroad for a while and uh it was hard for me to stay all alone without her .
And the whole , whole family actually .
So now that I 'm back , every time I go out because I 'm fearing to back home and not find her awake or anybody is or able to sit um .
I feel like I have n't seen her and I really want to go home .
In addition to that I like my bed because it resembles rest .
