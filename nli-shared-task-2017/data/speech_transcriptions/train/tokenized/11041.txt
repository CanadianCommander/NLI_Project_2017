Last week , I was provided a very special opportunity .
I could record a commercial for an American company that uh wants to sell a product in Germany and they needed a native German speaker for this .
And yes uh this was the first time I was in a special voice record studio and the experience was very interesting and I have heard the first time , for the first time how my voice uh sounds to other people and I really had fun doing this .
And um yeah I would like to do it um another time that is a nice new opportunity to make some money .
