Once as I was small my grandfather took me with him to the opera .
It was a special opportunity for me because I love music and he always , before he always took my big sister to things like that .
Also , the opera is a very thing do and um I was the first time , it was the first time where when I could go somewhere without my parents so that was very special for me .
Also , my grandmother gave me money um for to buy popcorn in the break and it was so interesting to see all those people in these nice skirts and all with the nice expensive clothes as it was really overwhelming for me .
