Um an interesting book that I have read recently is by Orhan Pamuk .
Uh he 's the noble prize winner of this year and uh the book 's name is My Name Is Red .
It is about a prism painter and I could relate the uh the experience of the painter to my own because uh I I also am a painter and um I do feel the conflict between the western kind of painting and the traditional Korean kind of painting .
Therefore the book left a very strong impression on me .
