I think you will ask the question uh when you ask me such a question I will definitely answer it as uh novels .
But uh I do n't like to read novels which are about social events or or romance .
Uh my novels are usually uh cultural , politic and historical .
Uh I do n't like to read magazines uh and poetry uh because I 'm not a romantic person uh and that 's wh - that 's why when I read poetry uh I can find something in myself so I do n't like to read poetry and uh when coming to magazines uh .
