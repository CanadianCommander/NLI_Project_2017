I guess I have different answers depending on where is the country where I am at .
Uh obviously if I 'm in a cold country I 'm going to miss the weather that we have in my city which pretty warm during the spring and summer and is kind of cold in the winter but I like it .
Uh if I 'm in uh which is known for not having the best food for especially for students uh people with a very small budget I would probably miss the tapas uh culture .
Tapas are a free food that we have here in when you order a drink .
Uh well definitely I will miss my family and friends , that 's something that uh is given for sure so that 's it .
