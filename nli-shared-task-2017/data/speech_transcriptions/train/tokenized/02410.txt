Italy is such a countries , country you can have uh monumental cities like Rome , Florence and Milan .
And you can also have places where you can spend time having uh a nice weather or uh nice landscapes .
So I would suggest them to come to Rome first of all to see all the history that is here all the big monuments and all the nice place .
But I also suggest them to go to Florence where also a big of our Italians part history part is .
But also to go maybe in the south where they can have nice weather nice sea and nice sun .
