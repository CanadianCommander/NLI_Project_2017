I 'm from India .
As every knows that uh the climate in India is awesome , is sunny and hot and I miss the climate most .
And apart from the climate , I miss my family as I stay alone here and working for the NHS .
I miss my head family as well and the foods which my cooks , I think is the best and I miss the food as well .
And my and I also miss other younger brother who is seventeen years and we play , we used to play together when we were at home and I think I miss all of them the family , the food and the climate as well .
