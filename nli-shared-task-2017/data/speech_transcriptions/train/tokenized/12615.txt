I 'm going to talk about uh an opportunity that was given to me to work in a jewelery store .
I think it was really special because it gave the chance to be an assistant manager and it gave me the chance to practice what I want to do in the future because I want to be manager .
And it was so special because I used to work in toy store and in I did really like it , so because um this opportunity was special because the , the salary was more , they gave me more money and um , um .
