It 's uh I studied back , back in United States in Baltimore so I miss a lot of about my family and my fam - family traditions , visiting my uncles and aunts and stuff like that .
And also the most , the most important thing that miss about is my mum 's food and the traditional Turkish food that she has cooked for us always .
And also uh we have some uh really good connections with some friends and social activities we share with them .
And that 's also the most important part of the uh , most important cycle of my life .
And uh I also , I also miss the home concerts you know .
