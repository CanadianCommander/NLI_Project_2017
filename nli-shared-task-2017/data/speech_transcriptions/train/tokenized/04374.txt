This opportunity that I 'm going to tell you about uh given by my mom because she gives a musical workshop and she gave me the opportunity to be part of this workshop .
And , and thanks to her I 've been able to practice my music um with a - adults uh which I never did before so it uh it was um , it was a good thing for me uh in a human point of view because I learned how to really have a good communication with them and from the musical point of view because I had to sing in public and uh I had to do that freely with my own also being heard by everyone which I rarely do .
