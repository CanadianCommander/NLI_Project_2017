An interesting book I read was about history of journalism .
It was written by a professor at the university .
It was certainly interesting because it detail about the progression that journalism have through history .
Uh uh and giving an ex - example on this is about many different writer and what kind of style. , what kind of situation they describe .
It was an extremely interesting book .
He c - he could uh describe the progression on journalism through history and it was also giving uh a lot of details about the most important journalist uh in the history of journalism .
I really appreciated how the professor managed also to convey some kind of uh transformation through the progression of journalism .
He highlighted how journalism is kind of losing this , its role of witness - .
