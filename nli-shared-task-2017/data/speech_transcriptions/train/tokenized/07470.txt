Uh in my opinion I believe what makes uh member a a person a valuable member in a team is basically four character that I 've men - I will mention .
First of all is patience and the member of team you have to show some patience in order like to make the uh the team work , you also need to be hard workers in a way that uh you have to participate not just to be like a freeloader in a team but to bring new ideas to show that uh you really involved int he group .
And one of the four um um quality that a member should uh uh uh a person in a group should show is to be uh valuable to show that the at a certain time when the group needs you to be there you have to be there you know uh .
