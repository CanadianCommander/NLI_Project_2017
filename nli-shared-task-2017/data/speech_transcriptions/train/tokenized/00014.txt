An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was to secure a seat for myself in the course of engineering .
I remember , I used to work very hard for this .
I I had to spend at least twelve hours while I was preparing for engineering and in this accomplishment of mine was very important to me because throughout my childhood , I had the ambition of uh becoming a good engineer and this means a lot to me and the accomplishment really uh paid off because I I got admitted in one of the best institutes in my state and I 'm happy with what I 'm doing and quite content with whatever I 've accomplished so far .
