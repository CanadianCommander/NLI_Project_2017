The accomp - the accomplishment I was really proud of was the national debate competition I anticipate during my high school years .
Um debate was not only about performance on stage but also about information gath - um information gathering and team work before that contest .
And the reason why it is so important to me is because I learned so much about to tal - communication because communication is not only um listen um not about speaking but also about listen as well because you have to be aware of what your opponents the uh the questions your opponent throw out to you and you have think about it and then give the best answer to your opponents and that you can win the contest .
