Uh the most thing that I miss when I 'm away from my home uh is my friends .
Uh usually uh I 'm always with them , uh I the going out , so whenever I go out of my country I really have feel that I miss them .
Uh other thing is my family , uh we are a huge family uh a lot of uh brothers and sisters .
So usually when I go out of my country we do n't go as a family , so I keep missing the , the other part of my family who stayed in the country .
