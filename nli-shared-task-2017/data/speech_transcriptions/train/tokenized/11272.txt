Since I 'm from a town that 's I miss the most the beach .
I love the beach , I love sunbathing and I love just relaxing and chilling there with my friends .
I also miss the views I have from my house because my house it 's in the ninth floor , so I see all the bay from my window and I can also see from my house .
I miss that 's and I also miss people because people there is very happy is very open minded and they do n't care what you 're doing , anytime you can do whatever you want and you do not have to worry what will they be thinking the next day .
I also love it 's it 's weather .
