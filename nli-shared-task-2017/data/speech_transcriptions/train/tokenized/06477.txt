I 'd like to invite friends from another country to the city Sapporo and Hakodate in Japan .
The first reason I believe is that Hako - that Sapporo is the best place to visit is because although it 's a cold city .
There are many delicious food and such as crops , shrimps and so uh food makes people food makes people happy so then I think it is the best place .
Also there are there are many architecture , people who are interested in history can visit so that they are fulfilled with excitement of history .
