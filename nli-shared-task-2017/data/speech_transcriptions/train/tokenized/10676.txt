When I am away from my house the thing I miss most is my family .
Well I have six brothers and I have a very good relationship with them .
So when I am away I you know , feel little bad because I 'm used to stay with the them everyday at every time so them and also I miss my parents because I also have a good relation with them and at least I would like to mention that I also miss you know , my room and my you know , my computer , my music and all those kinds of things .
The , no that 's all .
