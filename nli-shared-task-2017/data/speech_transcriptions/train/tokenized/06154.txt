Well I 'll talk about the last favorite .
It 's called The and I found it very interesting because uh first of all it was the first uh first book I read by an Italian author < % > actually and uh uh is is the that 's why I found it very interesting because I have uh I have before I had no no exposure to Italian uh literature literature .
The second reason I found it uh interesting is because it has it was full of flashbacks and this is uh what I love in in reading or in reading in stories or seeing in movies and the the third and the most important reason I found it interesting was because it 's it 's also full of conspiracy theories which is uh which is something I really love .
