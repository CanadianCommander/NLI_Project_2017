The special opportunity that was given for me was in my school days .
I was um taken , I was uh I was given a chance to participate in the scouts and uh during my school days .
It was a special opportunity because during those days I learned how , how to make my self confidence and how to make things move plan .
I think this was very important because it improved my confidence .
The task which were carried during the training uh process of and < % 29.0 > were the individual tasks .
So I had to do it myself and this boosted my confidence and not only this the task were also be meant to do in a planned time .
So I came to know the importance of time during that period .
