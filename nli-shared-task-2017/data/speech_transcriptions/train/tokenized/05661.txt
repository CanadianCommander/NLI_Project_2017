It happened this summer when I had my first work experience in London , I get to prepare a presentation to pro - a presentation to explain in front of a lot of people and it was the first time to for me for me to to face a situation like this .
I get to prepare this kind of presentation with a lot of slides and the most difficult things was to really speak in front of an audience but the mean time it was very good experience for me because it was my first experience at work and I had the possibility to had the possibility to focus that were very hard on the first time in their life .
