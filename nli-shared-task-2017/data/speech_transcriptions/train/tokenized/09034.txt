A special opportunity that was given to me this year , was my prefectship at my school since I go to a boarding school it gives me an opportunity to show my leadership and help me take responsibility and to show the school and the dorm parents and the students what I really am made of and it gives me the good experience so when I go off to college or when I have time of my own I can take better responsibility for myself and to have a good experience in being able to .
