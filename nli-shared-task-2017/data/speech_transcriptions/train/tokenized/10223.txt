I like to read scientific books like history or uh about politicians about , about uh politicians like < % > or the Iranian stuff like that .
Because I think uh these guys changed something but it 's not all the time but we think yeah it should not happen again .
So I think we should learn something out of this uh of the history for out future .
And uh so we can change our reality with this knowledge .
