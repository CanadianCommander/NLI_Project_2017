Well I 've stayed away from home for quite a few years and the one one thing that I miss the most about home is the familiar surroundings which I 'm so used to , the warmth and the care of the people around me , my parents , my friends and obviously when I stay alone I have to take decisions on my own without consulting anybody around me .
That again inculcates a sense of responsibility in me but I do miss it at times when certain decisions could be taken with the actions of my parents and one thing that I definitely miss about home is good food .
The the way my grandparents and pa - parents .
