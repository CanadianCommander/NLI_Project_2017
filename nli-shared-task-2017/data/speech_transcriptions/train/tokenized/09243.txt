The most thing I usually miss is my family because I have a little nephew .
He 's quite sweet and uh I like it very much to play with him and also the rest of my family is very important for me .
So I miss them very much and I feel very good contact of them and uh yes , this is why I miss them .
The second thing are my friends in my hometown .
I remember at home , uh I sometimes used to go out with them to make uh party with them or something like this .
The last thing I miss is the region where I come from , where I feel at home because yes , this is my home and I yeah .
