I miss my family and friends and school games , TV , my parents ; many things when I 'm away from home .
Most importantly I miss my family ; my sisters , my parents , my mother , mum and dad .
I 've been living away from home for around five or six years .
Though I 've got used to it when I , though I 've got used to it I still have n't adjusted to living away from home .
I , I often talk to my family , my sisters and parents on cellphone or by landline phone , but I do miss them even though I can talk with them .
Uh I miss them .
