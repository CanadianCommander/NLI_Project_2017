I think someone is a valuable member of a team when he can share and communicate on information for example .
If you 're working as a team in a in a class work or in laboratory work , when you have to this you have to share all the information you 've got in order to uh look for the same objective to look to look for um be able to let 's say uh increase the team expectations .
You do n't have to be abusive also and you also need um to share all information that you 've got .
One thing is that you have to communicate completely well and also um to avoid them .
