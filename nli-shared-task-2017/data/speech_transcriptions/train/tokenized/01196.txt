If I could have any job or career I wanted , I would choose um funeral director because this is the job my parents do and we have funeral home .
And so it was for me clear all my life that I want to do this because you can help people and you meet a lot of people and you can go really new ways and in our company we go new ways and this is such a great feeling to see people and to see the people , how thankful they are for our work .
And so I think this is the greatest job I can think of .
