Very interesting piece of literature I 've been reading recently is definitely Lord of the Rings by J. R. Tolkein .
I like the way he made up this uh really fantastic world and all the creatures that live in this world .
And what 's uh , what 's fascinating about all these creatures is he , the author really made up societies with different uh structures and different uh uh characteristics and it 's it 's very very interesting to explore how he , how how he did this and what he uh what abilities he gave these characters .
And also there 's a lot of tension in it , to mention this finally uh because there is a task to finish .
