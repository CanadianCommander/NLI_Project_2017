Uh I miss a lot about my home whenever I 'm away from it because uh I mainly miss the care and affection which I get from my parents and the help which they really do whenever I 'm at home because they do n't allow me to do anything .
They see to that their child is secured and she does her work that help me in all my activities .
In fact they pamper me a lot anything and I miss that a lot because whenever I 'm I 'm away from home I 'm made to do all my works .
I accept that I 'll get the independent thing and independent thought and everything .
I have to do everything by my own .
It helps me to an extent but I then I miss my parents because I happily with them and I feel homesick whenever I I re - remember them .
