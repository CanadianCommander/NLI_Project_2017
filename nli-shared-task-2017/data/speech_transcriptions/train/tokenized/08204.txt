Special opportunity that was given to me uh was when I was in my country India .
I was a teacher and um I was asked to direct a play .
The head of the department was on a sick leave so I had to take over .
During uh the entire uh month that we practiced and had rehearsals , uh what I felt was that there was a stronger bond between myself and my students .
It is very important for uh students as well as the teacher to know each other personally and to come closer .
There was a lot of learning .
