According to me , the biggest quality of somebody who wants to be a valuable member of the team is is the ability to influence people in a good or a team .
Uh I think so because uh if the person does n't have the ability to influence other people then he will be p - uh probably led by what the group is doing and he 'll be in a less of a position .
He 'll be in a uh in a position where he will be going be the team and he 'll not be able to contribute much to the group as a whole .
His contributions mainly will be influenced by his ability to influence the team to uh follow of certain direction and to towards uh second chosen .
Thank you .
