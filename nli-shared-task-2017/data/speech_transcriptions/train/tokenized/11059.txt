I think the important quality for a team or group member to have is to be honesty .
Um because I think in people 's relationship honest is very important stuff between each people to each other .
Uh if you play somethi - someone 's word and you and uh he believed you and you can get nowhere because you blame each other .
So I think the most important thing is the honest , anyway I think some uh it 's also it 's important to know what each other like by that .
