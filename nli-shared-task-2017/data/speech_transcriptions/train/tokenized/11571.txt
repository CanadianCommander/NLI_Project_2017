If you need to work very hard I will suggest three things are important .
The , the first one is confident .
When you are , when you are full of confidence , you are willing to do something in your work very hard .
And the second thing is put your all , your efforts into that work .
If you do n't try hard , if you do n't try hard enough , you ca n't work very hard in your work .
And the most im - and the finally the most important thing is to schedule your time properly .
If you do not know , if you do n't know to how to use your time , you can not be work hard .
