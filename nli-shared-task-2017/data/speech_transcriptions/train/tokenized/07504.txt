I have the opportunity to go and visit um different countries during the summer , and this opportunity was important to me because I got to learn different cultures and I got to be with different people .
And this experience really taught me a lot .
And the time I spent with the people and the time I spent learning the culture and all the experiences in different countries have really given me the opportunity to um to experience life in different countries and understand different cultures and people .
