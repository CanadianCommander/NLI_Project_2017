What I miss most about being back home is hanging out with my friend friends , my family because this and uh relaxation you feel when being around the loved ones and your closer people the the feeling of belonging to specific environment .
This is where you were born , this is where you , you have to live .
So it 's actually just this feeling of family and respect and uh being adapted to specific situation which you live in .
And you know the atmosphere the sceneries of the country , the coziness being not doing everything you 'd like to do without being bothered .
