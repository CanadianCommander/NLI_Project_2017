My interest that I have ever read is the Positive Thinking which is written by Napoleon Hill .
And uh from this book we can learn to improve our positive thinking in a gradual way and he he helps us to improve our positive thinking in steps by giving the live examples and one of the example I read was inspired by reading this book was the night when one of my friend was uh feeling very depressed about his situation in his in the academic profile .
And I gave him this book and he um showed to improve his thinking towards a positive in a gradual way and that is why I was interested .
