After my marriage I went abroad .
When I was away from home , I felt very much sad and upset of my condition .
This was mainly because I missed my mom 's love and affection , she was very much caring and she made the food whatever I like and she never said no to me , she was very much cooperative with me .
I also lost so much of my friends contacts and because of that I felt all alone in abroad .
So whenever I call her to her home , I just speak about my past and my time I spend with my parents and I really loved those times .
Those memories carries in me for alway everlasting and it will be pleasant .
