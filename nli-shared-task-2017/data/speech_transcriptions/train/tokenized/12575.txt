When I 'm away from my home I miss my parents and my friends the most .
Parents always have been the guiding light and I miss their advices at each and every moment of my life .
Being away from home into a new country will always make me miss my culture .
The time-the trends we follow in our country are different from the trends followed in other countries .
Away from home I will miss the food the specialties of one particular nation do n't go to the other .
Being away away from home I will miss my college and my school .
