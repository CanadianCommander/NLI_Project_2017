Um a nice book I have read is a biography from Marilyn Monroe .
Uh it 's a biography which portrays her life uh from uh her birth to her death .
It shows how she became a star , a well known star but how it was difficult for her uh to live as a child became she had many problems , a mother who did n't take care of her .
So it 's very nice to read it uh because some people always see the good face and the good part of Marilyn Monroe but there is a way to see how difficult it was for her .
