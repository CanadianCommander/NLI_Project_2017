Actually my favorites are two different kinds of reading materials .
First I like to read magazines especially scientific magazines to support my knowledge I went to the university and to find topics of interest and on the other hand I like to read novels especially if I have a lot of free time like a couple of days , of holidays um .
A couple of days of holidays to get with also free time to improve my English .
I read read a lot of English novels .
