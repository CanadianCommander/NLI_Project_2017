A interesting book that I read is called The Doctor .
It was written by Stephen King , the favorite American author .
It 's a signs fetching book where a small group is on a journey to find the tower uh which the whole universe belongs to .
Uh on the their journey they have to uh manage many uh difficulties and many enemies uh in the whole book .
Stephen Kings includes many of his other books he 's written in his , his own uh whole life and .
