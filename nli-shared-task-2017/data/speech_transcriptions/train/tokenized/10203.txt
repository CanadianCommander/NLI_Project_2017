If friends from another country would spend time in Germany , I would um suggest them to visit Dortmund my um the city where I study .
I think it 's a very nice city .
Uh they can um have much fun in clubs or in bars and uh do a lot of sports and uh there 's also uh uh big history .
There are are many old uh monuments and buildings that you can uh visit to to see the history of the rural area .
So I think uh Dortmund is a very nice city to visit and I would suggest friends uh to visit this city .
