I was given a very important opportunity uh I was offered an inter - internship in the most important newspaper in my country Uruguay .
And it was an wonderful opportunity to learn the practice of journalism and to work with uh full time journalists and learn about the craft .
And it was also an opportunity to put into practice everything I had learned in college .
So it was uh a real time job , uh I had the full responsibility and I got to publish my stories and to show them to my friends , to my family and to my professors .
And uh I learned a lot about responsibility and about the practice of journalism .
