During the summer I was able to uh develop government branch called Ethical .
It 's a town management place of the city that I live in .
It was important for me because I was able to work in an office in Marylin where everything was working as time management .
Also it was the part of the government that I 'm interested in working in the future .
Lastly , I did a project assistant job using computer and data bases and I was n't really familiar with the computer works .
And the job helped me be more skilled and comfortable with data base building and computers , the job I really .
