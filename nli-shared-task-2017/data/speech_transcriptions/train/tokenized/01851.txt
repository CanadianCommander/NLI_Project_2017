I will suggest my friend to visit Kanyakumari .
It 's located in the south southern India .
It 's a very beautiful place .
It 's very amazing to see and to observe that you 're standing either and point of your country .
It 's just near uh near to the the Indian Ocean and there are a lot things to see .
Uh Kanyakumari Temple is there which is very religious and the uh is of its own importance and you can can cool down themselves meditation hall .
In short , it 's very beautiful to see the beauty of sea as well earth and nature at the same spot .
