I read about the b - uh book called The Kicker and the Kicker uh it 's about football and a lot of teams are in the book and the , the uh the teams shows uh how many players they have and uh about the success of the team and you know everything about uh the team , for example what they won in the past or uh what their aims are in the future and uh you know a lot of things about the player , where they played before and what they , their reach in their career and how old they are .
And so I think it 's uh quite interesting book for me because I 'm always interesting in football and that 's the reason why I read that book .
