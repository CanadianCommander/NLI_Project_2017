Uh when I 'm away from my home I miss three primary things .
First of all is I miss my friends .
Secondly , my city and thirdly my family .
I miss my friends because my friends have a big influence on me and uh I share my with them .
Uh they 're one of the most important things in my life .
So when I go away , I feel their absence .
Secondly is that I miss my city , I live in Istanbul and Istanbul is a very beautiful city that I ca n't find anywhere in the world .
And thirdly , I miss my family uh um because they mean a lot to me like my friends .
