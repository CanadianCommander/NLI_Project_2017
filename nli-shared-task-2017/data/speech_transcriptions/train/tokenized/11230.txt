An accomplishment that I recently achieved was uh winning a tennis tournament .
It is important to me and very hard to accomplish because uh I live far away to my college and it takes a lot of time for me to travel back and forth .
And uh with the very little time that I had , I had to practice tennis and come back late in the night and sacrifice sleep and uh work much harder on my academic course and at the same time balance practicing my talent .
And as always I still manage to win a tennis tournament .
