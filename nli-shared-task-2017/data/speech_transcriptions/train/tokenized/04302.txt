If friends from other countries would come to Germany to visit me , I would take them to South Germany because uh it have it has a very beautiful landscape with lots of mountains and uh seas and um the agriculture of wine is very famous there .
 is a lot of beautiful big cities like uh Munich and Frankfurt and there , one can meet uh very nice people and um my whole family is living there and that 's why I think um that would be best to see the most of Germany and to explore the country .
