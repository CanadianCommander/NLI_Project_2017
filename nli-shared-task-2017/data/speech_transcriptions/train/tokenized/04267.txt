Actually , the most uh favora - , favorable uh qualities someone can has uh to be a team player is that he respects every team member .
To my mind , a group is only strong is everyone in the group , if every member is respected in the same way , because just take for instance uh here are some shy people can , if they 're fully respected and included in the team , uh , yeah by the team player , yeah can bring in their positive importance to the team work .
And that makes everyone uh equal in the group .
