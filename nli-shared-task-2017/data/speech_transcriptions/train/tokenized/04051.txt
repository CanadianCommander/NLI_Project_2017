When I 'm away from home I mostly miss my parents most .
Uh I love my parents a lot .
Uh my mom and dad they have always supported me .
I also miss my brother .
Uh we used to play a lot together , I miss the fun part .
I I also miss my mom 's food .
She she is a very cook .
In the hostel where I live , I do n't find that kind of food .
The environment of the home was very comfortable but in the hostel there is so much chit chat and so much activities going on .
It 's really I mean at times , I feel it 's not what I want .
And I definitely miss the group pairs that we used live in the evenings .
