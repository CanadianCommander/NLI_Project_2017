The special opportunity I was given to was that I got know my boyfriend and he 's American .
So he invited me to come over to America and that was really special for me because without him I would have never gone there and so I spent a few very nice month over there .
And um it was a really good experience for me because I could practice my English and I could get to know new people and it was really good for me .
And um finally I would say it was a really good time and I really like to get to know new people and to get to know new culture , new new things to see and to learn about and everything like that .
