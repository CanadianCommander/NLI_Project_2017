However , I think this most important is uh going to in another country .
Uh my family support me financially to go to another country to study , in order to study English .
I studied English there and also I met lots of people .
Uh I think this opportunity was the uh re - was really important because I uh had to choose study English and improve my English , on the other hand , um I had chance to meet with ne - new people and learn about their culture .
I also had chance to try lots of different foods .
