When I 'm away from my home town , what I miss uh most um is uh mainly my family like I 'm having lunch with them and sharing the things that uh happened during that day .
And also um the landscape because where I 'm from it has uh a lot of mountains and it 's also um in the coast .
So living in a big city as Madrid is uh is kind of different because um you can not escape from people and be alone for a while .
So um I miss the uh doing that going to see the um the sea and the tranquillity of of the environment in the .
