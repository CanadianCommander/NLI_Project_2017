Okay , an accomplishment in which I had to work really hard was when I was participating in the program in our college .
It is a natio - nationally coordinated event where people participate from various colleges from all over the country .
This was really important because I had to take care of my academics as well as attend to the event .
The main thing I learned was how to take how to manage time , how to take care that nothing is neglected and work efficiently .
Apart from this I was being observed by my bosses so I had to do really good and improve my skills .
It was indeed a very nice experience .
