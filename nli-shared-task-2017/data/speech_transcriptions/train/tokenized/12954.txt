When I when I first time to come to Shanghai I really missed my parent and because at the time I was fourteen so I really missed my parents and then now um it 's really busy to get in to study and then try to get in the university so there is n't time to think about the parents or other things .
So I really miss about the Korean food so because really Chinese food is really oil oily so that 's why I really miss the Korean food especially kimchi things and .
