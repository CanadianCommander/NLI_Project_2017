I think the most important qualities uh makes a person valuable in a team is not giving up well because of two reasons I think .
The important one of two uh is if a person is not giving up , uh they will , he or she will encourage others members uh to for example finish the project on time of uh make the responsibilities easily .
And uh , the second important uh reason of this is , it makes help to people make project that .
