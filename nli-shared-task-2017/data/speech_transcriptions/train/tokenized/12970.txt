An interesting book that I have read read uh is uh Rich Dad poor Dad .
This book uh presets two points of view about money .
It relates the view of uh rich dad who just finished the eighth eighth grade and was a wealthy man beca - because the money works for him and point of view of the poor dad who was um died without money because he always work for the money and the money did n't work for him .
Uh so it compares this different view about the how to work the money .
