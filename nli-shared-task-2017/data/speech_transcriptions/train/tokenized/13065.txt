The most thing I miss when I 'm away from home is of course my family and or my friends .
Uh I 'm very close to my family that is why I uh do a lot with them like activities and uh with my friends as well .
Another thing I really miss when I 'm away from home is the food , because uh I really like the German food here and you can not get it when you 're in in a foreign country .
For example , as well I 'm living in a small village and it 's surrounded by nature this another point I miss when I 'm when I 'm away from home and if I 'm living in a bigger city for example .
That is what I miss most when I 'm away from home .
