In my opinion one important quality which makes someone uh very valuable member of a team is the ability to communicate in a clear way .
Because in a team um members of a team have different opinions and maybe come from different backgrounds and when they speak to each other maybe they um might not be able to understand each other and then if such a team has a member who is able to understand uh people 's ideas and to communicate this ideas to other members so that other members can understand these ideas then uh the this group will be able to work together much more efficiently .
