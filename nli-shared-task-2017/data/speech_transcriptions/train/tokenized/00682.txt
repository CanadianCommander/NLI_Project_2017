The interesting book I read is a physics book uh which was there in my academic subject .
I like physics as my subject I fell physics is very interesting and physics deals about many things that happen around you .
What is the main basic functioning of all the things .
There are many things that and you know need to know how to how they function .
They are things like general levers and the that book help me a lot in understanding the practicality of everything .
