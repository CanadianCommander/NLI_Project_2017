The kind of material that uh I like the most to read in my free time is most of the times is magazines .
I like the magazines the most because it helps me to relive all my stress .
Uh since I 'm a uh lawyer student uh I need to find time to rest my mind .
When I 'm reading magazines I do n't need to use my mind , I do n't need to memorize anything and I do n't need to uh find some extra uh things to uh learn .
Because of these reasons , I like to read magazines the most uh when I compare them to the novels and poetry .
I like to read .
