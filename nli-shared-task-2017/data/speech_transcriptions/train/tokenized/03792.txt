Uh one interesting book I read uh few months ago was the Da Vinci Code .
Uh it was uh a really nice , the way uh the crime , the crime was happened and uh the way how they detec - uh detect uh like the people involved uh were like following uh uh the hints one by one uh traveling from one place to another trying to escape all the other people , uh chasing them , especially the French police .
Uh and of course like there was uh a nice , a nice couple or three twist in the , in the story which made it really exciting , like you will be so uh attached to the book up to the end and that 's what I liked about it most .
