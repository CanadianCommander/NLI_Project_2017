What I would suggest my friends to visit in India as a place or a city I will like them to visit around the sea I think .
Because that city in itself is incredible .
Uh the history associated with it the culture that it has the people and the place and the extra ordinary temples and the architecture .
Because that city has is a place to watch .
So I would suggest him to watch and there are a number of temples out there , which they wo n't see anywhere else in the country .
And that is the thing that they will remember , that they will go back and this is .
