If I could have any job I would be an actor in movies .
I love movies that 's the first and main reason , also as an actor in movies as far as your success you can choose between projects that you want to work on .
Then you work on them for a certain amount of time maybe a month , after which you have a holiday or vacation until you choose the next project .
As far as you can uh make a living that way , you can choose when to have a vacation , you 'll have a lot of freedom and you can work in a creative environment with exciting people .
I would love to do that .
