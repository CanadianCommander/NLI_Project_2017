Uh during my first semester at the university , I was given the opportunity of um doing a teacher assistantship .
This was important because it gave me the knowledge and also the experience of uh not only knowing different subjects that I was really interested in but also um being able to explain them to people and get people to get involved with those same subjects that I love .
Uh it was difficult experience since nobody really pays attention to someone their own age but it was very , very important for my education and uh to convince me that I want to become an economist .
