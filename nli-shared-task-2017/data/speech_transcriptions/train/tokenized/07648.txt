I obviously miss my family members a lot , my parents and my siblings .
Apart from that uh living in a hostel one misses the home cooked food which is obviously nutritional a well good and taste than what we get outside .
Also you know living in a home provides with many incomes for us which otherwise does not one realizes .
Uh like uh your clothes get ironed you do n't have to wash your clothes .
And most importantly the emotional support the support system that you get from living in home , that is what I miss most .
