In my opinion uh I once uh read a book about uh hand signs communication , it 's called gestures .
Uh it was about like uh what signs all over the world people do with their hands um deaf people or whatever .
And and here is an example of it like in it says in the book imagine like uh a deaf crowd in some program and they need to applause how would they do it .
And uh and the next page and his he shows you it was drawn that deaf people have their how they applause .
And so it was a special sign that they do and .
