An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was learning to dance .
I learned ballet and classical jazz .
Now uh for me this is a very important achievement because I learned a lot about grace , I learned about how I could um you know react to the react to music using my uh body and it gave me an understanding of basically myself .
Uh I was required to work pretty hard because uh if we cou - the sessions required to get in shape , to to work out quite a bit and do a lot of stretching .
So it was pretty painful and uh also it took a lot of manual preparation but in the end uh it was very rewarding to be able to learn to dance .
