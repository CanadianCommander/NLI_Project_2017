One of the most interesting books I 've read and also my favorite it 's called , it 's called The Beast 's Garden by Jeffrey Deaver .
This book is based on historical themes and I think this is important in a books because it helps me enhance my knowledge and also gives me the possibility to learn new .
He is an excellent writer and he was able to develop uh every character in the book making it more interesting .
And uh even though it is work of fiction , he also use many , um many .
