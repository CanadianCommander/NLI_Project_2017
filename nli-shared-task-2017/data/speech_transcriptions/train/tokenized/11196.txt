I 'm Italian so the first uh thing that I miss when I 'm away of course is the food .
But the Italian food of course is tasty , it 's it has different kind of , uh of dishes uh and I , I basically uh love it .
Even if of course you can adapt to other kind of foods .
Um the other thing that I miss very much uh are persons um that are close to me and in general people because Italian people are , are warm and familiar and uh open and always read to help you and .
