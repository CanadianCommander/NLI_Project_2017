Uh lately I read a book called The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver , Kingsolver and it 's uh about the missionary family going into the Congo and it 's about their journey and how they developed both personally and how they bond together as a family .
Uh the book is very intriguing itself because it illustrates a lot of uh aspects of humanity .
For example , there was a crisis where the youngest daughter died and the mother had to decide uh whether or not to leave the father which is her husband and uh there are also , the three sisters in the book also have di - very different characters so it 's a very interesting read .
