I think a valuable member of a team is the leader .
The leader because he controls and supervise all the people .
He um is the one who has uh to say that um you 're probably out of time and um what time you have to uh fix the date and all these stuff .
Um the leader is also the person who gives um the other members the feeling that he has the control over all the stuff they are choosing to do .
