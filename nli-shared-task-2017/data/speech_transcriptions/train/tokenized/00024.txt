Over there I attended an America school for um three years , and it was thanks to this uh this um travel this uh opportunity that I had , that I that I could uh that I learned English .
And I was able to uh know about new cultures , and uh learn about different behaviors .
Even if at the beginning I had a lot of difficulties because uh , uh my mother tongue uh was Italian .
Uh when it was time to leave I was very sad .
