So if a friend if uh friends of mine uh come to my country that is to see France , I think I would definitely uh take him in Paris for two main reasons .
The first one that uh the city has really rich past in history .
In this way we find a lot of monuments , uh pleasant places and museum .
For example it 's interesting to have a walk in uh the around the Eiffel Tower .
The second reason why I would bring it Paris is because of the atmosphere of such a city .
Uh in fact in Paris you can feel really uh different atmosphere according to the places you uh you go .
That 's why I think it 's interesting to go in such a place .
