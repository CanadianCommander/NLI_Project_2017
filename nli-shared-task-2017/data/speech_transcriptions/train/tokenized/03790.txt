What I miss the most about about my home when I 'm away is my family friends , people I used to hang out with , used to do like playing basketball < % > with a with a player , going outside with the < % > uh but the things I miss the most is my my parents because I love them so much and they mean a lot to me and a lot of things I just want want to thank them for that .
Also uh I miss my team mates that I play with and I just wish I can come back home as possible so I can play basketball with then again .
That 's uh that 's the most of it , I miss my home , my family , my mom .
