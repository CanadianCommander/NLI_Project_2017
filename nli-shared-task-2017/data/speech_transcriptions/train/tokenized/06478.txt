I like to read novels um because novels , for novels I can um learn the most sophisticated language .
I can um there 's a story presented and um I 'm also interested in style and writing .
So um now that 's of course can be treated in general .
There are good novels and there are bad novels .
I have my favorite authors which I , who I admire and um I 'd maybe like to be an author one day myself .
