When I 'm away from home first I miss my friends and my family .
Friends I can um have a lot of fun with we can join the evenings we can go to the cinema and with the family I can talk and go there to visit them .
Secondly , I miss my bed and my washing machine um I do n't like to sleep in beds which I do n't know and I will miss , or I miss my washing machine because um I can not wash my clothes whenever I like to .
