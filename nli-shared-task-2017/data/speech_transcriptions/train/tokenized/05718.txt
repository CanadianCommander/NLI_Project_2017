The special opportunity that was given to me is the opportunity that I can come to the American with my husband because he is studying in the University of the American so I came here with him .
I came here with him and I can get along together with him then I will have opportunity to practice my English and also I can apply the university in the American and to pursue , pursue my graduate study .
Also I can make many friends here and travel many areas in America .
