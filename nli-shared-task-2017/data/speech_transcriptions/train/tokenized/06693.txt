The accomplishment which I chose which required me to work very hard is the preparation for IATJ exam .
It is the exam which is one of the toughest exams of the world and it is one of the toughest exams in India as far as engineering studies are concerned .
And I chose this because it involves a lot of competition and about two lag or about point two million people beating this particular exam .
And there are a lot of challenging problems from brushing books like and sometimes a very new problem could run off you and it 's really tough rep - uh preparing for that .
And you have to pair three subjects in a span of two years , together with your studies of your uh plus one and plus two data , the , is the highest entry classes in India .
And that 's why it 's very tough .
