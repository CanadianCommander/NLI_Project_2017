I think it catch upon to , to be the going deep in the ana - , in the analysis of the society and how , how society could develop toward the regime or in uh , if it force the , to , is with , if it 's watched and controlled then and by an uh an authority that is not growing from the democracy .
And uh there are very interesting themes , and uh the themes where he is , he is staying , standing on a newsroom and there is uh , the television where the Big Brothers is talking and there is camera that is always watching him and he is trying to write down things on his diary .
