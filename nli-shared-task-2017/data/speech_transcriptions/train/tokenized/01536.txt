Okay I mostly like magazines about music especially hip hop music .
Um there is a magazine that called The Source , I like it because there is a lot of information about the music itself , about the person behind it , about new albums coming out and about nearly everything that surrounds but mainly not only in the music but uh the lifestyle and the way that people dresses the new clothes that is coming out and yeah the art uh just like graffiti and well that 's mainly it .
