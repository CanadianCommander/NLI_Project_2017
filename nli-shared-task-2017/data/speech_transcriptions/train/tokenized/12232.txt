I will , will to suggest my friend to visit Agra .
As Agra is the most famous city in country and which is uh one of the eighth wonder of the world .
But also it is very close to Delhi so it has very good communications via air and roads .
And also hotels and all things are very comfortable there .
So I can visit Agra to have a very memorable experience of India .
Also we can visit Delhi if visiting Agra and it is very central of the India .
Thank you .
