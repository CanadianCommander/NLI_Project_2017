The special opportunity was given to me is to work at a pharmacist in U.S.A. Working as a pharmacist in U.SA is very great , is a very great or very great importance uh but I have to do a lot before , before becoming a pharmacist in the U.S.A , I have to pass my equivalence exam so I have my TOEFL , IBT exam .
I already passed the first exam which is the equivalence test of my Pharmacy equivalence .
So it is time now to uh , uh to complete my IBT test so I , I want to this very much .
