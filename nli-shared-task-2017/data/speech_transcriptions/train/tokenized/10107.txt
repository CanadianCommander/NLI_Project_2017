I like to most read in my free time is novels because it it increase my knowledge so that I can spread my imagination also it , I can learn the how to read the novel and how to figure out things or motives like reading skills .
So it 's really helpful and it 's easy to understand stories when I go to the school .
That 's that 's why I I prefer to read novel .
