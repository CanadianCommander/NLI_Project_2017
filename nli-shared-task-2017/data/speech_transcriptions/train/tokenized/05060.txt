While I 'm away I miss my uh the most is my bedroom .
When I was tired I would like to lie on my king size bed and uh extend my arms and legs to get relax .
At that time I will do nothing but relax .
After that I will more energetically .
Uh besides that I always like to surf the internet in my bedroom .
And uh at night I can meet some friends of the , uh of mine by using online chatting instruments and also to talk to them .
And that will keep me away from pressures in my hard work .
Uh so if I h - if I keep , if I go away from um uh from home I will miss my bedroom most .
