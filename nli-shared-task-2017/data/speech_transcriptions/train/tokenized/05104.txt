I believe uh an important quality to work in an environment in a group is uh teamwork uh team spirited and also empathy .
Empathy is really the ability to understand other peoples point of view and to know where they 're coming from and uh therefore uh come up with something a position that will accommodate both their position and uh and the persons positions as well .
So it 's really an important quality in a group uh for for the group to cooperate uh function appropriately .
And I believe that will uh allow the group to um to be really effective .
