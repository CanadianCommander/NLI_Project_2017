When I was in Japan I was trying to be a dentist because my father was a dentist .
Then after I graduate in high school I tried to be a dentist but I could n't get in a college .
After that the Modern bank accept me as a painting student if I played uh team I can get a scholarship .
In that way I study in America .
It was very important because the suggestion for me American and can study in America right now .
That 's why it is special opportunity to me .
