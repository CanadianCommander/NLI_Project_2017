When I 'm away from home either a trip on camp , first thing that I miss about home is food , the food that mom gives me it 's what makes my life at home very comfortable .
It 's also the reason why I usually do n't dine out , just stay at home and eat the food that my mom gives me .
Next thing that I miss about my home when I go away is bedroom and everything that 's in it , just everything that 's part of my room .
Like for instance teddy bear in my bedroom .
It 's teddy bear was something that bought when I was on a trip when I was in the US to Idaho .
So it means a lot to me and being with it , it gives it makes me feel close to him and that 's the same for my brother .
