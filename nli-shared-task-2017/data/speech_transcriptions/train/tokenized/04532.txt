I would prefer magazines uh much more than the others novels and poetry uh because it allows me uh to it allows me to keep track of uh the occurrences in our uh lives and uh the such thing as politics , uh society , uh < % > all the others .
uh by the way I like to read novels uh to enhance uh and uh increase my uh ability to to think wide and uh see the different parts about the lives as they 're fictional and uh do not uh director uh directly show the realities .
