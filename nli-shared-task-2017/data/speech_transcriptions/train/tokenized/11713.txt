If I had friends visit Germany um I suggest to them they first visit um Berlin which is the capital .
They could see um a place where the government is , where the parliament , the construct .
Um then they should go to Cologne which is um a city with huge student live we can go to clubs and it has the dome which is um one of the biggest churches in Germany .
And then I would of course suggest which is a very nice city with old houses .
