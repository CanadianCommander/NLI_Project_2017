First of all I would uh advice them to fly into Milan because has the larger airports in the , in our country .
The , the hub 's uh well like my parents say it 's the most international hub we have .
Uh there is a huge number of flights coming in so it would be a very easy connection from wherever they 're coming from .
Uh and on top of that Milan is the fresh city , so you would have a lot of time um to spend in shopping .
Then I would suggest obviously the to , to go to Rome in order to get in touch to the , the , the area and uh the city from where our Latin cultures come .
And then to spend some time , I would send them to spend some time in Sicily .
