I really learn how the TOEFL tests because I need uh a good points for uh to start my study in because uh the study is in English .
I start to study textile and clothing management .
And uh it takes six semesters for the bachelor and u , without the TOEFL test and uh 61 points I can start to study .
And I have to wait more than one uh , I have to wait one year to start the new semester when I 'm do n't get the points .
