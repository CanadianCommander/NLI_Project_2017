When I was at the college , I used to have a microelectronic courses and for these courses , we had to to build a robot uh as a team .
So it was a team work and we need to work together to create a robot which was um suppose to be completely autonomous .
So it was really hard job .
We worked a lot altogether like we we 've made a lot over overtime working and it was very interesting because uh it helped us to work as a team to understand uh how we can we can really manage things together .
How we can share work and how we can make all these work to to get to good results .
