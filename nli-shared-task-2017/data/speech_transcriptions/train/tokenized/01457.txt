Read in recent times is a book by Dan Brown called The Da Vinci Code .
I love that book because it has some very fine detailed anagrams and the prequel of the book is like Angels and Demons and the Digital Fortress were interesting as well .
The details about the church and some aspects of the Catholics which we never knew reason and facts are very impressive .
The book has an amazing rate to relate the sequences and of course they just been in the books which reveal with the due course of the are amazingly interesting .
I appreciate the role by Dan Brown and I look forward to read more of his books .
