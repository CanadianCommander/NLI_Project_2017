I really have to say that I like to read car magazines in my free time because I really love cars .
First by reading car magazines regularly , I 'm always informed about the most actual cars on the market which enables me to talk with my friend about new models .
And second I think it makes enables me to dream about the cars I would like to drive in the future .
It shows me how much these cars are and therefore I can see what kind of job I need for in the future in order to be able to afford these cars .
Finally I love reading car magazines because um I really love design .
