If I have any job or career that I wanted I would take uh engineering .
I would take on engineering because they make a lot of money and you can support your family very well .
Also I pick engineering because I like technical , technical engineers and electricity , electrical lines and I like work and fix and make aeroplanes in airport .
It 's a fun job I like to go to .
