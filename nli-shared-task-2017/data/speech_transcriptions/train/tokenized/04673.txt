A quality that makes uh someone a valuable a valuable member of a team uh in my opinion is the capacity to listen to the other member of the team .
In fact the uh this is um a basic uh characteristic a member should have in order to um to lead all the the other group members and also to um make the other members speak and then state their opinions .
Uh in fact if uh there are n't um if the members does n't uh do n't um say their their opinions , it would be difficult to um convey and to and to uh reach .
