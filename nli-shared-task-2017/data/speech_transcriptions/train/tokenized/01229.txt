Well the opportunity I was given was to study European studies at university where I 'm studying now .
Because I wanted to go there in first place after my year in Madrid and Spain .
But I did n't have the right grade to come in there so went to another university which is , was more far in the north of Germany , and I did n't like it there very much , I did n't like the subject it was cultural studies and it was too theoretic .
So I tried it one year later and I did hope to come in and finally I got in .
So it was my chance and now I 'm very happy with this , because there are a lot of nice people and I like it very much to study there , I like the city and my subject .
