My home is where I grew up throughout my childhood I 've lived there and it is of great sentimental value to me .
I 've spend more than fifteen years there so I remember every detail of my hou - home .
The garden , the rooms , the bathrooms , the dining area et cetera .
I spend most of the time with my family in my home therefore that is attached a great value to it .
The things I miss most when I 'm away from my home is my pets and home food .
I 'm particularly fond of home food because it is what I have been used to eat while I grew up .
Uh my home bears a special place in my heart because it is the only place where I feel comfortable and truly at home .
