If given a job career of my choice I will have chosen , I will chose cooking as my career because my childhood has been grown up had pass in kitchen watching my mom cooking .
I know so much about food and Aroma so I would always want to be a chef when I want a career and work with the best restaurants I can .
It has always been a dream for me that I can fulfill what my mother had taught me .
So I would want to take a career in food technology and use all my knowledge .
