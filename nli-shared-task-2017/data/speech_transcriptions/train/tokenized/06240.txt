If friends from another country came to Canada to visit me I would first show them around the since that the city I live in .
After that I would take them to Quebec because it 's the closest , it 's about an hour half drive from .
And uh there is a lot of fun things to do in there like go skiing , snowboarding in winter .
There is also the hot springs there where you sit in a place like a hot tap that 's very warm and nice .
After that I 'd probably take them to Edmonton because of the galaxy land .
Since the rides there are very fun and they have very nice swimming pool there and we 'd enjoy ourselves , have a good time .
