The most difficult accomplishment that I uh that I fou - that I found myself in uh was to train some children for a competition , for a sport competition .
So and I 'm not a um professional um trainer .
So I have to find um the um some sources new for me inside of me and so every time you have to do something new , you have to find um your own ability that maybe you even do n't to have .
And also working with children is not easy .
