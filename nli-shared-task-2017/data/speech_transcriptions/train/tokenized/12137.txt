Well the book I have read and to which I consider to be worth mentioned here is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley .
Um it is a very interesting book uh that draws an image of an utopia which is um some years and future ahead of us .
And um the interesting fact about the book is that it was written uh many years ago I think in the nineteen thirties and uh that it 's even long before the A bomb was developed .
And um nevertheless there many things Aldous Huxley has uh seen in the past which really happened in the future and which are really , which is really interesting .
