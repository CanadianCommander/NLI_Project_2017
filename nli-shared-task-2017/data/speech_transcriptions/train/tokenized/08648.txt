I had a great opportunity uh to be able to go on um a flight with the Swiss Military Army um in Geneva .
Um it was very important to me because um my parents uh saw me in a different way .
They realized that I was a courageous girl and that um I , I was interested in things that uh girls and people my age do n't really do .
And um I guess it showed me uh , uh possible way of um of uh possible future really .
And um that 's it .
