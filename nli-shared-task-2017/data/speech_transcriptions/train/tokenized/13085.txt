I mainly read novels uh from different writers um in my spare time because uh I love real - really reading books um because they enter - entertain you for many weeks or even months um in contrast to magazines or just poetry .
They are just kind of a kind of the company .
Um and further more it enhances and stimulates your imagination while reading .
You get new ideas on the one hand and on the other hand you can really relax by reading a novel because it 's the you can uses the time you want .
