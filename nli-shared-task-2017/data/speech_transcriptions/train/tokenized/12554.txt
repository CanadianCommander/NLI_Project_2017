When I 'm away what I miss the most about my home country is the food .
I come from France and there the food is really important .
My favorite food is cheese and often abroad cheese does n't taste as good as in France .
Uh for example in Germany um the cheese does n't have a strong taste , German people like rather um um other they they like Gouda for example which is a kind of cheese that I do n't like because I do n't feel that it has a taste .
So when I guess when I 'm abroad I 'm dreaming about cheese because it 's the thing I miss the most .
