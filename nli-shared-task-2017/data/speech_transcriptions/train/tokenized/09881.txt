Uh most favorable and interesting book I have read and the most memorable book was Mice and Men .
Uh this book is about two characters , George and Lennie and both two have a different like contr - contradicting personality and it 's about the experience they go through together and well , the whole structure of the story was very interesting to me and uh how they contradict the character , characters character was also fascinating as well .
However , I really liked the end and the story , the circumstance they are put in into the story , put it in the story because like I thought it was very realistic and it was pretty like , and the actual story was pretty emotional and touching , emotionally touching as well .
So I thought this book very fascinating and it was most interesting book I ever read .
