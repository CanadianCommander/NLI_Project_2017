If a friend from another country was going to spend time in my country .
The city that I would suggest they visit would be Jerusalem .
This is because Jerusalem is as uh one of the oldest cities and it is um uh it is a place all the uh holy religions are .
Um Islam , Christianity and Judaism .
So it would be a very interesting place to visit .
It also has uh very interesting little shops that people can be souvenirs and little things and um also people living in the city are very friendly and uh would treat those visitors well .
