Oh it 's really interesting question .
Um since I 'm staying uh out of my home since the past ten years , I really miss my parents .
Um mainly I miss my mother .
Whenever I 'm eating outside and whenever I 'm um making food or cooking , I just remember my mother how nicely she used to cook and give me .
I never used to have any kind of tension for my uh food or uh for in the timings .
What , what time I have to eat or what time I , I have to sleep .
Uh because she was there all the time .
She used to look after me and she used to , morning she used to make me wake up , but here or when since I 'm staying out , I have to use alarm .
Here really I miss my mother very much .
