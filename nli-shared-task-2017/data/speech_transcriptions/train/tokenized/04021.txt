When although I live in Brazil for now I consider Japan as my country .
Therefore , I will going to speak about uh the case if my friends her , if , if my friend were to go visit Japan .
I suggest her to visit several cities in Japan considering that I believe my country has several different faces depending on the city that she might want to visit .
For instance in Tokyo she will be able to face modern life that Japan has developed over several decades after the World War Two uh such as uh Akihabara which has a lot of technology and also .
