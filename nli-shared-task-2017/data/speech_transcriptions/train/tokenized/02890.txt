When I 'm away from home , the most and uh like I miss my parents , I miss my room , I miss my bed , I especially miss my dog .
Uh the thing is , like when you 're at home , everything is like very familiar and really comforting , everything is in the way you want them to be , but when you 're away , you have to get used to uh some other people 's like conditions or the way they live .
So when I get back home from a vacation or something , it feels like we 're able to see everything and the way I want them to be .
