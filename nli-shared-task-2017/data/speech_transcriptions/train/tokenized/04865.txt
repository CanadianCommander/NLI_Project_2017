I think that to be a valuable member of a team you 'll have to be on , always on time .
To be an example for of them , to support the team giving out money .
Or just working on the project and spending time on it .
Um to listen to other members and take them in consideration , be on the meetings .
Um help them always trying always to um promote it .
