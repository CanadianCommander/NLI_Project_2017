One of the most interesting books I 've read is called The Consolations of Philosophy by Alain de Botton and it 's , it 's very interesting because it applies uh the philosophies , pretty big names of philosophy into , onto everyday life uh from since the philosophy of Nietzshe or Schopenhauer or Seneca , the people that we have heard about at university but not necessarily studied uh in depth .
So here Alain de Botton provides uh good examples of how we can actually use these people 's philosophies to help us live our lives uh more , more serenely maybe or more happily .
So the book is very well documented .
It 's got their pictures and it 's still a lot of fun to read and is also uh something that really help me in many situations dealing with things .
