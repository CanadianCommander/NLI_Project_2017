Last year I read a book called the um Crazy Turks and it was one of the best sellers and I chose to read it because uh first of all the reputation was really good and uh and my friends advice recommended to me and it was sort of a thick book it was n't so short but when I started reading it um though it talked about it mainly explained the war of Independence of Turkish society Turkish Turks Turkey but in a way that um sort of funny and also um lecturing parts .
It included also some uh sort of uh sad memoirs of the soldiers and .
