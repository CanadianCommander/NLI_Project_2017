Amongst the things I did last year , uh I went to America and it was a challenge for me so it means that uh I had to work hard for it because I did n't know anything about the country , anything about the language , and uh I 'm a kind of person who is shy so I had to work hard to to go into a team to improve my English and uh to experiment the uh the culture and uh a way to live .
So that 's what I mean by working hard .
Um what I had to do is um make some more relationships with other people .
The fact that I was shy was n't good for me .
