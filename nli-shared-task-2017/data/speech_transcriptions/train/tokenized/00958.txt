It is important to me all the opportunities that I 've had in my life .
One of the best oppo - opportunity that I had and was that I went to Argentina but not just to study .
I went to give a year to Catholic Church to help others .
To give all of what I have to , to help other people to be near God .
But this experience helped me a lot because I think the more you have the more you have to give .
And that 's why I think I 'm happy now because I 'm giving and I 'm still giving .
