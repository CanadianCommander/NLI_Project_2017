I worked very hard to be and appear in America and studying at the local university in Connecticut in America at the sa - same time .
It required a lot of time management um to study and to take care of three kids .
In the morning , I had to prepare my kids for school .
And then go to university and focus on my studying there .
After I finished my classes at the university , I had to pick up my kids , prepare the dinner , to help them with their homework .
At night , I had to study .
I am very proud that I managed studying and taking care of three kids at the same time .
