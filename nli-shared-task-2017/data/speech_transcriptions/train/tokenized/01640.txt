At the end of last year I had to take the first part of the German State Examination in law .
I chose International European Law for this and um I had to study very hard to pass .
The examination um consisted of short thesis I had to write of about forty pages of an oral examination and written examination .
Um we took about three or four month to prepare this examination and um I had to study very hard with uh some of my fellow students .
Um the topics we had to uh we had to deal with was um covered a wide range of um of different topics in law and that is why it was very very difficult for us .
