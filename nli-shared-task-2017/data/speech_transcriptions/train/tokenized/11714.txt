A really special opportunity that was given to me in my life was um the opportunity to go to the United States to be an au pair .
I think um it was really important um opportunity to me , for me because um it really made me very independent person , I learnt to take care of other people , to take um care of kids , watch them twenty four seven and um also I value my home country much more because of that .
Because I think once you 're gone you just learn to um appreciate where you come from a lot more .
It was also a nice opportunity to get to know new people from all different countries because we al - always had meetings with other um au pairs and they were from all over the country so it was nice to meet new people and get to know new cultures .
