Well I obviously miss a lot of things when I 'm away from home first of which is my family because I do many specific things with them .
Like for example I went to the cinema with mom and I really miss that .
I also miss the physical contact that I have with my relatives such as my family as just as I 've just said with my friends and also miss of course about the comfort that I experience when I 'm home and especially more more or less speaking about the city uh about the beautiful the beauty of Paris because uh when I live Paris , I realized that I really miss the city and the architecture compared to the different and well the other major cities ever since such as New York or Rome .
