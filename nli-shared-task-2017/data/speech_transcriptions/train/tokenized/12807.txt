What I really like the book was about The Artisan and it told me lots of things with it at first .
Uh there it mentions about interesting stories which I did n't experience before and secondly I can learn lots of things in it .
Uh when I read that book uh it encourage me a lot by teaching many things so I can learn lots of things .
Uh and finally it also told me to live , the way how to live .
Uh the I like this book .
