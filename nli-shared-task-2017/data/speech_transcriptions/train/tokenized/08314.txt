One of the accomplishments I had is accountancy examination .
That 's very useful for me and it 's really important as well because I wanted a career in which I can excel and grow .
I do n't want to just start like any vacancy in life .
I want to start with something to be complete .
Like oh , he 's a general accountant , that 's great .
I want that sort of to be done .
And that gives a hard gear confidence and a sense of pride to take on matters or to solve problems take confidence .
