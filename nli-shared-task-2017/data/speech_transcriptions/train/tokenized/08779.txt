I think a quality that makes someone a valuable member of the team is his cooperative nature .
A person who is cooperative is always valued as a member because other person because he is always helping .
Uh moreover if a person is cooperative you can share the knowledge , whatever he or she has gained through his experiences .
If a person is not cooperative then he will not possibly get the help from that result .
So whenever a person can learn a lot from his experiences is just like uh telling his knowledge .
He will not be able to uh expand his horizon or knowledge also .
So if he is cooperative , he will he is due to help others he will possibility get the help from others .
Moreover in the group it 's very important to work as a team and working as a team is only when there is cooperative nature among the members .
