The first thing I really miss when uh I 'm away from home is uh my mug uh which I use uh in the morning just to have my first coffee uh and to wake up uh in a good way .
Then I also miss my CDs and my hi-fi because I love music very much and I collect uh uh lots of uh music or CDs and uh uh when I 'm uh down or depressed , I try to uh listen to the music to to feel better and uh it 's very helpful to me .
