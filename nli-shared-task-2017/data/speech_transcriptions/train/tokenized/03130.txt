According to me , a quality of a member , uh quality for a team or group member to have is important , because without quality , you can not take anyone in the group .
If you take anyone with , uh without any quality , good qualities which are required for the group , he might do nothing in the group .
He might just uh , and he might let other guys do his work and he might just this which is not good .
There must be equal contribution by the members of the group so that all of them contribute properly to the group .
And the group uh achieves good , good work or get good grades or something .
So it is good to have a quality member in the team .
