Uh the accomplishment that required me to work my hardest was uh my getting into an Indian Institute of Technology .
It was a really difficult task because uh there were two , two hundred thousand com - uh competitors along with whom I had to take an exam , and then out of them only three thousand people were selected to be uh entered into that institute .
So that 's really a high dropout rate uh high rate for people .
It is very important to me because uh it provides me the education that I dreamed of ever since I was a child and also uh it would give me a good economic basis for my future .
