I would suggest um for the person who 's coming to my country to go uh visit Jeddah because it 's less conservative .
As you know Saudi Arabia is a is a religious country and conservative .
It 's in Jeddah uh is not as conservative conservative as the other cities .
It 's beautiful , the beach there is wonderful .
Therefore you can spend a lot of time and the and the beach , the weather is kind of hot , but more likely it 's it would be okay .
Um uh in addition to this one of the beautiful countries because of the weather .
