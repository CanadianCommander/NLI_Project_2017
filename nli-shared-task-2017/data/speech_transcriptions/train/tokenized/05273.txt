The most interesting book uh , I 've read is The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers .
I think it 's a wonderful book because it uh because of that book I got the chance to improve my English and also got the chance to to get to know uh Tolkein who is the author and maybe to get uh a rather good insight in the linguistic origin of , of English and other , other type of languages , mostly fro - from the area of Britain and , and Germany .
Finally I would say that it 's , the best thing about that book is uh the fantastic uh characters that take place in it .
It 's wonderful .
