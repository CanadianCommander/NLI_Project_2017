I miss my mother 's love , I 'm away from home .
The food she cooks for me and the care she takes of me when I 'm at home uh I 'm at my place .
Definitely is someone is away from home what one misses the most is the family and the family what it does it provide , it provides you with care , it provides with food , it provides you with with all the rest of the things which are needed to live in a society .
And what do you miss while you are away from a family , is your friends , is your your mother took care , they shower you and the love which they give you .
