What I miss the most about uh my home when I 'm away is uh mostly the food , uh the way I eat everyday and uh which is not far away from home .
Uh the architecture which is kind of different , um there is a very different kind of architecture , culture , art .
I miss my friends too these are not the same people there , these are different mentalities .
And uh the other things I miss is um the different sense of humor people have because it depends on the culture .
