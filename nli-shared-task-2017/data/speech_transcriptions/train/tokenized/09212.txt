I like to read most of my free time .
I read novels , reading materials such as novels and to read on free time .
They affect it , they are close to one 's life as the novel describes them and is very good experience one gets reading novels .
It will really affect you if one follows novel 's reading and as it is close also a very good example of novels are uh a novel that I read is body language from Joe something it is a very good novel .
Which can and something like that .
