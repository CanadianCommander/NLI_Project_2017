Uh if friends from another country were gong to spend time in my country uh I would suggest uh they visit the city in live in , which is Istanbul .
Because uh Istanbul in my opinion is the uh most lively city in Turkey and it is deemed to be commercial and entertainment capital .
And it is very historical city as well .
Because it was the capital of the Ottoman empire .
And uh it was the host to many many civilizations such as uh civilization and Ottoman civilization .
And uh there is also a very lively nightlife .
