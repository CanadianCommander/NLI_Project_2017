A book I really find interesting that I have read in the near past is Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Marcia Marquez .
This book uh relates the story about a man and a woman who met when they were really young and they fell in love .
Uh because of problems with parents that they did not accept this love he goes on and she is to , she marries someone else and he loves her until the day that her husband dies .
He returned to look for her and he proposes marriage .
