I live with my family and mom so when I 'm I 'm away from home the thing that I miss the most is my family and their support .
It 's really hard to live without them .
The second thing that I miss the most , this may sound a little funny but it 's my mother 's food .
She 's the best cook I have ever seen so when I 'm not at home I miss mother 's food .
And last but not least , I miss my clothes since I 'm on since I 'm on a vacation or on a trip I can not bring all my clothings with me .
So when I 'm out of my house I miss the dresses I left at home .
