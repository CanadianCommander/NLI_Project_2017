Well when I 'm away from home I feel sometimes quite lonely and sometimes I feel at and I miss really much my family and my friends .
And also another thing really important for me is the cooking of my mom she makes well .
So I think all this things explain why I is really difficult and really tough for me to be away from home and I need really much to feel loved and care of my parents and of my sister and of my friends .
They advice me really well and another .
