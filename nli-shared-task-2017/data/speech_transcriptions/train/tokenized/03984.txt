When I am away from home , what I miss most is my family .
I really love my family and I like to be with my sister and father and mother .
Also our what I also miss is my friends , it 's nice to have your friends living next door so you can meet them all the time and just do the everyday things you like to do with your friends .
Another point which I like to stress that I that I miss when I 'm not at home is that it 's just a lot more comfortable to be at home , you have everything you need .
Your own room , your privacy and you know you can just , it 's easier to do the stuff you want to do and another thing I miss .
