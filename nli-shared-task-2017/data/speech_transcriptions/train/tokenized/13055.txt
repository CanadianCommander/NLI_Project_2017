I think that what I miss most uh when when I 'm away is uh for example my friends .
Um cause um when you 're away you miss the usual habits that you have with them to go out together to go to the cinema together .
Uh also I miss food for example .
It 's uh very big contrast , the Mediterranean the Mediterranean diet um uh and the other diet in world for example more at the north in your bored through the other side in America .
Also what I miss is the music .
Uh the music is very different um here .
We 've got lots uh different styles of music whereas , abroad depending on which country you go , there is a certain type that is more common .
