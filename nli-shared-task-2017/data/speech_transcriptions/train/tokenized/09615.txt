In my free time I like to read sports articles from worldwide leagues on sports .
Um I myself played football , hockey back in my exchange year to Texas in two thousand and four , two thousand and five .
It always gives me update on the scores and standings .
It also shows different trends action from players going to different clubs .
This is very interesting I also I am very sport-ish um it just keeps me updated and uh I also think it 's a good hobby to keep in shape you be you stay healthy and uh this way you have a lot of fun and you can share it with other persons that share the same passion .
