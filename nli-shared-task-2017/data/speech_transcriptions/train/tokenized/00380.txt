I have been studying in abroad and uh I uh finance my studies with a scholarship so this scholarship is the uh biggest opportunity that I uh got , because uh uh first of all , uh it was always my dream to go abroad for uh my further studies uh without uh any uh uh scholarship I think I would n't have been able to uh make my uh dream uh true .
Uh with the help of this scholarship I could come to uh Germany and here I met different cultures uh different people I uh learnt uh from them and this really broaden my uh vision .
