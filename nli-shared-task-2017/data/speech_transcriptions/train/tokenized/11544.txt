I would take um my friends from another country to Berlin , because it is one of my favorite cities as well and it is the capital of Germany .
And you can do a lot of sight seeing and there are lot of historic buildings and also um I would take them to , to the Ol - Olympia stadium where all the soccer , soccer games are .
And also I would um show them around into the city center and would go shopping because I really enjoy shopping there because they have a lot of shops and nice things to see in the city center .
