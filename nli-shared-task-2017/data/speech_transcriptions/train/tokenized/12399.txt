Uh the book I read uh is called the Wide City and I forgot the name of that author .
Uh it , its story is about uh the history of architecture especially of the uh Colombian World Exhibition in Chicago in eighteen hundred eighty three and it combines uh the setting of the archi - of the world fair uh with the story of the mass murder uh uh in America .
Uh and it 's uh based on facts and that makes it even more exciting as uh both stories are uh almost forgotten , or were almost forgotten and yeah .
