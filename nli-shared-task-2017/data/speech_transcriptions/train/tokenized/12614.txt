All my life I have been living with , as a child I , I usually went to my dad work he , he is a CEO of a small en - enterprise here in .
As I sat there in the side walk I would see how he would lead his business into a successful ad - administration .
I would like to start a business administration because it will accentuate my abilities to be of my abili - my leadership abilities .
It will demonstrate that I li - I like to work with persons and at the same time it will demonstrate the facility I have to in my community .
At the end I will like to help my family and as well as anyone involved in the profits I gain from business administration .
