I think cooperation is one of the most important facts that make someone valuable member of a group or a team , because if we are working in a group , we need to cooperate with each other otherwise there will lots of clashes and not be able to produce the result as uh , as the one desired .
And another factor is if we are willing to listen to each other and cooperate with each other , it would be beneficial for us , because uh then more ideas will come and we 'll have a broader view about the topic and we 'll be able to work in a better circumstance , in a better situation .
And cooperation helps us to uh listen to others and that is very important in a group .
