A special opportunity that was given to me in two thousand and one uh was when I went to the United States on an exchange program with an exchange organization .
They offered me a place for a year in uh Pennsylvania which I took uh after a short contemplation .
We , we , were three students at the university and even though we did a lot of stuff together we , um we got to know the United States and the culture surrounding us very well .
It it made me adopt another culture .
