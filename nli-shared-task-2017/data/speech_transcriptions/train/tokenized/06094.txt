When I 'm abroad naturally uh the things that I miss most probably um are those people that are closest to me um at home .
Uh which includes first of all my parents and then my friends that are you know the closest to me .
Um so this would uh be the people um that are closest to my environment at home that I miss the most .
Um apart from that I 'd say that um there are a lot of environmental things that I probably miss .
First of all places uh in my home city that mean a lot to me that uh you know give me an opportunity to relax .
