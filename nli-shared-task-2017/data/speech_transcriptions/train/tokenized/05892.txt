In my free time I usually prefer to read both novels and magazines .
Um novels are usually more recent ones um not only recent ones but also some old novels and some classics like Uncle Tom 's cabin which I 'm reading right now .
Um but as I said more recent novels like the ones for Dan Brown and further more I really like magazines that are able to inform me on current topics and events that happened not only in Germany but all over the world .
Because if we 're interested usually we 're interested in recent events and things that interact with each other in terms of events .
