The most interesting book I have ever read was the Moon Stone .
It shows the journey of an Indian diamond which carries a curse on it .
It , this curse is being carried on by each and every individual who tries to handle it or who tries to snatch it away .
It , this book has got suspense and has got each and every clear part of how it has the stone has to destiny to each and every individual .
It shows how it was primarily starts from India and then taken to En - uh England where it curse uh carries the curse and few people and then back to it 's original position that is India .
It 's got prime value .
