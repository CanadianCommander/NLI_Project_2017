The thing that I miss the most when I 'm away at home are my parents both my mom and dad .
But I love them very much right from my childhood they are the only person I was been with and uh I really miss their support their guidance uh uh because they were the persons right from my beginning , right from my school who guided me in my studies gave me the right decisions at the right time .
Uh without them I really do nothing nothing at all so I , I really miss their guidance and love and and love and comfort they show me when I 'm in , when I 'm downhearted , troubled or messed up with things .
So that 's the most thing I miss when I 'm out of home
