Yes the most hard accomplishment which I have faced until now , was preparing myself to do um an exam to be um a tours guide to work in Egypt .
It was for me very important because I could speak language and I wa - I had uh uh the chance to contact tours < % > in Egypt and to show all the people uh my culture and to explain the ancient history of my land and also as a sign to uh to spend some days with the tours also to enjoy these days and I pay for it nothing I give money for it .
