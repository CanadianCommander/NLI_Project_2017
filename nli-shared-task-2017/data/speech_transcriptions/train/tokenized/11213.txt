Okay I 've been living from home for the past three years because I have been studying in a college away from home .
When I 'm away uh the most of mi - the thing I miss the most is my family .
Uh we are a very small family that is why I 'm very close to my mother and my brother and my father .
I really miss them when I 'm away from home .
Secondly I miss the food at home .
Normally it 's the complain of all hostel life that they do not get good food when they stay away from home .
So that is one thing I would really miss .
And thirdly I would miss my friends and my extended family .
Like my cousins and my school friends who are not there with me and miss , miss spending some time with them .
And all the familiarity that I have when I stay at home .
