As the saying goes ` home sweet home ' .
Home is a place where we can achieve whatever we want and relax .
We have , we get the parents ' care and the love they give for us .
We miss that the most when we are not in the home and that we are away from the home .
We miss the home food ; the delicious items prepared but you ca n't find food like that uh outside your home .
It 's just uh um handmade food , but it 's not the food made by your mother which it so delicious .
There is no other place in the world which replaces your home .
