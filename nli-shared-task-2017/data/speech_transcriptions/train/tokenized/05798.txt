The first thing which we will which I 'll miss when I 'm away from home is the food .
There is a lot of problem with the food respect to the food and what you eat when you 're out of home .
If you 're at your home you 'll always get the right food at the right time .
The next thing I would miss is regarding to chores which I do , the house hold chores .
The thing is I would have to work and finish all my work all by myself rather than giving it some servant maid .
Best part which I would be missing is the support which I get from my family and the homeliness .
