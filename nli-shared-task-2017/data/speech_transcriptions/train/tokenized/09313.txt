I miss most my parents and my three brothers and sisters , because during my childhood I spent a lot of time with them .
Also I will miss the German food um because is very delicious .
And um I will miss uh , uh my city Hamburg because it 's very beautiful and I like to go for a walk near the harbor and go shopping in the city .
