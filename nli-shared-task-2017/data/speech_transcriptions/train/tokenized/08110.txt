The book that I found interesting is called The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri .
It 's been I find it interesting because it depicts the the perspective of a person of an Indian going abroad in America .
It depicts the culture shock that they go through , it depicts how they come to terms with the different culture while maintaining their roots , their native culture .
How they how they try to inculcate the values in their children , how they respond when the children do n't have do n't learn what they want them to as they want them to be .
It basically talks about how they comes to reality of the world .
