What I miss most when I 'm away from home is the familiarity of my surroundings .
Uh living alone is like in a strange place , uh you do n't have anyone familiar with you , your parents are not there your siblings are not there and there is no one to help you out when you are down .
No one to share your happiness with , the support system is not there .
Uh another thing that I really miss is uh the way mum cooks I really love my mum 's cooking so I really miss that when uh when I 'm living alone or when I 'm uh when I 'm over at my house .
Uh the other thing is that the parents and the siblings usually help you out at home so that is one more thing with you which I miss a lot about my home when I 'm away so these are basically the things that I miss when I 'm away .
