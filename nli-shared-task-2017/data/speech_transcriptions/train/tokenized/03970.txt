A great opportunity for me was coming here to United States from my country Colombia .
It was a great opportunity for me because me and mom were able to come to a better country and get a better education .
We are very happy here and we like it more than we liked it in our own country .
Um my sister had been living here for thirteen years and she finally made it uh this come true which the greatest opportunity we 've ever had me and my mom , not only because education is better here but because the economic situation is also better , so we were able to find better jobs , make more money than we - than if we were when we were in Colombia and we also have the opportunity to go back and forth to visit our family .
