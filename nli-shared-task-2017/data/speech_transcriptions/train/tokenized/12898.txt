I would surely take them to Rome which I think is the most beautiful city in the world because it has a lot of history and most of all uh there is a very good vibration and uh surely , I should take them Venice too cause uh I think it 's kind of unique , is something you can see only in Italy .
But uh their visit would be incomplete if uh they do n't go to the sea side of Italy especially I think in the south like in Sardinia or in Sicily where the beaches are really really beautiful .
And I think uh visit uh somewhere in the Alps would ma - would help them uh uh the big picture about what is in Italy .
