When I 'm when I am away from I really miss my room because I spend much time of the into my room .
I miss my stereo and my PC because I love me sitting down in front of the PC and I miss my bed and my bed and my sofa because I love to read book , being sitting down on the bed , being sitting down on the sofa and enjoying my enjoying the time uh while relaxing myself .
I really miss the the bed sit the the the thing that I miss most is my PC because I love surfing the net and sometimes I mean when I am away from home I do n't have any PC and so I ca n't surf the net and I can not enjoy my time .
