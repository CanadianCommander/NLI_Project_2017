I prefer novel the best because first of all I think when you start a novel you always want to know what happens next .
It attracts me to read the whole book and secondly I think uh the characters uh in the novel would present a very ideal person for you .
It could be a model for me like I want to be her or I want to learn something for I can learn something from her , her personality or her , her how she or her treats do things .
And thirdly I think uh uh the thoughts and the flashing parts of the writer could uh you could see the flashing the thoughts of the writer in the novel and uh .
