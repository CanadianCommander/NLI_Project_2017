The I think that the important quality and the first quality that is very important it is honesty .
The I think that everybody can rely on that person and everybody will think that well uh someone is honest and very clear .
We trust him so the conversation can be a good one so the team work is much more efficient .
If somebody starts to lie or uh uh finding different ways to uh fool around all the people so it will not be efficient .
So I think that we can build a very strong group a very close strong team as soon as everybody is working in the same direction who is very clear and friend and honest .
