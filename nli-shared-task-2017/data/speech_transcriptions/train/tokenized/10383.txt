Uh in my opinion , being open-minded is a very uh important quality when working in a team .
Someone who is open-minded is able to integrate all persons working in this team and to help them participate if there 's for example somebody who is , who is weaker or who is uh more quiet person , the open-minded person can try and help him and coach him to integrate then into the team work .
He need such a member in a team in order to guarantee that uh the team can work together efficiently .
It 's very important to be open-minded .
And therefore I think open-mindedness is the most important quality within a team .
