When I 'm away I mostly miss the food , the home country food um food was what I ate from when I was young therefore uh I was not used to the new new types of food in in the other country .
The other thing was about the language uh I miss language when I was away from the home because I could n't actually communicate with others and I could n't uh convey my thoughts to the others .
These are the two things that I most miss .
