If I could have any job or career I wanted I would choose to be a teacher .
Uh I think a teacher is the opportunity to approach the job and especially to help people around me .
I think the teacher experience would be great for me because as well as they impact in education I think I could be , I would be able to help others .
And also to develop skills in my life .
I think the teacher experience you can find a new way of living and also a way to approach new people and different types of minds which are in the schools .
If as well I would be a teacher I think that I would be .
