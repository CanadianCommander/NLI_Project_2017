I miss most about being , about my home is the care love that my parents have for me .
Also I miss is the fights and the arguments that I have with my brother .
Uh there i - , there are many things that are about home and one of them is my mother 's deliciously home-cooked food which was really important in my life .
Other things that I really miss about my home are uh the continuous attention , the right and the wrong things that my parents used to tell me which are very important in my life right now .
