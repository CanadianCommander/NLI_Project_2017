Well , uh recently I read a book uh which is called uh , The Nine Eleven uh Commission Report .
It is a report about uh the terrorist attacks on the American soil , the eleventh of September two thousand and one .
I think the book was very interesting because I could read a lot of uh information about this uh terrible day .
A lot of details , a lot of uh point of view and also some , some things you , I , I could n't uh be informed with uh just simple uh documentaries uh I see and that for example on uh television .
That is why uh I really , really like uh this book .
And uh I will , I will give it to some friend of mine .
