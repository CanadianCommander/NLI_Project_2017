This year I contacted a professor I the university of the United States who offered me to work in his laboratory for my doctorate studies .
This is an extremely important opportunity for me because this professor is highly confident in the field which interests me , which is special cognition .
He has expensive experiences he could guide me better than previous advisors had .
And also in this laboratory we have advance techniques of virtual reality which I would not be able to use in other universities and it 's a very large scale environment .
So this would allow me to do exceptional studies uh assessing the spaces special cognition which will be very great for my CV and also for future advance medical knowledge .
