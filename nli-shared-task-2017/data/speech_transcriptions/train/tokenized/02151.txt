That is a nice question though .
Actually I came to the United States to study and get my undergraduate degree in the that in petroleum engineering .
I do n't want to go back to Saudi Arabia and work at Aramco companies , like a vary huge company in the oil , a very huge oil company .
I do n't want , I going to work over there at as an engineer because it is really an opportunity for me to like to have rally a good salary and to have really a great career and job and uh to start having a family and everything .
And by the way I 'm from Saudi Arabia and it is a very huge country that 's have a rich and a lot of oil .
And they need petroleum engineering that is why I want to go back and work at Aramco as the biggest oil company in Saudi Arabia and have a good career .
