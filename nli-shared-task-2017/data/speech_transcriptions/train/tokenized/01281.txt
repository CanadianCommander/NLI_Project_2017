I believe so that it is very important quality for a person in a team .
They have to care about people in their team , what they do and how they feel .
If a person does n't know how the others are feeling , he will not be able to work with them appropriately .
Uh besides soli - , solidarity is not only important in a team , but in society itself , for all teams are part of a society , it is obvious that you will need this quality to work .
