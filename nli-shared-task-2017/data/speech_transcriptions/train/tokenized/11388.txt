Uh I will suggest ocean park in Hong Kong because-it 's one of the biggest park in Hong Kong for having fun .
And ocean park if about dolphi whales , all the marine animals .
And you can , this actually is a , just like a Disneyland .
But is and have more fun above the water .
And you can have , you can just bring your swimming suit , go there to have fun and you bring your student often , often to come here to watch some show by dolphins .
That 's why I think is , br - I will bring m friend to go to there .
