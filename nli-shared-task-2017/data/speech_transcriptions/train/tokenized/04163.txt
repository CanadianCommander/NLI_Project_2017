In Germany a lot of popular place to see and visit , so uh I would take my friends from another country to the capital of my country which is Berlin .
Berlin is the biggest city and it has a historical uh interesting feature which is that it was divided between the forty years of the uh former German republic and the German republic .
So it has a wall which can be visited and it also has two different side , the former eastern side and the former western side .
The people are different the food is different and the sides of course are different too so it might be really interesting for people from other countries to see it because another country does n't have experience in that political problem .
Beside that there is food and people who are interesting .
