Last year I had the opportunity of going to Paris to study within the Erasmus Program and that was an opportunity , it was very important because it allowed me to learn a new language , French in this case , to see Paris that is a beautiful city that I had ne - never seen before and to meet a lot of people , some of them I 'm stil in contact with and , and spend some time away from my family and that was a good thing for my own uh independence and .
