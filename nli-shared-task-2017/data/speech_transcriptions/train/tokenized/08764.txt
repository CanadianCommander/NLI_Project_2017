I was given a special opportunity of being the process coordinator of my team when I was working .
Uh I was uh as apart of this job I was supposed to uh see that the processes are properly followed and implemented by all team members .
This opportunity was special because at that time process the uh , my organization was not even certified that it is no processes while officially implemented in the organization , therefore it was a good chance to uh prove my abilities uh in implementing processes .
Um , uh also uh it made me stand out from other members of the team who were not given that opportunity .
