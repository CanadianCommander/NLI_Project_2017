Uh one book that I read is called Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman and this book is highly interesting because it 's made on prejudice and racism and the story is about two lovers , where the girl is is black , African-American and the boy is white .
So the , there 's conflict between the families and also there 's social uh social status issues since the girl is rich and the boy works in , in the house of the girl .
Uh when I read this book I felt empathy for uh the lovers of the story since when , you know when I , I love in that situation I understand their situation .
