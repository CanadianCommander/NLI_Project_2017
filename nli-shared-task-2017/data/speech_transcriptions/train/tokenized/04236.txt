An interesting book I have read is uh a book written by Durrel that is State of my Family and Other Animals .
And this book uh talk about uh the childhood of the author uh they did n't passed English with his family .
The author uh talk about a lot of funny events that happened in his childhood and I think uh this book is very and interesting .
