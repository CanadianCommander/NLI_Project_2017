I like read in my free time because I 'm because I have to read and look a lot of uh topics related to my um um profession .
So I enjoy that I have to read something which is a little bit easier and makes free .
So for example I read a lot about clothing and know what is going in the world , uh what to wear , what can I buy where , what are the prices differences .
The other thing I like is uh health related topics .
So um where to go , where is the best doctor to meet .
Um where I can I um get some products for my skin and uh all these kinds of different subjects .
And like I said in the beginning all well I think it 's easier to read somethings in evenings while you have to study the whole day .
