For me I think uh most uh and the first time opportunity from me is a job op - opportunity , because I remember right time uh I have for interview before job in a job opportunity .
And uh before uh interview I have a quiz .
The quiz is about can you handle this job or not .
But I did n't got uh get a good grade from this quiz .
But during the whole interview I told the uh supervisors how I how I desire this job and I will work very hard for this job .
So the supervisor gave me the opportunity for this job .
