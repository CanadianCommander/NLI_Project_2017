It 's sure that the most important thing that I would miss uh if I were away of my house would be my family members .
Because um I like to be with them .
And secondly I think that as I 'm not a much person I would n't miss uh the comfort of my house or like what can be my clothes and my own bed or and my bathroom .
So I would n't um stress the importance of my family members because I need to be with them and able to share uh all uh that I , I want to share my , my day the confusions .
And so it 's going to be very important for me to keep in touch with my family members .
