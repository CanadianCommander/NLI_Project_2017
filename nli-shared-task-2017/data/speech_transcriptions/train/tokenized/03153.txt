What I miss most about home when I 'm away I 'll have to say is my bed because it 's then most comfortable bed in the world I like to sleep .
Um I miss home cooked food in my room more space which I like to sit work and think in .
And I miss my family and friends , family who mostly live here and I do n't usually see anyone I 'm away from this country .
And my friends who I 'm going to leave by the end of this year because it 's my last year staying here .
And my school because it 's the last year at school as well .
And I 've liked , I 've enjoyed being there more for the years I 've spent there .
