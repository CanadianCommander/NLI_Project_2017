For me , the special opportunity it 's that the coming to America to study English at America .
When I was in Japan I was studied about English but I could n't improve the skill of English .
So I think there are many opportunity to improve the E - English in America so that 's why I think the learning of English is very important for me and also there are many opportunity to understand American life .
It helps me to understand their English in America .
