A special opportunity that was given to me was uh the fact that I could study in um abroad because I live in Italy but uh as my mother is German , I decided to study in the University of Regensburg in Germany .
And I think that it was a a big opportunity for me because it uh allowed me to make many uh improvement in the language and as I had to live alone uh I could uh become much more mature and this is why I I think uh it was a really important uh opportunity for me .
