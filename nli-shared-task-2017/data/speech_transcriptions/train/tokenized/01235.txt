Lawyer , the most books , I read are about law .
So I want to tell you about a book which is about true man law history .
These kind of books is usually hard to read and uh in the beginning you do n't like it at all .
After , however , after a certain time when get it read and you understand uh the content a little better , it uh reveals different sides that make you understand uh all the questions related to the law much better .
So for example the church had uh big influence in uh to do development of law as well as the , the kings and the Popes and all these different status .
