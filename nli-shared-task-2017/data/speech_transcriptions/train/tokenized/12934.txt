Well a very important accomplishment it actually it was a few weeks ago it was to to GMAT .
Um it was very important for me to get a good because I want to go on NBA and I need to get a very good grade on in order to get into the university I want to go .
And also I can not afford to pay the universities so I needed to get a very good grade in order for me to get a scholarship .
So I study a month or so and uh and I got exactly the graded that I needed , that is six hundred and fifty .
That 's the minimum grade I needed to first of all get into the university and second of all be a candidate to get scholarship .
So it could n't have been better .
