Well one thing that I can say that most bout South America is my family .
The people I love , they speak in Spanish .
Um my family especially just because it 's uh we are very close and especially my mom .
I have a very close connection with her and I miss her a lot .
My two brothers are very part of me as well .
They 've taught me so many things and it 's hard to live without them though .
Um now talking Spanish , is very hard for me to make um good friendships here just cause of the language here not the same .
You change cause your personality and uh way to talk , you can because it 's just very different from what you are really in your home town .
