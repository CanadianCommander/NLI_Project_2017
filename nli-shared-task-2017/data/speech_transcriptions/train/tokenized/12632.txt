If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country , I would suggest the capital of Germany , Berlin because it has many sites which are both historic and interesting .
For example the Panbu Ghatu .
Um it 's also a modern city .
Another place I would suggest would be the Baltic sea because of its nature and and uh somehow you can swim there and the weather is often nice .
