From my point of view what I miss most about my home when I am away is for example the food is uh something that I miss a lot and of course my friends , the relationship that I left in my country , um family , my parents .
Of course um I miss speak with a person who is from my home country .
I miss uh my language to have a conversation um where I can talk about all I want .
