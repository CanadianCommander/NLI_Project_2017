I chose novels , magazines , poetry give a good look .
I share about the literature and the English we sp - speak .
I prefer magazines because they are more interesting , they share more information about the world and they give more news about me .
I can understand each and everything from the magazines and I can uh learn new words and new phrases .
Poetry is my favorite pastime also because poetry gives me good idea of what the very thing issues .
Novels are not a big one but novels will give me a good idea also .
The and I wanna simply say that at a free time , I want some read about first of all magazines , and then I increase only .
Magazines .
