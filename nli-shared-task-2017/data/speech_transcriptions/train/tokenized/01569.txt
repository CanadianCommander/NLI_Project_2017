In my free time I enjoy reading biographies and autobiographies of great world leaders and how they came about in the position of power .
Basically what I learn from the great life stories is how despite facing hardship they never dropped out .
They yielded the fruits of the perseverance in due course of time .
I 've also learned how that black was made part of their lives and what I find still interesting is there is always something I learn while reading about great lives of great people and something I can in my daily life .
