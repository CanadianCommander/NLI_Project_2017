There are several things that I miss when I 'm uh away from home .
Firstly it 's my mum and her cooking because whenever you 're uh uh on a trip cooking is never as good as you expect .
Also I tend to miss um sleeping in my own bead because hotel bedrooms seem to not have the quality of your own bed and also when traveling you never have uh all your clothes which is not always as recommendable as you expect .
But um one of the things that everybody tends to miss is his friends and going out to places you know and are familiar with .
