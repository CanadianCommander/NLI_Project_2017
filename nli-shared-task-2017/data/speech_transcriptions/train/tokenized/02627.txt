What I miss the most when I 'm far away from home is um of course my room uh in which I , I live si - sinnce uh I 'm uh four , four years old .
So of course my bed , uh all the decorations , uh my desk um but also , uh I also , I would also miss my family of course my two sisters , 7 my dad .
Uh every now , everry morning and every night when I , when I wake up , and I wanna go to bed , I see them and so uh it will miss me if I , if I had to go away for too long .
