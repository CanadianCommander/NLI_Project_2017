Um I like to read magazines more than novels because magazines have more like it 's more interesting than novels because novels like there 's a lot and like you have to keep on reading and you ca n't try , know the story without reading the whole part of it .
Uh magazines like most of it 's funny and I like to read uh like famous people and stuff like that and use things like < % > things like that .
And that 's what I like about magazines .
But novels , I never , I like , I do n't remember even reading them like when I was young and that 's uh I never again , I never read novels again .
