Uh when I 'm away uh from my home um I miss most the my family and my friends obviously .
Uh and the rest is mostly if I 'm in a very cold place , I miss the nice weather in Turkey because uh the winter is not that harsh and uh , and the general cultural aspects .
And the warmth of a Mediterranean country and uh speaking in your mother tongue .
And this is especially true because at one point you 're tired of talking in a second language even if you speak it in a very precise way ; in a very fluent way .
Uh these are the things I miss the most .
