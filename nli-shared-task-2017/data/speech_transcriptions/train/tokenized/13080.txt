Um a special opportunity that was given to me was a practical time that I could do in the Isle of Sword um at the North Sea .
Um I applied there here before and uh to do a practical time of eight weeks .
I learned to know the whole environment of the North Sea , the animals and a lot of people and I learned to know um an individual life .
Um it was the first time I was living uh away from my parents ' house and away from my parents so um I I got a lesson uh uh I got a in this time and I did still know a lot of people and their friendships and uh I think it was very important to my development .
