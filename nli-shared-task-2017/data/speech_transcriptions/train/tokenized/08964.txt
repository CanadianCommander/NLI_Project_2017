Well the requirement that was for me very hard , it 's to came over here to Germany because of the language that I had to learn .
In the beginning I had to learn English of course then I went to England for one year , started learning all the time .
Then uh I came here doing my masters in engineering and energy technology .
So of course I have to speak German well , so that I 'm taking some classes and was very happy because it all the knowledge that I have achieved in the university into an English < % 34.6 > , it was very difficult .
Some variables have different names , and formulas and the theory for article part as well .
That is good , I 'm very happy doing that .
