An interesting book I have uh read uh recently is the Lord Of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien .
I think it 's very interesting not only because the story is very interesting and funny but uh also for the with the adventures of the characters of the book with uh some uh important topics and the the important events of our century like the Second uh World War or the um the battle of the oh um .
