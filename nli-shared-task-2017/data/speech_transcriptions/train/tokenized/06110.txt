Yeah mainly um the accomplishment was to get my bachelor degree , um it was very hard uh to get it .
I had to prepare many things uh to write many tests and um yeah I had to convince many professors like it is always when you have to study uh you have to do so many things and you can never be sure if you 're doing the right uh things .
Uh so for some students at least they have to repeat some tests and uh uh yeah you have to write thesis or many report and it 's all very difficult and some things are really new for you .
Yeah it 's very important for me because I want to get a good job and I want to have a good grade .
That 's why it was most important for me .
