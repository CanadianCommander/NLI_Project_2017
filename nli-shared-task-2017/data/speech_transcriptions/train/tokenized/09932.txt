In primary school , I was a teacher 's daughter and actually the two teacher 's daughter uh in the same school .
And every , all the teachers knowing me and they um they did n't behave me like I 'm a stranger and I did not feel that um first being stranger um feeling that , that creepy feeling um ever in my childhood .
So it was really important for me um to adapt to a new place , to adapt to um to new class of me and um it was also uh motivating me for my uh lessons .
