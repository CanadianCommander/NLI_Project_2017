If friends coming from another country we 're going to spend time in my country , I would definitely take them to uh historical monuments of Lebanon .
Lebanon is know for uh several historical monuments such as uh the columns of and uh other monuments like that .
In addition I would take them to uh the down town of Beirut , which I think is very uh , is very nice and very particular because uh in this down town uh , this downtown has been built uh several years ago and is very ancient .
So you have uh , you have a lot of beautiful things to see there and it is a very uh , it is a very nice place .
In addition I would take them to Lebanese mountains to have ski .
