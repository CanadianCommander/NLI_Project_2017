My opinion on interesting is the novel of The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold .
I am of this opinion for different reasons .
Firstly , the protagonist is a fifteen year old girl who is raped and because I am the same age I can identify with the protagonist .
Additionally , the problem of rape is is also a problem that kills in our society .
Finally I do know the author of the novel and so I 'm quite familiar of her way of thinking and and these are the reasons why I think that Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a very interesting novel .
