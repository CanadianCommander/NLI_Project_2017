I got the opportunity to enter the audio engineering master in the University of Milan and uh it a really important opportunity for me because uh since music and audi - audio engineering is my hobby .
I would like to turn it into a job , and um to make it a job I need some academic training and uh besides of uh what uh I learned during my life .
And there is uh , there are a lot of interesting subjects and uh I think uh I 'm really lucky to have admitted into it .
