Harry Potter is a book which to talk about .
It 's just a book that shows the strength of the boy was orphan an orphan who works and the time he fought with the evil and he 's he 's still unaware of that he was great wizard .
The simplicity , that down to earth , the devotion , the determination and the dedication to his world shows that how he really accomplished all those things and came about all the evils he eliminated .
A very important thing is that no matter that he did not have his parents but still has the strength and work together so he can really face the world .
That is the reason I feel that Harry Potter is most interesting book known for people for all of us .
