What kind of reading material I like to read on my spare time ?
Well , basically novels and magazines .
Nobel novels because of the simple reason that I give a chance to imagine and travel to all the places that I 'm not able to be there .
You know the authors such as GarcÃ ­ a MÃ ¡ rquez , I love him .
He writes and make me imagine things that I wou - that I 'm not able to .
So like to of the read them because I tend to imagine and uh travel myself to other places .
Magazines just for the fun you know , the gossip for the artist to see what 's in trend and just because I 'm a girl , I like fashion .
That 's about it .
