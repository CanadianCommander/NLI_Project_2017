I believe that uh what makes a team member valuable um is his ability to work in a team actually .
Uh indeed he will be able to work under pressure in the group .
As for instance um during uh in when we are working under pressure many conflicts rise .
So disability to work in a team will make him behave differently and he will try to contribute to a team .
This will be his first priority and therefore , he will really work towards the goal define by the whole group , he will not focus on his own .
