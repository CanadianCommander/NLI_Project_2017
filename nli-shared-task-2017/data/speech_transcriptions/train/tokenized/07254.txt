I hope I can work as a doctor , um I am studying now pre medical science and I want to join a medical school .
And the reason why I picked this , that major because four years ago I had a car accident with my family , and my little brother die there .
Before he die he was surviving between my hands but I could n't do anything .
That piss me off because that 's when you 'll see somebody is dying in your hand and you ca n't help him , because you do n't have the enough knowledge .
You want to study the things that will help you , help people and to be a good doctor .
I 'd like to see every body fine .
