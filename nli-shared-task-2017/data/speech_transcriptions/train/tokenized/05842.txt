Well the special opportunity that was given to me is being here .
I was in Japan until I was fourteen years old then I need to come US for five years for my dad 's work .
First , I was anxious about being here as a student studying with a bunch of American people but right now I think that was big opportunity to me because I could learn English and another culture and my view of thing - things are widened because of being here as a student .
