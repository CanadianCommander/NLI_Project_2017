Well first of all I should say that I live with my parents , so when I 'm away I really miss them and the way that they take care of me and that they help me with all my problems .
In addition I really miss uh my home food , I do like it and I do n't really get used to eating uh foreign food , this is food from other countries .
This two things are what I miss the most when I 'm when I am away .
