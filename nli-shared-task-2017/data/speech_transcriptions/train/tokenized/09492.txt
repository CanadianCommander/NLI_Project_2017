I would like to be a pastry chef .
First of all I believe that sweets make people feel happy .
For example when I 'm depressed I eat chocolate .
Another reason is that I basically love cooking and um making and making sweets for people or um baking something I like would be interesting and for my future career I would love to be a pastry chef .
