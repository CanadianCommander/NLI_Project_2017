Well what I miss the most when I 'm away home is the everyday things the common things , is not only my family and my friends which I miss a lot is my street or the park that 's behind my house .
The smell of my room or the sound the sound of my mother hearing when she goes and .
Um I 've been out of my home a few times already and for studies , I 've been abroad and what I I carry always with me are photos from uh the streets or my city or the parks .
