An interesting book I read about is Alice in Wonderland .
I found the book so interesting because uh it speaks about the uh experiences of the little girl Alice uh as she goes into a mysterious land where she meets people who have their quirks and are very very interesting .
Uh for example uh she meets uh Humpty and Dumpty who sit on a wall and she meets the uh Queen of Hearts and many many more interesting characters which we could not relate to in real life and yet we find them so realistic .
So Alice in Wonderland is one book that I thought was really interesting .
