I got the uh fellowship from the foundation four years ago .
And the that opportunity was very special for me and I went to the University of Florida as a graduate student and I did some research on the electrochromic properties of the polymers .
And I published four , four papers in the international journal so like that I uh get a lot of information on the new subject that gave me a broad horizon in the uh chemistry .
