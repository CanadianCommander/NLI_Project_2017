When I am away missing quite a lot of things .
Um first of all there 's uh my family uh who I really miss .
Um my parents and my brother .
We 've also got two dogs and I 'm quite used to them so I always walk them in the park and I miss that .
And so there are other things um for example the food .
In uh countries in other countries when I 'm away um they have got difference and so I miss the food I get it home such us um noodles and potatoes and um sausages and I also really miss my friends when I 'm away .
They are really nice and uh yeah .
