I would like to read uh novels in my free time cause I like things to be imagined in my own head .
If you read the writings without no pic - without pictures , it help to absorb the information more correctly and it also helps me to gain more knowledge .
Which I can use in my later life .
Also my friends are goo - uh great leaders and we always talk about different books that we read over the weekend during the lunch time .
So it helps to organize my thoughts and be knowledge and have like some spend like pretty like interesting time with my friends .
Also reading novels , really helps me to become creative because a really art person and I like to enjoy drawing the things that I read about .
