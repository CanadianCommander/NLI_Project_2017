The Outsider was an interesting book I read written by who 's a French author .
Uh I read it a couple of times because I thought it was uh really effective the way the author uh portrayed the the situation of an individual in the world that we live in today .
Uh the main character has affected me deeply because you could follow his uh reasons and his why he did certain things and actions were really interesting also .
