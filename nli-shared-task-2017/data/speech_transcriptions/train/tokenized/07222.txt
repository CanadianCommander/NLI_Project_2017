Interesting book I 've read is called Into Thin Air and it 's written by a journalist called Jon Krakauer and it tells a story about a commercial expedition to Mount Everest in nineteen ninety six which uh was organized by two very well trained climbers but it turned out into a disaster because the people they were taking to Mount Everest were not trained enough .
And uh one of these people was the journalist who actually was uh involved into the expedition and after surviving this disaster he was left uh analyzing the causes that uh led unexperienced people try to climb Everest .
