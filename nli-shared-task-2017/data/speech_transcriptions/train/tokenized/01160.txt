One accomplishment that had me to work really hard is when I organized a technical festival in my college .
It is uh very important to me because I was assigned the work and I was the head coordinator of the entire event .
The event turned out to be a grand success as there were a lot of people who attended the events and took part in the various workshops and the technical events which had taken place .
There were guest lectures from outside which I was able to coordinate very successfully with the help of a lot of volunteers .
The staff as well as the students were very happy because the event was a grand success and I had got a lot of recognition , thanks to the event .
