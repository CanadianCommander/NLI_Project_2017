The interesting book I have read is a book about uh nano-technology um because I 'm curious about what is the meaning of nano and it shows me uh it is , nano is just a scale and it shows the function of carbon nano two and how how to use the carbon nano two in conducting or some other application .
So I think this uh very interest and useful for knowledge .
