For me what I miss most about my home when I 'm away for example on a trip or to a friend 's house for a night over um I mi - I miss my mom 's cooking .
She always cooks for me all these great food that I can never forget .
Also I miss the comfort of my room , it has everything I need , my bed , computer my CD player .
It 's always comfortable when I come home and I can expect those things to be there .
So this is what um I always miss my home and I remember my mom 's cooking and my mom my my room .
