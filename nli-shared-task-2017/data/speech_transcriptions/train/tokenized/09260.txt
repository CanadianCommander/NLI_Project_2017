My top fes - accomplishment was write EAMCET exam .
EAMCET exam is basically my Engineering , Agriculture and Medical Common Entrance test .
It has got three subjects : maths , physics and chemistry .
And maths exam has got a hundred questions of very vast syllabus .
So I have to prepare a vast syllabus which I felt really tough and to manage time in the exam was also very really tough and which i achieved finally .
And because I 've got hundred questions to answer just in uh fifty minutes , I 'm sorry , fifty minutes .
And physics and chemistry section also has got hundred sections which we can answer in fifty minutes .
So the time management was very important which I failed many times but la - last I was successful in the final exam .
So this I guess was my successful .
