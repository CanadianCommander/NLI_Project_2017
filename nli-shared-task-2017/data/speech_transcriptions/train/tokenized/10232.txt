I usually read uh novels and magazines more than poetry .
I like magazines because I can uh look for information uh look for news and understand what is going on and what is current in the world .
Uh I study in economics so it 's very interesting for me to to learn about globalization and what 's going on in the developing countries .
I also like to read novels sometimes to change my mind to go into another world and it also gives me ideas for creativity and ingen - ingenuity .
So I also like to do novels from time to time .
