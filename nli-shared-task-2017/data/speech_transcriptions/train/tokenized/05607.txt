I miss my home terribly when I 'm away .
I miss the time that I spend with my sister and her children .
I miss the enjoyment during the festivals .
There large number of get-togethers happen and I 'm able to meet many number of people even in our family .
I miss it a lot .
I miss the play , I miss the playing days my kids with the kids , party , parties .
And I miss the , miss having fun and the food at home .
I missed home for a lot .
Because I love my mother 's preparation .
And seriously I miss her home a lot and always wait for the opportunity to get back .
