Mo - the thing that I miss a lot when I 'm far from my house is the distance because I 'm now studying in a different city in and I 've uh uh a lot of kilometers uh from my city .
I also miss my family and also my dog and I also miss my room because the room that I 'm now live in is very small and I do n't like it .
Uh then uh sometimes when you are uh uh living in a foreign country , you feel lonely sometimes especially when you have problems or for example uh when you have exams .
Another thing that I miss a lot are my friends because well now I 'm live , I 'm staying with some of them in the city where .
