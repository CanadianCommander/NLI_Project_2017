Well I would suggest to visit of course my city was France because it 's rich of monuments and churches and it 's uh the city where renascence uh , uh began actually .
And it uh consi - can be considered as a museum at the open air .
And it 's quite amazing to see and to walk into the cities and see all these castles and well there 's also a couple of museum I would like to suggest like Uffizi and that uh holding a number of different uh um paintings and sculpture which are very famous like the type the Michealangelo and uh < % 39.1 > and of course also all the region of Florence is something we uh I would like to .
