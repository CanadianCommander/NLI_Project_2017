I have been asked to choose a quality that I think that would make someone a valuable member of a team .
I think that one of the quality for a valuable member of a team would be the quality of communication .
How this person can communicate with the other members of the team .
Can the person have the ability to communicate it 's ideas clearly to express them with respect , to communicate them uh with honesty and um I think it 's really important .
Something also about the communication is how to express his disagreement when he disagree with one of your member of the team .
It 's important to communicate them clearly .
