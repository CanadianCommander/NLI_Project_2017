I enjoy um reading about auto - autobiographies , mystery and adventure novels such as the great works of Brian McCord because I think he 's a great author and I find lots of things that I can relate to such as the poverty and related and related things that my country undergoes .
Because as you can , as some people know my country has very lot 's of issues relating in poverty and the situation is not very pleasant and the books of Brian McCord really know how to how to put and how to make the feel .
