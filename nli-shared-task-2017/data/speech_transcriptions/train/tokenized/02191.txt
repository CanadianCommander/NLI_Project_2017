Well I was given the uh special opportunity to visit Australia when I was just sixteen and that 's and opportunity that uh not a lot of people have .
And this opportunity has been very important to me because um I had the chance to discover a new land and some wonderful places that probably I had never seen if I , if I was n't going to um this school .
Um to meet new people that now are my close friends , and also to make a s - severe improve in my English .
And at the age of sixteen uh two months alone in Australia also help me to grow up a lot .
