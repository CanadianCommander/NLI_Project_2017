Uh my uh most interesting book that I read is .
It 's about a book with a girl and a horse preparing for the races and I thought it 's interesting because uh it 's about success and wife and also I can give some examples for success .
For example , uh trains hard all the time to success but uh before one from the race uh she got fall , she get fall from the horse and she broke her leg .
So there is unfairness in the book and also she works hard and when .
