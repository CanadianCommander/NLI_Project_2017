Living in Paris right now but I 'm originally from Italy .
And um so if friends were to come visit me in Italy and since I 'm uh I was born in Rome but I actually live most of my life in Milan , this is Milan is probably a city where I would take them first because is the one that I , that I 'm most familiar with and um , so I would probably take them first to Milan and show then around a little bit .
Um take them around to walk , it is a pretty small city so people can basically walk around everywhere .
There is a few very nice monuments that are famous in a worldwide famous like uh probably also bring them to the stadium to see maybe a soccer game .
But also I would also like to take them to Rome um .
