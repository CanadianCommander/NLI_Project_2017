A very interesting book that I have read is Cien Anos de Soledad by Gabriel Garcia Marquez .
This is One Hundred Years of Solitude as translated into English .
I find this book very interesting and it was one of my favorites .
True to the fact that it shows an entire generation over time .
It shows how one family starts by populating an area and forming a new city .
That family then goes on through five generations of the same family until the family finally ends with the baby that shows the prophecy from the beginning .
This is the book that leads into uh the concept known as magical realism .
