I would would advice them to go to Munich for the Oktoberfest and uh because it 's very popular .
It 's a great uh fest and okay , you drink alcohol there but of course you do n't have to .
There are also other attractions like roller-coaster and things like that and you can eat well there .
Munich also has other attractions like uh the football stadium , also football club or soccer in American-English , what would be interesting also I would advice them to go in summer not in the wint - in winter because it would be too cold o - only in winter if they want to go skiing because The Alps will be near .
That will also be an attraction , to go hiking in the in the mountains there .
