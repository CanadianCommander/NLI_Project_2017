I like always to read in my free time poetry because I feel that poetry is , can convey messages more than words .
The composition of a poetry allures most because it has forms it has convey a kind of atmosphere first thing and they also convey a meaning .
So you get in a lot of things .
Also poetry is like uh some spaces left for your own imagination .
So a poetry can be your own thing once you read it , you get it in your head that you have read something that was your own and you have implied something of your own .
