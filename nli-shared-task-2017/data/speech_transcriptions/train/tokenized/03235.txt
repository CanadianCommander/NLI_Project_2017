Uh well usually I do n't get some free time for reading but whenever I get time to read I always go for the magazines .
I find magazines more interesting than the novels and poetry .
Uh because in magazines I can get lot of different materials to read like very interesting topics , interesting facts , some good stories , new inventions or current trends in societies which is very difficult to get in a novel or in poetry .
Uh reading poetry is very boring because it 's the same content every time but there always some new big issues of magazines and every time they come up with a new material .
So I find myself uh more interested to read magazines and novels or poetry .
