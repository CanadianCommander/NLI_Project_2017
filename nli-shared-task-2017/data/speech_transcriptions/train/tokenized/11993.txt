A special opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity to study at the university of Mannheim .
There are two main reasons why this is a special opportunity .
First of all at the university of Mannheim I have the opportunity to learn about a lot of different topics to acquire the knowledge that I will need later in my life .
The second one is that Mannheim is one of the leading universities in Germany and therefore there are a lot of students who have special talents .
And it absolutely fantastic to study together with those students to profit from their talents to learn from them and to just to have a great time .
Those are the two main reasons why Mannheim is so important to me .
