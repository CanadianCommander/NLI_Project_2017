The Great Gatsby will be a very interesting book I read um last year .
It had to say what it was interesting because the characters conveyed um they were very descriptive and conveyed a certain person in life .
So like let 's say um one character would have to uh represent a certain and then the other would have to represent another like contradicting society .
Um it would also be interesting because of the plot and how it was unpredictable I would have never that the main characters would have ended up dead .
so that made it more intriguing to read .
