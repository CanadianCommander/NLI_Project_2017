When I am away home the most , the m - uh the things that I missed most most would be the food prepared by my , my mother .
Well the reason why I missed uh the food prepared by my mother most is because well you know um on this uh outside home , or I i - i - is uh would be fast food such as as McDonalds fried chips , or things like that .
However , at home my , uh the food cooked by my mom are much healthier .
Besides uh the food prepared by my mom are quite uh healthy and very delicious in a way that I ca n't find it outside home .
And that 's why I miss it most .
