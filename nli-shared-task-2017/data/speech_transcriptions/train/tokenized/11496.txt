I think the most valuable quality of a team member is uh determination so that uh member could accomplish the team goals .
And by having a determination that person can uh have a effort and do whatever i - do their best to um improve their team good .
Without the determination they would n't be a good part of team because um they would n't contribute much to the team and .
