I think the best uh the best value for a me - for a member to team of a team to have is the spirit of group .
Because um when you play and I mean in a team you have to play with uh many other people and you do n't have to try to be competitive with them because um you you are play in a team and not just alone um against the other um the other member of team .
Uh second uh on the second hand uh I think the spirit of group can um um is important because you are you have to be be very kind with every people .
