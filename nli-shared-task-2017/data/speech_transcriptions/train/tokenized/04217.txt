Um personally if friends come from another country and want to spend time in my country uh the city I 'd like to make them visit is uh Paris because for me it 's uh the most beautiful city in the world and I have the chance to live here in Paris so I know it a little bit and I would be able to show them uh what is important to see and what is beautiful in the in the city .
So first of all , I would go to the Eiffel Tower because it 's the most um known um thing here uh in Paris and um it 's beautiful and it has a great view of Paris if we go upstairs and um .
