I think the most important opportunity I had uh during all my years of uh education is just this year when um they proposed uh to me uh to leave for uh for uh another country to continue my study .
So um this is a , a great opportunity because it uh gets you to learn another language or to have a better speech in this language .
And also uh learn a new culture and a new , a new people and I think it 's very important for our presentation to know other people .
