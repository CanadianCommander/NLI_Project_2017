A book that I 've recently read uh the Bible .
I believe that the Bible is a very interesting book because it teaches us how to live our life .
It gives us variables lessons on how to live our lives and it presents a variety of examples on people that we should follow the way they live .
For example like Jesus Christ , he showed us uh how to be good , he showed us uh how to greet people and that 's the way we , we should live , to use him as an example for us and also to transmit that example onto other people .
That 's why I believe that the Bible is a very interesting book and I think that everyone should also read it and learn from it .
