I think an important quality that a member of a team need to fulfill is his ability to listen to other people .
The performance of a team is often mainly um influenced by the team members input .
So it 's very important to include every team member 's opinions .
Thus uh team member who does not listen to another team member , can not include the other team member 's ideas .
This way I think , uh listening is a very important quality for a team member um to fulfill .
