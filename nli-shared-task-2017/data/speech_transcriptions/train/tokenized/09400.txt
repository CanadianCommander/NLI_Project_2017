The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was entering the college preparation center in Aramco , Saudi Aribia .
I prepared for this accomplishment and entering this cultural preparation center by studying really hard for it because it was a great opportunity to send me out off the USA and study at , and learn more about other cultures and other studies to help improve my country and my and the and the company that I 'm working for .
And I beco - also because I had no college to attend .
