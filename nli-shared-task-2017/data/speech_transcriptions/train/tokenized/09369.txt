A quality to be in a team is that you like to be with different people .
You have to be open and you have to talk with those people .
You ca n't be close and does n't talk to them , because then they wo n't be with you and they wo n't you .
So , I would say the most uh efficient quality is to be open and to tell them that you are a really nice person and to show them that you are this too .
