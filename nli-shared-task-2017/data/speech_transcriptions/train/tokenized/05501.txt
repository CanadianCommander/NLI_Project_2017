I wanna be a lawyer because when I was child my parents and I was evicted by land landlord and this experience made me believe that law is uh only weapon in our society .
And in US some people think as a lawyer infamous job because there are some greedy people like uh called ambulance chaser .
However my point of view lawyer can contribute to our society by solving much problem between the people and lawyer can contribute to our society today .
