The thing I miss most at my home while I am away from my home my mother .
I used to sleep with my mother is the same bed everyday .
So I can think about when my mother is not here by me .
When I went to a field trip when I was sixth grader I was so sad to sit alone .
I like to mother to talk about some story every night .
