One of the most significant and special opportunities I have been given in my life was the opportunity to move to the Dallas in the United States .
This opportunity although was uh a challenging opportunity as I had to come into a new society and a new culture , was something that allowed me to gain a better education , gain a different perspective in different cultures .
And not only learn different uh ways of treating people but also the different cultures and appreciate the variety of ideas that there are in the world .
Uh this personal opportunity has been very significant because it has given me the opportunity to excel in my interests and also look forward to my future .
And develop my interest on whatever I wanted in the United States .
