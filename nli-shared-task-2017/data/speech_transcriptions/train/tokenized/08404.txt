When I 'm away from home I most I especially miss my parents my home and my pet and everything for me my house my brothers .
I miss uh I miss I miss everything that I want because when you 're home everything is prepared from your mum and from your parents and the older brothers .
And if you are not no one is no one help you like your parents .
Home is the most important thing .
