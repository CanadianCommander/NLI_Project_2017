My hometown , home is Bombay , Bombay is a place where I have been born and brought up .
Now uh I 'm here uh since three years .
The most uh thing that I miss about my home is the uh food of the cooking of my mom , mama .
And my moms uh my parents of course my grandparents , I have my friends and relatives over there which I miss uh the second most after my parents .
The uh other things that I miss about uh Bombay is the l - uh life in Bombay which is so fantastic and on the fun and enter - entertainment one can have while one is in Bombay .
