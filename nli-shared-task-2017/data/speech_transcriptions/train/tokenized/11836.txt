I like reading all the three kind of materials like magazines , novels and poetry .
It all depends on my mood at that time .
I like reading magazines when I 'm interested in the current affairs and news which is known in the time of the morning .
And novels when I 'm in the mood of getting entertained or you know getting some imaginative information of some sort .
I also like poetry when I 'm I want my artistic behavior to get developed but if given choice between all the three types of reading material I like to read magazines because they provide you with a lot of knowledge base and which helps you to widen your perspective about this world .
