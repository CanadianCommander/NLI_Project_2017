One of the many things I miss of course is my parents and my family members because uh I have a quite enjoyable time with them at home .
Secondly I will miss my bedroom which uh in it I have a lot of my stuff , my clothes , my PC , my iPod my everything you know .
Uh one more thing I 'll miss is my fridge because I have a lot of food in it and I like to eat the food prepared at home actually because I do n't like the fast food and all the stuff .
So I think uh that mainly I 'll be missing my room as I said before .
