I would show my friends my birth place where I 'm still living in it is called Heidelberg .
It lies in the south of uh Germany and the attractive thing of , of my town Heidelberg is that it has got large areas of green and the big river Necker is going through the city .
So you have got very attractive nature , nature sites and of course there is also the big castle which come with it but you have to be careful because it has got very uh steep steps up to , uh the way up to the castle .
And of course , the night life in Heidelberg is very attractive , there are different clubs and bars where you can go to and have a drink with your friends .
And of course the cultural diversity is .
