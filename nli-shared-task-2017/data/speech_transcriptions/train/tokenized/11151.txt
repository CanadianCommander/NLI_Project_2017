I recently read a book by Dan Brown called uh The Da Vinci Code .
It 's a very very famous book .
Uh I found it interesting because it conflicts uh religious facts and scientific facts .
And uh it 's a great mystery novel as well .
It keeps you on your toes , you ca n't drop the book , it is so good .
You have to keep going on .
And uh you realize as uh the story progresses , you get more and more interested and locked in the novel that you just ca n't put it down .
And once you reach the end , it 's such a shocking uh , finale that uh you realize it was actually a good read .
And uh I advise anyone to read it .
