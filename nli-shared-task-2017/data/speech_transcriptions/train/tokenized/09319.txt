The book I 've read is Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky .
I find this book interesting because it talks about a man who believes in a theory of the superman .
Um this means that he believes that murder can be replaced and replaced by good .
He believes that murdering people is fine when you do it good deed afterwards .
I find this interesting because that is not the case for everyday life .
In fact it 's pretty brutal .
Um in the end he does not succeed and I fully support that .
