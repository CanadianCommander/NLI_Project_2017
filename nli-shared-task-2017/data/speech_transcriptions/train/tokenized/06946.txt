On one was that when I was in nine grade my astronomy teacher proposed me a trip to Chile .
First of all I needed to have the best uh testing uh grade .
Since I got the best testing grade I won the trip to Chile .
It was a marvelous trip since I went with one of my best friends uh to an astronomy camp .
We visited many cities in in Chile including Santiago , Antofagasta and uh the Island of Chiloe .
Uh this unique experience made me realize something valuable , that I could be many .
