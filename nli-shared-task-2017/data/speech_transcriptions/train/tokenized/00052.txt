The special opportunity that was given to me was um I was one time asked to teach English in a um elementary school .
It was really cool to talk with um kids and teach them English and the feeling that gave , the feeling that um helping them was really very good , it made me feel um very good since I helped them um in somehow .
And I kind of made a little it was n't alot of money but I kind of made some money that help me for , to run the little errands .
And it was really very entertaining for me to um teach kids English in that little school .
