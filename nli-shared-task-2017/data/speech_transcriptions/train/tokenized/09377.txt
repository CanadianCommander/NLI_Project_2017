Okay what I miss most about my home when , when away is of coarse my family because you do n't see them and you miss them .
This is the most important part of your life .
Another uh thing you , you miss uh when you 're away is your friends because uh if you do n't have friends you 're not a perfect person or uh .
But the most things you miss are your things , the music uh your , your bedroom , all you have there .
The , you miss all you have there , family , friends and your things , your possessions but of course the most important thing is the family .
