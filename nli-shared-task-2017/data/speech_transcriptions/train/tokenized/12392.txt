An interesting book that I have read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad .
It was an interesting book because it was about a man 's model journey in the heart of Africa , or the heart of darkness and his journey was not only to discover the meaning of civilization but to experience it too .
It 's an important aspect of what he learned is that civilization does n't mean only the civilization definition that we know as in in Europeans and whites but it also means self control and restrict from one 's self .
