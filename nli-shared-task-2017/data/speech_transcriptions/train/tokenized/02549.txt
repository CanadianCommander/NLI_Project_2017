Uh I learn a lot of uh , to make a Physic of Truth uh book written by .
And I really love the book because it was talking about a small girl of two and a half years old who was um , um talking about herself and the way she sees the world .
Uh in the book , she describes how adults , her parents did n't understand her .
And how they um come about um with wrong uh , wrong uh opinion about her .
For example they that she loved , she is when she was two and a half years old .
