I 've read the book Lord Of The Rings and uh from my point of view it 's a great book because it 's um it 's so exciting and let 's you into a dream world .
And there are so many characters in it which make it really really interesting and if you have seen the movie according you have read the book um it it makes really imaginable and so interesting .
And if you if you have just uh read uh three part of the book because it has three pieces um you you get a really good insight about the authors intention and about his his aims about um some themes here .
