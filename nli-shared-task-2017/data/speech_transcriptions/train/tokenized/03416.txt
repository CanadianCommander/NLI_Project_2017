I mostly miss my mom 's cooking because I I ca n't find it anywhere .
She cooks really nice .
In my bed too , it 's so comfortable and I just ca n't find it in other places and I 've missed my brother a lot when I 'm away because we are just too connected ti each other , he 's uh younger than me and like we fight a lot when we are together with my brother but like I miss him a lot because it 's too silent around me when he 's not with me and I can be as as comfortable as I am in a house when I 'm out so .
