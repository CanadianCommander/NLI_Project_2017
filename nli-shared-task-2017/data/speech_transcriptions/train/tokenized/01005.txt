Uh I think , a valuable member of a group uh should be very friendly at first , uh and uh always uh say the truth .
I mean those are very important qualities just to have a group uh or a team just to do anything .
I mean uh it 's important to be honest and to be friendly to everyone and so uh you could uh have a team doing something like sport or whatever , but if these qualities are not given , it is nearly impossible to do anything uh that makes fun or sense .
