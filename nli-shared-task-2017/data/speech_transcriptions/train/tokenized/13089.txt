When I 'm away form my home Colombia , first I miss my family because there is some .
I have a big big family and we always meet together and eat every weekend and enjoy the time together .
Another thing that I miss is the food because we have food with special ingredients .
And and here where I am is difficult to find it , also I miss the landscapes from my country and also the different times also temperatures .
We have uh beautiful uh mountains and beautiful flowers and also another thing that I miss is my music .
