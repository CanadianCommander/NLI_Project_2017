Well one quality I think that makes someone valuable member in a particular group or team is to have a maturity .
Well maturity is always comes first preference in any work group .
If you are mature then you are well in your group and your position is well .
I think maturity plays a rule in a group successes if all the members are immature and can having the ability to think for the better option for them then I the maturity plays a major rule .
And of course maturity defines the man 's behaviour which is a necessary for a group .
