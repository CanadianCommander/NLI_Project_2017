I think if I leave my home I will miss first my family and after my friends and my sports .
My family is re - really important for me , my father , my mother and my brother they give me a cozy feeling of home .
My friends also I have a lot of great time with my friends , we go to parties we have fun .
I think I 'd really miss them and also my sports , I am playing handball , tennis and I go skiing .
And if I go away I have to fit in new teams , I have to um search for new teams , and I think it will be really hard .
So I will miss all the family , the friends , the sports and of course my house , my house , my room , my bed .
