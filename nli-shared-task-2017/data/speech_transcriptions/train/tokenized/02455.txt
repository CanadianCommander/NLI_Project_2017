 that I am interest to read and to reading .
I read almost everything that I get my hands upon .
And I like reading novels and magazines and I like uh reading books about history science literature and I like to read comics , I like to read articles from the Internet but if I had to choose one genre and that I would like to read the most it would be novels and probably novels in English from authors in of the post world like Donna Leon , Thomas and so on because they are the ones who most uh appeal to me .
