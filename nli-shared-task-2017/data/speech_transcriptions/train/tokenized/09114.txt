An accomplishment which is really , which really really required me to work very hard was a degree which I opted for which was masters in business laws .
This accomplishment required me to work hard because of the following reasons .
First , the first reason was that this acco - this degree is a masters degree which I would have , if I do well I will uh get the degree along with the graduate degree which I am currently doing in uh the field of law .
Another reason why this uh require me to work very hard was because in my university we 're not really taught to answer uh logical questions , uh we basically do questions which are theoretical .
But this degree required the logical knowledge and therefore it was really important .
