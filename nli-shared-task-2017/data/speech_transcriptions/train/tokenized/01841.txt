Special opportunity is given to me uh be , it was being an excha - exchange student in U - United States because um I got so many friends around the world and I lived in a different country , I had a different family and a different school and also I learnt English better than um any - better than everything I mean other languages .
And now I can speak two languages in the same time .
And I actually had the best year of my life , I had a great year with the American students in the American high school and I just gain a different culture .
