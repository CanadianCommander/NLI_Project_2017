A special opportunity for me was uh my staying in the United States uh in um in the year two thousand after my A-levels .
This was not a common opportunity that every student has uh I applied for this uh job or internship at compa - at < % > corporation and I was paid as well which is not uh special for a student without any college education and just his A-levels .
Um yeah , I I went there for three months , I got a visa , I could work I earned money and I uh I was very lucky that a company was .
