Um the most interesting book I have ever read were actually two .
The Bible and the Quran and I was quite fascinated about the similarity of both books even though I never believed in the stories that have been written in the bible .
The Quran um gives a similar um answers to questions that I had um regarding the bible and they give a much better explain to how the world was created and for example it said that Jesus was a human being and not a prophet .
