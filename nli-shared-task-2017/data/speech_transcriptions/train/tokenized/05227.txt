Accomplish , thinking about the accomplish side it uh , I remember a lot of things like uh the job which I had attended and which I was selected and many other things but the most important I think was at the age of five or six , I ler - I learned bicycle .
I learned it on my own .
I borrowed a cycle from my friend , I rode it myself .
I fell many times .
It took me a lot of hard work to to make , to learn to ride it .
But finally I rode it and I showed it you know to my parents that I did .
