What I miss most uh when I 'm away is my dog because when you 're away from your home , uh usually people miss the familiar things and um uh usually people meet um unfamiliar peoples and they felt maybe strange and so I think it 's natural to miss something very close to close to each one and my dog is the thing that I , that is the closest for me in the house .
So I miss my dog the most .
