The most interesting book I have read is Five Point Someone .
It 's about a college uh , Engineering college , one of the premium institutes in Italy .
And it 's about three friends uh how they have uh , got admission into that college , spends their four year , and they have been average students .
The reason uh which makes the book more interesting is that the oldest students , they were like uh average students but what they have learned is the friendship they have in the college life .
