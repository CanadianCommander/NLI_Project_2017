When I think about a quality that makes someone a very good member of uh a team uh uh I think about the the tenacity which is one of the the main quality that someone can have .
Uh the tenacity um is the the quality which means that you you nev - you never take no as an answer .
For instance I think that mother Teresa um had uh had these great quality and um to make long story short , if a member of my group had the quality I can rely on him .
