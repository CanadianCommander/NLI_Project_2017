An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was uh last year when I undertook a master 's degree by research and I had to complete a thesis of uh about twenty thousand words which is rather long .
Uh it was quite difficult , I had to take quite a lot of research during the year and the writings were also quite difficult also that my supervisor kept uh ask me to edit uh rather often so it was quite hard to keep going .
Uh it was important to me because it was something difficult and it is the first step , uh rather a necessary step to study PHD which is what I am hoping to start uh next month uh once this TOEFL test is finished .
