If uh friends from another country were going to spend time with me , I would suggest him to go to Taipei because there are a lot of delicious food and a lot of modern architectures .
First I would ask him to go the department store which is unique in Taiwan because the department store in Taiwan is total different from the mall in America .
The department store is really huge and really big .
The mall in America is is just one floor and uh really big is huger than the department store in Taiwan .
So I would suggest him to go to the mall .
So I would suggest him to go to the department store in Taipei and enjoy some delicious foods in the department store .
