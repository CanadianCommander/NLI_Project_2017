The special opportunity which I was given was to conduct a seminar in my final semester when I was doing my physical therapy .
It was a great opportunity where I could demonstrate what I have learned throughout the years and what my abilities are and where I , where do I stand in my course .
I had the opportunity uh in which I could impress my lecturers and my principal and all of my colleagues .
I have uh a lot of knowledge about the subject which I studied and hence that was the best opportunity where I could prove myself .
