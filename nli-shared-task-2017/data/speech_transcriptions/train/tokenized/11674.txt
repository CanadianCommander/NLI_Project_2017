Um a special opportunity that was given to me was when I got a scholarship that allowed me to go to United States .
It paid for the , the plane for uh the housing and uh every , every money I , I would need in the while I was in the US .
And I manged to meet uh very different people , because they were people from all over , all across Europe and off course American students .
And I managed to meet them to improve my English and to , to discover another way of studying , because the study is studying in America is very different from studying in Europe , especially in France which is a very scholar way of uh studying .
