It 's very important to have a good team spirit when you 're a member of a team or of a group , because yeah I think it helps the whole team .
And it 's very difficult when you depend on other people , when you do n't have a good spirit .
And uh , and additionally uh you would be very reliable uh because when you are for example on the sports team or something , they depend on you and if you do n't have the team spirit and when you 're not reliable , it 's very bad for the whole team , not only for yourself .
