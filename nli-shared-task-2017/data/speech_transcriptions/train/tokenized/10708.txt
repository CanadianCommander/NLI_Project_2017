The first opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity of me going back to school because for some time I left school due to because uh due to some personal problems and financial problem but when my elder brother gave me the opportunity to go back to school and start from where I stopped was a big opportunity that brought back the dream that I always have .
So the opportunity that I would never forget and I thank God I 'm doing my best trying to hold on to the opportunity .
That 's why I 'm still in school and studying very hard to do the best I can to impress him for giving me such a great opportunity .
