Uh very interesting book that I have read is nineteen eighty four written by George Orwell .
I see I saw this book was a most interesting because first it uh it combines a lot of humor and also very very scary events that occur to the main character .
Moreover it 's like he gives a good explanation about the human nature and the way human uh human can behave in a peculiar situation of total totalitarianism .
I think it 's the most clever book ever written about totalitarianism and is almost uh it almost is it is it almost uh more accurate than a book based on .
