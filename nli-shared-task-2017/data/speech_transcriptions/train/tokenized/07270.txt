An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was to complete a project that on entrepreneurial development in which I had to interview a very successful business person by either making a visit in his industry or by making a telephone communication .
This was very important to me because I learned a lot of new things , a lot of practical knowledge that is required to run a business .
I also asked him about what were the challenges that he had face .
It was a very challenging work and to complete the project it required me to do a lot of hard work and then finally I got a A+ grade in the subject .
