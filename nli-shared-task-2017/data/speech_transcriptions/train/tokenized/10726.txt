I think the quality that makes someones a valuable member of a team is he should be frie - he should be friendly because if a person is friendly um most of people will accept her uh easily and uh will be work together easily and happier .
Um if one person is not uh friendly and he uh maybe something about sometimes very mean to others , people will not like him and then the group work can not be formed uh totally and then the tasks may not be finished completely .
That 's why I choose .
