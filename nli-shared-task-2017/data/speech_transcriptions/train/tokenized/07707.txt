I like I like to read novels very most .
Because the language I find I find it very interesting in the novels and it does n't need any brain to complete the novel .
Apart from that I can really identify myself with the character play played in the novel or depicted in the novel .
I also find language of the novel very easy and I like to read about romance and suspense which I get a variety of them in novels .
And also I can red a novel anywhere in the crowd because the language is so easy so even better distraction nothing ca - cause me to to not to understand the novel .
That 's why I go for novel all the time .
