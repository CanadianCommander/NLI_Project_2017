Recent book that I have is The Da Vinci Code written by Dan Brown .
The book are taught , are very profound uh , left a very profound on my mind .
It change the rad - it change the way I think , and it left , and it left a radical thinking .
It change the way I believed in religion and it 's , and it led me to believe that everything is not by adults .
It let me to believe in myself and let me to think in my own way .
The book tells about the life of the Jesus and the story of Mary Magdalene .
I think the book maybe a little bit controversial but it rather it proves it 's point that all that is not prove .
That 's all .
