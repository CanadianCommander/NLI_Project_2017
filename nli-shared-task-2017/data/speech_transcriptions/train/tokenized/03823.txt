When I was away from , what I 'm I what I miss mostly is my family um because I 'm not a very careful person and I was and really very easily get ill and when I was at home , whenever I get ill , my parents will take me take care of me very carefully and that made me feel really good .
Another thing that I will miss when I 'm away from home is food .
I ca n't cook well myself and I just um do not not feel comfortable when eat things that are not made by my I people in hometown because the coconut um things like are very delicious too and that 's what I miss most when are away .
