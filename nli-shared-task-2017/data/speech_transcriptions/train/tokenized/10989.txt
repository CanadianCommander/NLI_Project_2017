A very interesting book for me was The Diary of Anne Frank .
She was a girl that lived during uh World War II in Amsterdam .
I 'm very interested in history and I wanted to get um personal background information so that 's why I read the book .
Now I think it 's very interesting to see um how little girl responded and yeah experienced the time during World War II .
All in all , it was very um interesting and informational .
