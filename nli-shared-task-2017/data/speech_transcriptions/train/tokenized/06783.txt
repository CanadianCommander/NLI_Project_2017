Um a book I 've read is The Crucible by Arthur Miller and it 's about the witch hunt and the United States at the um an earlier time .
And reason why I thought it was very interesting is because I I 'm very interested in the um the topic of the witch hunt as a general and about like how the women all were totally innocent and were killed anyways and um .
Also it was very well written and the theme of like um of um accusing someone of something they did n't do is very um it stood out very well .
