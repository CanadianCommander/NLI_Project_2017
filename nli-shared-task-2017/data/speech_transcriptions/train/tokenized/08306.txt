well what I miss most about my previous life , if I can say it like that .
Uh well I have been in Austria for two years now and um what I 'm missing most is that I used to live in the mountains in a , in a small village in the French Alps where I used to what I used to skiing two times a week , things like that .
And making Daniel bicycle and it is not possible any more in Austria so that is the first thing I 'm really missing .
And the second thing is that uh my dad passed away two years ago when um , um I feel very guilty about leaving my mom on her own in home and this is the guilt which is hard to , to carry on and that is what I 'm missing most .
