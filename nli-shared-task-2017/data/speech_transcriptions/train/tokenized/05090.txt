Uh the most I miss when I 'm away from the home is the family support .
The family support is very important like in the examinations , family support can make uh large difference in the results of the examinations .
Secondly I miss the food because the food that is available anywhere except home is not good , so the food is very important .
Lastly , friends that are in the city they are my home .
That support from friends is also very important .
