Uh the most I missed about my home town when I was uh went to the Philippines for volunteer work with medical team , was uh most importantly uh was my family members .
Because uh I only went there and also France .
Because there were no any peers uh ; that is at the same age with me .
And also uh I really missed traditional food at the last in my home town .
Because there were uh very only foods , there are only fruits to eat .
So I really missed spicy food ; which is traditional food in my country .
