Although I do n't like to read to read a lot , uh i like to read very much about the uh Colombian author Marcus .
I read a lot of five , six books about him and and i think he 's it 's a very interesting theme because he describes a lot a lot about what he writes and he has created a like a personal theme like a personal style of writing .
And but I 'm not so i think that 's very interesting and it 's something he does he does very well .
