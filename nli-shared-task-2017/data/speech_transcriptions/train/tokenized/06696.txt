I miss most about my home when I was away is my parents , my neighbors , my friends and my school .
Firstly the reason why I miss my parents is because I lived with my parents for eighteen years and my parents did well to me and they taught me everything .
Secondly my neighbors they were very friendly and some people were from the same school as me .
Other such as an Ethiopian wife and husband they were very kind and they treated me as a family .
I also have a family who who who treated me as .
