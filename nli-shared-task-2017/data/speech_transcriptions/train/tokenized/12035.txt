This summer , I was given an er - an opportunity to study English at the American Center , American Language Center .
This opportunity was uh really important for me cause uh I 'm a French educator and uh it helped to improve my English in order to be able to go to an English university .
As you know , here uh in Lebanon , English is more important uh than French , and uh everywhere anybody wants to uh work he 's he 's gonna need the English so much .
I think uh studying English was really important for everybody especially for those who think about uh working out of their countries .
That 's why I think studying English was a great opportunity that I 'd given to me .
