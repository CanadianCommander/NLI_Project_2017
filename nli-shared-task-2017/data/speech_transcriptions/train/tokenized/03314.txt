If I have a chance to choose with uh which which job I prefer , I would like to choose the to work in a bank to expand my ability in finance which is I had majored in in undergrad and also to provide the bank with they have knowledge .
At the same time , working in a bank uh especially in Saudi Arabia is give you an opportunity to get an a higher salary and to have a clear path which you could be a manager or somehow and theory the theory you 'll use later .
And that 's why I wanna work in a bank to be an like a CEO somehow next future .
Thanks .
