Lately I have read uh The Lord of the Rings which I think is uh an amazing book .
I really liked it uh because I love adventure books and this is uh certainly the best uh adventure book that I have ever read .
Uh moreover The , The Lord of the Rings has , is full of images , full of imagination and it really draws your attention from beginning to end therefore uh I , I value it as uh as the best uh adventure book , perhaps even the best book I 've ever read .
For example uh it creates uh an entire new world uh full , full of new cr - creatures which are imagined by the author , which is great .
