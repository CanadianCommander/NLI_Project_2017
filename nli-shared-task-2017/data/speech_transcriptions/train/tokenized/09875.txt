Uh I want to discuss the book uh that is called Independent Independent War of Turkey uh because uh because I read this book because I uh want to talk about uh as a leader of Turkish army .
At that times uh the Turkish Army uh was understaffed and poorly occupied and uh let by inconvenient uh government .
Uh in these uh circumstances uh can be seen as a uh a great leader .
Uh this topic was mentioned in the book .
That 's why I really liked it .
