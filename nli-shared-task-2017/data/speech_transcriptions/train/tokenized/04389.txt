While interning at the U Embassy in Paris , France , I was given the opportunity by my um intern coordinator to work on a research program in the biotechnology field in particular researching policy differences and cultural differences in France and the United States to help further the biotechnology related and genetically modified organism related issues that separate the Transatlantic um cooperation on this topic .
And thus I was able to research and give the staff guidelines .
