I feel that I I was required to work very hard to get an admission into my medical school because right from my childhood I always wanted to be a doctor and after I worked for three long years , actually when whenever when I failed to get into the medical school for the first time I was really emotionally upset and that put on a huge burden on my brain and for the next two years I had to work much more harder than I 've worked before and also I think uh one more reason uh why I I was to work hard was my brother was very much settled so I wanted to have an equal and equally prestigious settlement for myself .
