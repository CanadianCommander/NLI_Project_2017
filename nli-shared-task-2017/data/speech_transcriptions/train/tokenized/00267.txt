If I could choose any job I wanted , I would choose uh interpreters because , interpreters can deal with a variety of , of areas and all of them are are the advanced areas spec - technicals and special areas .
Because the areas that need interpreters are really like international meetings or , or some kind of aca - academy society .
And there we can as interpretive is , I can know uh the latest topics in every , any kind of every , every area .
So I would like to be an interpreter .
