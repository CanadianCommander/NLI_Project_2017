Well , I miss a lot when I am away from home .
For example , I miss my mother 's food .
She prepares me very well .
And I also uh miss my brother 's love towards me .
Uh my brother he 's a elder brother and he 's very helpful to me in all ways .
And also miss my father 's concern .
Uh and especially I also uh miss my pet dog and I also miss my , all my friends over there at my homeland .
I miss them a lot as I do , uh as I do always loiter with them
