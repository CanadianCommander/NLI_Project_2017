I have read a very interest book called Catch-22 , which I like very much .
It is a satirical humor of the army .
I very much like the central character in the book whose name is Yossarian .
He is very humorous and has a very absolute view point about the things in life .
This book tells about how the people in the army are trying to avoid the duty during war , second World War .
They make up all kinds of excuses to avoid duty .
But some of them are also very adventurous and tend to accept every duty that is put to them .
In the end , it is shown how Yossarian escapes his duties and escapes from the army to go , leave .
