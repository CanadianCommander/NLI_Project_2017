Okay I 'm Korean now I 'm living in Japan .
And I have uh experience studying in Canada .
And the most the thing that I really miss at home uh was A dog ; my dog .
Since thanks to the internet , I can talk with my friends and family whenever I want .
But it is impossible to talk with a dog .
So the thing that I miss the most about my home in Korea might be my dog who can not email me or who can not call me .
And it 's impossible to talk to me .
So the dog .
