When I 'm away from my home the most important thing I miss is the love and affection of my parents .
The other important thing that I miss is the food that is cooked by my mom that is daal and rice which is also my favorite food .
I miss my friends dearly especially conversations with my best friend with whom I discuss my all details of whatever I 've done the whole day .
I also miss the hassle and bustle of the city because it is ultimately my home .
I also miss my neighbors my dog , my um my uh sister .
