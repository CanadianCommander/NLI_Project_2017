Being away uh I , I was kind of miss my social framework , so to speak .
Meaning on a like remote place there is no one to talk to , I 'm all by myself I uh not able to back referring to familiar places , familiar people , familiar intentions that I 'm always involved in .
So the feeling of being away is like well missing my usual environment being embedded in .
