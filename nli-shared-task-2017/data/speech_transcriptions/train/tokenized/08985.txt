Among uh reading material , and that is uh given in the question out of novels , magazines and poetry , I would love to read novels in my free time .
Uh this is uh due to the reason that it increases my imagination and the suspense uh that is normally there in the novels really thrills me .
Uh I 'm not limited to only novels , I also uh like reading business magazines .
Uh the fact that they provide me updated information regarding the happening trends uh and no - not only my own country but also to other with the effect of globalization uh I am able to reach uh the happening events throughout the world .
