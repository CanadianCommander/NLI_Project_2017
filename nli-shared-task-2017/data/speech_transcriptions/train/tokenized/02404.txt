When I was a high school student I used to read uh many foreign literature especially European literature because I was really fond of this topics .
Because this topics were the topics we used to to uh to read during the classes uh in my high school .
Then when I went to university I decided to study Japanese from Japanese literature and so I devoted on my spare time to uh to reading of the classical uh novels of the Japanese literature .
And uh it was interesting because um was really different uh from the novels and the literature I had read du - .
