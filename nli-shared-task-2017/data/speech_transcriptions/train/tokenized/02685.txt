When I 'm away I miss more my family and my friends and very much , very most my best friend Subrina , who lives far away .
Um I see her every weekend although the destination and uh yes we have so much fun together , I really enjoy it , .
And um then I will miss my mother um who just had everything for me , who cooks , who uh , who wash my clothes and um my sister who lends me her cloths and her shoes and my brother who is always happy and my father who is always there for me .
