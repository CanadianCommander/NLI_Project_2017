One of the biggest accomplishment I had was to raise money for a sick child .
A child father was very poor and he was not able to raise the sufficient amount of money to complete the operation on his son .
So what I have done , I have talked to my friends , all my colleagues and my professors so that we can raise the required money .
Uh people around me are not very rich but they contributed whatever they can then I visited the town and meet local people and convince them to raise some money .
This way I was able to generate enough money for the child operation and I think that was a very big accomplishment for me .
That 's all .
