If friends of mine came to visit Germany , I would first of all show the Hamburg because I live in Hamburg and I love the city and I think it has a lot to offer .
Um but of course um there are also other important cities in Germany , for example there is Berlin our capital and I think uh everyone who comes to Germany should have seen Berlin but um there are also around Berlin there a lot of concentration camps and I think all sorts of people from abroad should see them because they are really important for um the history of Germany and this also affected the uh history of other countries and therefore I think it should n't be forgotten and it should um uh really be considered as um .
