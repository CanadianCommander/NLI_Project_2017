The book called uh Princess of Veena .
I 've read it uh during the summer .
It 's interesting because it 's about her life , her personal life uh being a princess .
Uh she talked about the difficulties she has been through during uh her teenage life .
Uh she talked about her whole family , her father being the really mean to her and being really good wi - to the boy .
Uh I just enjoyed the way it 's uh been written .
It 's a classic book .
