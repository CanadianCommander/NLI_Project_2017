The requirement that uh needed for me lot of work was my MA .
I had to do a few things .
For example , I had to read a lot of material , I had to consult my supervisor , at the time I had to um go and travel to a number of counties in order to collect material .
I had to do a lot of fieldwork as well and this needed a lot of hard work and it was in it is uh it was very important for me to get my MA because this meant something .
As far as career is concerned , it meant that I could take a pause as a teaching assistant and it meant that I could also prepare for a PHD .
