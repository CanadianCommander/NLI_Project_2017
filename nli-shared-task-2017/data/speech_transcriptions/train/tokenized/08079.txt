If I want to choose a career I would choose pharmacy .
The reason why is because I have been doing this job for about a year and I have lots of experience .
And on top of that the experience that I have includes uh medical knowledge , customer service and good judgment skills .
And in term of medical knowledge I know lots of medication that are good for different uh disease such as I know that Zax is good for for anx - anxiety and also libido is good .
