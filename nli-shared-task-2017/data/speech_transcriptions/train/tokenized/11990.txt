As of particularly living basing by myself I miss about , miss Korea really really uh a lot mostly food and family .
I miss family because , of course I miss family because I love them and when I see people who were with family I miss them the most and how they loved me before and uh they they just they call me but it does n't really uh I it 's not the same as how I live with them .
And food , is the Korean food , I miss them so much because even though there are a lot of Korean restaurant near here by it 's not the same as made by my grandma that was a good cook and who made the best food in the world in my opinion .
So I like I miss Ko - Korean food and family the most .
