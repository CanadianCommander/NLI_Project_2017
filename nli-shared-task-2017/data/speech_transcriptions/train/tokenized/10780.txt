A special opportunity that I had uh occurred this year , at the beginning of the year when I started to work in OTF group it 's a consulting company .
Uh with this change I 've been able to practice and improve my English greatly .
And also I have had the chance to deepen my knowledge in the business area because usually I have to speak with head of companies and do interviews and also do some research job which is very important for the consultants when they are uh executing their job .
