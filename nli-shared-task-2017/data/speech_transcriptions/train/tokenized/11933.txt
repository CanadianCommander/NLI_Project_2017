The important thing that I miss when I 'm away from my home is my family .
I 'm a very family oriented person and I miss my mom , my brother and my dad .
Secondly I miss the food my mom makes , I love the food she makes , I miss that when I 'm a way .
I have a pet dog who 's who 's been with us for the last three four years and I miss him a lot when I am away from my house .
These are the three most important things I miss when I 'm not at home .
Thank you .
