What I miss most about when away from home is my parents .
My parents have been somebody with whom I have spent twenty years of my life and now to stay in a hostel away from them really hurts me .
Also what I miss is the home-cooked food .
That is something which nobody can hope to get in a hostel life .
My relatives and my childhood kins are the other people who I really miss when I 'm away from home .
Apart from these , my pet dog Chotu is somebody who , we can f - , he can not be fulfilled while I 'm staying away from home .
So these are in a nutshell the most important things which I miss while I am away from my home .
