I like to read stories that is novels on uh adventurous novels or comedy or on the real life stories .
I like to read to them only because of uh two reasons .
Primary , that we learn a lot by the experiences that have been written in the books and they 're more adventurous because then you read and you tend to imagine yourself in that position and try and relate and fill excited about the novel .
For example I have recently read a novel on a uh uh person 's life uh in and I 've got to know quite a lot of things about it .
Thank you .
