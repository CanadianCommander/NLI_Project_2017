I 'm actually not reading a lot in my free time .
Uh if I find time um I prefer reading uh some some uh magazines dealing with topics like economics or finance , that 's just my nature of study .
Um yeah I just try to to to enrich my knowledge uh with some details or everyday news um yeah , that 's what interests me .
Reading books is not one of my major um , I do n't spend major time on reading books or something like that .
Uh just like novels or romantic books as probably others do .
Um yeah , that 's it .
