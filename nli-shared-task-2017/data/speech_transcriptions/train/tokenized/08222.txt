I miss a lot when I 'm away from my home .
First of all obviously I 'll miss my parents , my relatives and my brother and my sister .
I miss uh miss their love and .
Uh whenever I 'm away from home I wo n't be having the same good old friends whom I 've grown up with and studies and uh daily spend most of my time .
Moreover when I 'm away I uh generally in for um some formal purpose some maybe pursuing uh education or uh joining uh uh an institute for uh some uh education purpose something like that .
So there I miss uh much of that so I have to work hard uh do , put in so , so many effort .
