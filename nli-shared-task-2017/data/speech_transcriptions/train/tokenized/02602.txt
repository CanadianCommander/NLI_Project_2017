I generally do n't find myself lacking anything that I have at home .
Right now I 'm away from home far away and I have discovered that I actually miss my dog out of all things his name is Rascal .
He is , he , I 'm just used to having him around I have had him since I was little so it 's strange that I do n't miss my family , I do n't miss my friends .
Well I do miss my friends , but not all of them some of them I 'm kind of glad to be away from .
But it 's my dog that I miss the most .
He during dinner , we give him our left overs and you know he 's an excuse to go for a walk so that 's what I miss most .
