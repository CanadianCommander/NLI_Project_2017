An accomplishment uh that required me to work very hard was learning French because it 's a very difficult language um which pronunciation is very difficult .
Um moreover it has a very um difficult grammar and uh you have to study very hard to learn it , but on the other hand it makes really fun and you can talk with people and so you can have a larger view of the things and therefore it was really good and important to me because I also was one year in France and therefore was learning French very important but very hard to me .
That 's all .
