I love to read Latin American novels .
I am a fan of Latina America literature because I Like the way Latin American writers talk about our countries and our cities .
I like to to read literature that is from the beginning written in Spanish because you can read the beauty of language and I really read what the writers is willing to take another translation but exact what the writer is is willing to tell in each word .
I love Mexican writers like .
