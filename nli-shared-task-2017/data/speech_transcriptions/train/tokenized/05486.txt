Basically I missed everything .
Specifically I missed my family , my home .
Like , the way like my normal life used to be .
I miss watching TV in my house .
Uh goofing around with my friends .
Talking to my family whe - whenever I need .
The , my basic life .
Everything ; the food , my culture , my traditions .
All that affect , affect me when I left , but , affect me when I left .
But I still .
