And the most of the uh I miss my hometown is the winter time .
Uh during the winter time my home town is very very beautiful and there are there are a lot of ice sculptures which is very uh it 's a typical thing in my home town during the winter .
And also I remember the happy time I spent with my uh friends , during the winter time we can make the snowman outside of my home .
And um and the beauty of wind snowing .
When when it was snowing in the winter uh we can uh go outside to enjoy the view .
Is all the color is all white , so it 's very .
