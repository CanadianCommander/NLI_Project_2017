When I 'm away from home the most things I miss are not things , they are actually people .
They are my friends and my family which are very important to me , but not only friends and family but also my animals .
I have a cat and a dog and they both are very and a part and part of my life .
Uh besides living things , there are also not living things like bread and bread spread because Germany has a lot of different breads and far away like for instance in the United stats or England , there are not uh so good breads and therefore I also um I also miss uh some of the food we have .
