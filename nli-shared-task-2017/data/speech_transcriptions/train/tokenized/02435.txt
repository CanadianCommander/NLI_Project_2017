Uh I had to prepare a proposal for a new project for uh students in Germany .
And this project required me to first uh develop talent in India and uh estimate how much uh people will be required , how much amount of time would be required and how many days would be required .
And it took me one month to do the task and finally we could prevail uh pro - produce a proposal and uh present it to the German team .
And uh finally we could uh bring uh project of uh one billion Euro to the Indian office and it was a great success and uh now I 'm busy implementing the project .
