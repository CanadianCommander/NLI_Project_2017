I personally relate topic because I myself stay away from my parents and of course most of the time I miss my mother 's love , my father 's you know , the ability to make me secure and making me feel responsible for themselves and to make them proud .
And you know , I miss the motivation from my parents that I have to make uh something great in my life and to make them proud and of course health is also an issue of concern and you know I do n't have anyone to remind me of my and to you know constantly keep me on my toes .
That 's what I miss and that 's it thank you .
