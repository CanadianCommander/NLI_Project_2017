I have read the Gats - .
Uh uh the book describes a society in which we have turned into .
It is , it also shows the shallowness of the people who lived during the nineteen twenties in the United States of America .
Uh the , that part of the story was very interesting because it turn out to be that the main character , Gatsby , turned out dying , and was n't able to uh achieve his American dream , or what we know as the American dream .
