An interesting book I read is that is in English is Ask the Dusk .
Uh I like a lot this style of writing of this author because uh it uh explain all uh he 's a um uh emotions uh are repeating uh uh the same uh concept many times every time with a different tone .
Um Ask the Dusk uh uh is about an Italian uh Italian man that lives in America and wants to become a bride .
I like it uh much so much .
