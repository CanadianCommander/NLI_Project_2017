In my free time I usually to read some magazines because uh I quite like to be aware of the politics , environment and situation of the world .
I usually buy some magazine uh on a weekly or monthly basis but sometimes I buy some newspaper to get special edition , for example the weekend edition of the newspaper .
Another reason why I found these uh kind of reading interesting is that you can several point of view from different writers .
Like if you read different kind of newspapers you can have a right wing or left wing point of views .
