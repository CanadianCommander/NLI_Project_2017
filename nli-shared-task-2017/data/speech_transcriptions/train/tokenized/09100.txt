The special opportunity given to me was serving the community .
The reason why I think serving the community is important because uh my parents taught me the kindness and respecting the people .
As I give the respect and helping the others the same way I get back help from others .
So I think serving the community is one good opportunity , not only for the disabling people , people who need me .
