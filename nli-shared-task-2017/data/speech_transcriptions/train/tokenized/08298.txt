Okay , I do miss my , my home when I was away .
So last year I was on a trip and I have to be the part of my family for five days and I miss the most my family because I used to talk with my family all the time but there was no time to talk with them ab - about everything .
And the second I missed is the television because I watch television everyday and each program was decided but that time I could n't watch anything .
And the third one was the computer and I used to play computer with my brother but when I was in trip I could n't play a computer game with my brother .
And that was the three things that I missed when I was away home .
