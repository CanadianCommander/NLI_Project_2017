I would miss the Japanese food when I am away from Japan .
The main reason is that Japanese food food is very familiar to me and I always uh have have eaten it for long time as as long as I live in Japan and when I for example , when I went to America as student exchange student I always ate fast food so much so I miss the healthy healthier food and I thought Japanese food is the best food for me .
