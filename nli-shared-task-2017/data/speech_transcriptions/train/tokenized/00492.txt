Well now I 'm studying in at home I , nobody knows his brother is there .
And what most I miss from my home it 's well something like only a sofa to lie and to watch TV .
Uh kitchen to open , to open the fridge and look what it 's inside , what food you can take .
And my sister um shouting out every time and uh going into my room .
And my father and my mother and uh I had , uh upstairs in my , in my , at my home , I have a small room where I can uh sit down and read a book .
And it 's relaxing and I miss it a lot .
