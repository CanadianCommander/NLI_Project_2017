My greatest accomplishment is the the day the day when I played cricket for my school team and it was uh it was greatest day because I scored century on that day and it took of about three to four months for me to practice through out day and night uh in the field and toil out for this and days of the three months .
And also uh on that day I received a trophy for being being the best batsman of the day .
So that 's my accomplishment .
