Well when I was learning how to ski it was really hard for me and um it was important to me because everyone in family ski 's and I want to and be as good as them .
But it took a lot of hard work , a lot of falling down and hurting myself and I was also um getting ready to enter the races , the ski races and so it was very hard to just prepare for it .
