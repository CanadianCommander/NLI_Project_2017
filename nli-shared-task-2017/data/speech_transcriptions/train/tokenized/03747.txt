One of the accomplishment that require me to work very hard everyday is the fact that I have uh a pet , a dog uh like a year ago .
And uh I have to wake up every morning really , really early like six thirty since I have university at the same time and I have to go with him to be uh , to the street .
It 's really uh stressful for me because a couple of reasons .
First of all because I need to sleep more since I have to work alone in the university .
And second because it 's kind of boring since one is in the street at time .
So I guess this is one of the accomplishment that requires me to work very hard in my day life .
