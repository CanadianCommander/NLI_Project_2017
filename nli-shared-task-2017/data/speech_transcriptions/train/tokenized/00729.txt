Adaptability is the nature which is popular among the team mates .
A person who is popular who is adaptive will be popular among the team-mates .

This is what is required in a teamwork or a group .
When you 're with the team or a group you need to understand the demands of all the people and adjust according to their nature hence adaptibility would be is the most important a quality which makes someone a valuable member of the group .
