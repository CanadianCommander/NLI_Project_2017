If friend of mine were um to spend time in my country , I would uh suggest him to go and visit Bodo .
Bodo is my home town .
And uh there are two main characteristics in this uh beautiful city .
Well first , its architecture .
It is a very coherent eighteen century architecture , which has never been destroyed by any war during the past .
The second reason why I would advise this to him is uh because of gastronomy .
Gastronomy is uh a very important tradition in the city because of wine , uh because of wine , of course but because as well of uh dark gastronomy and dark cooking .
So Bodo would be my suggestion .
