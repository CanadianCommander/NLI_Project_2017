The most important , uh , the most , the best book I have ever read is The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde .
This books is gorgeous because um it contrast uh deals with the human uh values and life .
Contrasting two mothers , uh one mother is held by uh the protagonist , the , the , in society it appears very good and uh honest um , charitable , merciful .
But on the contrary uh inside in his pri - in his private life , is the opposite is , is bad , is uh careless of human needs .
So two opposite faces .
