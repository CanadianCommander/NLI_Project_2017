Miss more about my , when I 'm away my home is that my family .
I 'm too much attached with my dad and my mum and especially I love the coo - , food cooked by my mum .
And also like you know by the end of the day we all are working so when we meet we talk , we interac - about how was our day .
So I really miss all these things when I 'm away from my home .
I miss my family , my , each and every moments which I shared with them and I do remember like sometimes we 've had arguments or fight with my mum that I remember or some good moments which we share together and the cel - festival celebrations and all .
