I was an IT student in IU however I miss I miss the TOEFL test last week because I overslept which is very big mistake for me .
But however the school give me a special opportunity for me to apply level 6 .
Uh this opportunity was very , very important to me because I have a big chance to get into level six and I would n't be repeat .
And I also learn I should be on time in a different land and I should n't be overslept again .
