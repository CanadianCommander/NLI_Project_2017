The most important uh difficult accomplishment that I have faced is my project because it require lot of uh , it was because my very first uh expe - uh experiment .
And the , it call for lot of experience .
Our project deal with the uh two , that the light must blue when in the , uh not in the morning where , where I see the light .
And uh for this we need to uh line by line what is required and how , how should it be done this process and these steps that is needed to reach a target .
Also the fan must be on both in the morning as well as in the evening .
So it required a lot of experience and hard work that really hard to put in .
And finally I was able to achieve success .
