When I 'm away from home I most miss the made food my mum prepares , it 's a wonderful thing and it 's very hard to get at .
And I also miss a lot of my friends that I have at home and some of them uh , I would say some of the friendships date back about twenty years so it 's really even I do n't see them so the good thing is having internets and emails uh but it 's really something different if you see a person .
And it 's also about asking people for well for some help or for advice so that 's what I miss and seriously especially while being in Asia I miss a lot of democracy uh that 's something I very much valu - value in Europe so that 's basically I would say the things I miss otherwise there 's everything else you can get in the country or away from home .
