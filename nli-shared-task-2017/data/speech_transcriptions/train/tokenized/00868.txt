I like to read magazines especially sports and current affairs .
These are the areas of my interest .
Uh current affairs magazines they give a lot of information of what is happened in the world and this keeps me in touch with the the current affairs .
Also I like to read factual books especially autobiographies or incidents which have taken place , historic events for that matter .
Geographical information which gives me quite a perspective of what the world is and how the world has evolved .
Apart from this I also like to read literary books like Reader 's Digest which people have put in their .
