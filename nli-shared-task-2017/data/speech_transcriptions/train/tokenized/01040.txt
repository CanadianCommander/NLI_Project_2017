What I miss most about my home is my family , also my room especially because it 's in it 's a familiar environment which uh I 've been living at all my life I have never left my home for a long time or for a very long distance .
Basically I live in a dorm now so it 's kind new experience .
I also miss my mom 's cooking my sister 's my dad um our conversations together basically yeah .
