The book uh , you know why I found it interesting is because uh , uh , the way the book , the way author describes uh love , uh love between a man and a woman uh in a very , in a very different way than , than the usual .
The author also uh , uh , the author also points out uh certain uh , certain angels to a relationship , the pros and the cons relationship brings along with just the love zest to fit .
And uh .
