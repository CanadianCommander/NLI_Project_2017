Oh gee , well it 's a bit hard to talk about the interesting book I have read book I have read recently uh since I do n't read the books very much which is uh a bit embarrassing .
Um but I did read one book recently which was uh which was on uh my favorite band uh which is U2 and I think the book is called uh U2 by U2 which is a which has a lot of uh interviews with the band members and it has a lot of incite to the uh the history of the band and about the record they produce and uh I think it 's uh really a definitive book on U2 .
