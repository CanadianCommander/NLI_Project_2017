A team person uh could be helpful if they become interactive with other members of the team , uh sometimes some , uh p - uh some situations may arise uh leading capabilities of them in need , and sometimes they should be supportive in terms of difficulties and they have to be positive in giving some critics to build up uh positive uh feedback to the people , and they should be helpful .
