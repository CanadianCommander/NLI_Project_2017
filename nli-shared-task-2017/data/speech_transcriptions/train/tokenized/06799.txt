The quality that makes somebody a valuable member of a team is courage .
Courage makes sacrifice of oneself possible this leading to a smooth cooperation among them .
For example when climbing a mountain uh there should be somebody who should sacrifice him or herself in order to make a smooth progress uh climbing the mountain and this can not be done without the courage because somebody who decides to sacrifice themselves must not be called in order to uh deal with the difficult situations that faces him or her .
