When I move uh outside my home the most thing that I miss is my parents .
Uh I miss my dad whose care is always there with me when I am at home and my mother who is whose lovely affection is always there .
Secondly , I miss the home food no matter where I go , the food no matter in restaurant I eat the food is oily and it 's never comparable to the food provided at home by my mom .
The food at home is much tastier and nutritious than those provided at the uh restaurants outside .
Thank you .
