The accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the examination of my diploma um of chemical engineering in Germany and what I had to do was uh four oral exams within three weeks so I had to study for eight months in the library from six in the morning to seven or eight in the evening and um the grades are very important because they are they they decide um which uh job opportunities I can take afterwards .
Um so the preparation for these exams was very hard especially because they were oral exams , um and therefore .
