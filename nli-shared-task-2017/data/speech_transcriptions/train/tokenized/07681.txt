I miss mostly my sister , my pa - my parents and my friends when I 'm away .
I also my miss my bed and my spec - special objects that I use mostly and which I had to leave home when I go somewhere else .
And I also miss um home because I can uh cook at home and I , I I can have my bath uh in my own bath .
And also uh I can read uh anytime I like .
I can turn the lights on anytime I like and I can watch TV .
Um those are just uh private things that I like most doing when I 'm at home .
So when I , I 'm gone I usually mi - miss all of those .
