I usually read like about news magazines , see what 's going on around , local ones or national ones .
So they will have the idea what 's going on I can co - I can speak to my kids about those issues and discuss any clues they might have .
Also , I like to keep myself informed this way so I would say I 'll be well prepared for any .
Uh anything other than that , I usually read .
I 've been reading these things I was in high school .
