The home is the place where I missed most when I 'm out of my house .
Actually I completed my graduate from UK so I was studying in UK for three years and at that time I missed my home so much .
I missed my family I missed my friends and and I missed everybody when I used to live in UK I used to , to go various places when I was here in my , at my home like I missed everything about my house , the room I live in , the the room where I used to pray and everything .
But the most important person I missed is my uh my mom because I love her so much and it is .
