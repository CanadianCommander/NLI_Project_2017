The thing I most miss when I 'm uh when I 'm away from my home , is that I really miss the people .
My favourite song is that I have life in many many years in the same place , so I have been growing up with these people many guys , many friends , many uncles and everything .
So , being out of my place without these persons makes me feel really sad .
My reason number two is because people make me feel very comfortable people that I know they really make me feel comfortable when I have many problems and then I talk to them and then they can .
