One thing I think someone must posses in a team is team spirit .
They must be able to have team spirit within the team .
They must be able to help each other in the team .
It is just not the one cause he must help the whole team to win .
It is unselfish motive of such having the team spirit that helps people to win as a team .
As it it is very important to win as a team and and not win a single individual .
And examples is in you have a cricket uh cricket it is as much is been played where people with will win .
