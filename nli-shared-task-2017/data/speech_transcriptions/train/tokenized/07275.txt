I prefer reading novel because of what I think is the that novels are really helpful for your vocabulary as well as they improve your English language .
It enhances your control of the language , it helps you know know many things which general other people do .
It is very helpful in many quizzes and all those things .
It also helps to generate and opinion , great novelist bring great opinions along with themselves .
For example the man who sold his Ferrari , that is a novel I love I love the most .
It brings a lot of opinion and it answers my view about life .
It is very helpful .
