When you 're when I 'm away most of all I miss my family .
In the first place because I have a great relationship with every member of my family and um I miss very much uh sharing time with my mom .
Um for example , now I am doing an an exchange program uh wi - with my university in Paris and well , I have the need to call every day to my house and speak with every member of my family .
My dad , my two brother and my mother .
Therefore I can I can be < % > .
