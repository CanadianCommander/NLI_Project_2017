When I 'm away not at home , I mainly miss my family .
I 've got a sister and a brother and my sister is my twin sister so I miss him um very much when I 'm not with her .
I also miss friends that lived near my home and when I 'm away I ca n't see them a lot .
And we have a nice garden .
I I really like to just relax in the garden and to um sit outside and just look at what 's and yeah have a nice time .
