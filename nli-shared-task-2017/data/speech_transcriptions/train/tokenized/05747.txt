I read a few books in my time but one that I will speak about is the The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy .
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy is a book written by Douglas Adams and it is basically a philosophy of all things in the world conveyed in satire , lampoon if you may .
The reason why I like the book so much is I really Identify with one character .
The character is Marvin , he is a paranoid android .
He basically is depressed all the time but he is fantastically intelligent .
Besides this all other characters and everything about the book is something that I love .
Thank you .
