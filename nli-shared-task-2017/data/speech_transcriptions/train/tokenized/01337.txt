Um if I could have a job what I wanted um I would choose uh English author for this two reasons .
First of all I would like to be an English author because I could influence pe - people .
For example um um si - um the book Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Ann Brashares .
Um it influenced me in like um treating my friend in a fair way we - after I read this book .
Um so I would like to write and influence others like this book influenced me .
And second um I would like to be an author because I like writing in English .
Um if I have some ability and hobby in that area , I believe that I could succeed .
