I think one a big quality uh who makes a person valuable member of a team is honesty .
If your are first of all , because if you 're an honest person uh you are someone who 's always going to tell the truth .
Uh people are going to trust you and they are going to to give you more uh different issues that the you ; re going to be allowed to do more different things if they trust that they they do n't trust you .
So I think uh to be honest in in a group if is a very very important uh quality .
