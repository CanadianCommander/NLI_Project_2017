An interesting book I have recently read is Jane Eyre .
Um this book was interesting because it was about a girl who did not have any emotions at first but then she later went on to tour in a nearby town .
There she fell in love and from then on she began to openly express her true feelings .
What was most interesting about this book other than the character was the ending .
Although it appeared like Jane would not fall in love with her lover , in the end she came back to her lover and lived with him .
The ending was really had an ironic twist and that was what made it interesting .
