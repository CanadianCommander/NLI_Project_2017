If I were to invite any friend of mine to my country , say I would surely then just go to Delhi because firstly is the capital of India .
Secondly , it 's got a lot of huge variety of almost anything and everything .
So we have this place called place in which and which is like one of the biggest open malls for Asians and a really good great place to be in and we have variety of markets which uh you know , give you an example of the diversity , the cultural diversity and the ethnic diversity which Indians so proudly presents to everybody .
Along with that there are a lot of other things to do in Delhi because basically it 's the capital and so it 's pretty happening .
I guess that 's where it should be .
