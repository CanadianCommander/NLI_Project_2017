I would suggest them to visit Medellín , Bogotá , Cartagena and maybe Providencia and I would probably offer to go with them because I think uh somebody from Colombia should show them the cities in order for them to really enjoy and absorb the culture and I mean everything that is to know about Colombia and the different cities .
Um I wouls like them to visit Cartagena because it 's beautiful colonial city uh with a lot of comfort , good food , it would be like a luxury part of the trip .
Uh from Cartagena you can also vo - uh boat and tra - travel to beautiful islands that are near .
