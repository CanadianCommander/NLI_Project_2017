Actually when I 'm away from home I do n't miss it that much .
I mean of course there are things that I ca n't find uh abroad uh for example the food , I mean I 'm quite fond of French food but uh when I 'm away from home I mean when I travel or even and even if I had the opportunity to live in another country , I think I would be very happy to have the opportunity to to meet different people .
Furthermore I like the way to to feel uh I 'm not home anymore and um in as much as I like traveling a lot , uh it 's it 's quite uh a chance for me to to have the opportunity to discover other picture .
