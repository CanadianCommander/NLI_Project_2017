Uh the latest book I read was called The Shadow of the Wind .
Um the book in book in Spanish .
It 's about , a story about this ol - little kid that read book um and then he unveils a mystery with with author of the book .
It 's really interesting because he makes it reality and two stories combi - uh combined together and then really a good mystery book with love stories and drama and a lot of tragedy in the end it 's really good when that guy is killed .
Really good book .
