Uh one of the most interesting books I have recently read it 's uh Jonah Lomu 's autobiography .
Uh Jonah Lomu was a very successful rugby player for New Zealand uh who , who had kidney failure and , and had to move countries here to England , play for a different team and was out for quite a while , for about four five years .
And uh what most impressed me is the way he , he had to overcome this kidney failure when his , he was told he would never be able to play rugby again and known as probably the best player in rugby worldwide he overcame this problem and he 's now playing again .
