Uh I will give preference to first career only no other than the job because this job means that this is just a temporary you just fulfill your your desires at that particular moment but as a career if you studied like uh as an engineer or a dentist or a dental surgeon , the career is most important for any person uh for the future also .
So I prefer my first preference is for the career only .
Um I myself being a dental surgeon my my uh career my as a dentist I 'm dedicated to my career only , to my profession rather than the job .
Job it 's uh just like temporarily when you want to do something at that particular moment you can go for a job but career it will take a lot of time for you to sit .
