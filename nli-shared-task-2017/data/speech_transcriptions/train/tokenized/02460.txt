What I miss most when I 'm abroad is the comfort that we have at home in that it 's always great to have one 's own room for example and to to know where each thing is and we have finally a lot of habits we are used to being here at this time and even it 's great to drop away from everyday .
I think it 's quite good to to apply it .
Uh for example uh to to remain among one 's family for one time .
