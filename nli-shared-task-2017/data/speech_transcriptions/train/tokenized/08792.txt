The special opportunity that was given to me was taking the TOEFL exam .
My mother paid for this exam since I do not earn moneys uh since I am just a student .
I ask my mother to pay for the exam for me , and she agreed with uh my request .
And uh with this opportunity I maybe uh able to prove that my English is enough to apply for some master programs abroad .
Uh that 's the reason why I take this TOEFL exam , and um I like my mother since she gave me this opportunity .
