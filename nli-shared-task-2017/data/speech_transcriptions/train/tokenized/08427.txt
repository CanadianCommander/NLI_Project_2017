I have uh read by Margaret < % > because he is uh it 's stronger and real .
It talks about a father then wrote down a diary um to his daughter that is uh attend to hospital after a terrible accident .
And in this in this diary he write about um a story of himself and he 's the story of uh man .
I uh like very much this book because it um shows of uh how after um behind um a society that uh is perfect we can uh it seems perfect we can find the uh lo - lots of uh paradoxes and uh things that are not real .
