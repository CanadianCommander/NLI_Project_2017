I think the one quality that stands out uh in order to be a valuable member of a team is the team working skills .
In my opinion , if someone has this quality , then he can achieve his dream uh his , uh his career goals .
Secondly , I believe that the outcome is really productive of a team when all the members have these skills .
Additionally , I feel that as the wise saying goes , unity is strength , when we work together as a unit , the result is undoubtedly very great .
I have personally observed while working on an assignment that when I worked with a team , my performance was obviously better when I worked alone .
Thank you .
