If friends from another country , uh they are going to visit me or Germany I would um recommend them to visit Berlin , , Hamburg and Munich .
Berlin for that reason that it gives a good example of the um history of Germany when it was divided into western and east Germany and they can visit um that of formal wall was place and it 's the main capital so they can get to flair then I would recommend because it 's really nice city .
You have uh a good landscape and the old buildings from the baroque .
Hamburg for the reason that it 's um it 's bigger city and Munich because of it 's buildings .
That 's all .
