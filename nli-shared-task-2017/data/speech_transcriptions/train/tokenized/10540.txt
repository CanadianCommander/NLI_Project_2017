Well , it is very hard to find uh free time for me these days because I 'm into my studies but whenever I find free time I generally uh spend my time reading novels .
I like a lot science fiction novels and presently I 'm covering the science fiction novels by Michael Kristen .
Uh he has written Timeline which I have enjoyed a lot up till now .
The next uh novel that I 'm going to read would be The Last Word by the same author .
Uh I would be reading more of science fiction novels as of now but uh I would also like the romance genre of novels too .
