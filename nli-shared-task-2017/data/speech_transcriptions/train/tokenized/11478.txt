According to me if some of my friends um come from another country and they are willing to spend the time in my country I would always suggest them to go Manali , it 's a very beautiful place , it has very good temples , there are beautiful mountains , there is a lot of snow fall and the environment is very pleasant there .
There are many resorts where it 's uh cheaper and they can always go for those resorts and food is inexpensive .
I would suggest them to do Manali since it 's very very inexpensive place and a beautiful place to have their recreation .
