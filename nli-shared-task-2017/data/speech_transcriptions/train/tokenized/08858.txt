Um an accomplishment that required me to work very hard was um my studies of linguistics .
It was my second approach to studies .
I was and um studying when you 're older is quite a big thing because I had to finance myself .
So I had to uh work uh part time and go to university .
So I had to organize my time very well .
Um second problem was that my environment was n't very helpful when I decided um study linguistics , they said well you have a great profession , why do n't work in that ?
So I had to fight um or argue with people all the time .
