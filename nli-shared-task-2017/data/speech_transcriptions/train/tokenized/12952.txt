The most interesting book I have ever read is Chromosome Six .
This book is written by Robin Cook which is one of my favorite writers .
This book is based on a science fiction .
This tells me about what true facts can damage the life .
As I am from a science background I get to know a lot of things which I have not yet heard about and what ritual things are really important in the science .
This book has even given me a lot of knowledge related to the damages which science can cause if it gets into wrong hands .
I 've read this book many times and every time I read this book it leaves an after-effect on my mind and I 'm really inspired by it .
