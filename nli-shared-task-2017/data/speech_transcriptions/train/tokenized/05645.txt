When I 'm , when I 'm away from my home the first , the first thing that I miss , I , that miss me is the atmosphere and because I 'm alone there is no my parents no my brother , so it is a different mentality .
Then there is the um my room because I have my space , I have my , my desk um my bathroom , my bed .
It is very , it is little things that , that change and that need be when I 'm away .
