Um first of all I have to express that I 've been away from home for the last eight years of my life .
I was living in California being a student and working .
As a result uh over that period of time I missed many things about home .
Most certainly the most I missed about home was my parents and friend 's company .
Uh there was n't a single day I wanted to see them and I wanted to be with them so um whenever I get the chance during vacations , I would travel back home and see my parents and my friends .
And about um I also uh miss my mom 's cooking , uh she is a really good cook , uh she knows her Turkish cuisine really well , cooks really healthy .
That was another thing that I missed about home .
