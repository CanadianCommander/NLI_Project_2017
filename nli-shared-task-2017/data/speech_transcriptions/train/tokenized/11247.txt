Well , an interesting book yeah I remember of this book Atlas Shrugged written by Ayn Rand that I , that I read some time back .
This book was interesting as well as motivating .
The author , uh Ayn Rand as you know an ad - advocate of objectivism and has tried to convey her ideas through this book .
The plot is interesting , the characters are , you know , awesome .
Uh she is trying to depict some characters and uh you know , some uh great characteristics through uh characters and has really been portrayed very efficiently and aweso - , it 's awesome .
