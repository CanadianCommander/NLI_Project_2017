I am Libyan and I am medical doctor and uh I have my job as a academic lecturer in Faculty of Libya and I have been offered scholarship to continue my study as a PhD student in Canada here and it is very important for me to have this such great opportunity from my country because it 's from , broaden my knowledge , knowledge and uh give me more experience and prepare me for the medical research later on when I come back to my country .
Uh that 's why I am here in Canada and I hope that I can manage it because it 's , it comes once and it will be the last one for me , last opportunity , that 's why today I have to take the TOEFL as part of requirement for my PhD program .
Thank you .
