In my free time I would like to read novels basically most mostly non fiction novels .
The non fiction novels helps me in improving my English .
It also helps in relieving stress after work .
The non fiction novels basically uh teaches us about various topics such as management topics .
I used to read non fiction novels , I have read many none fiction novels such as You Can Win by Shiv Khera .
This helps me , this helps me preaching how how better to uh think differently like uh the winner do n't do things different things but they do things differently .
