If I could have any job area I wanted , I would like to be a writer meaning freelance writer from home , being able to live with my family witting novels , writing for magazines .
Um I would like to have a family and I would like to work from home to care for the kids .
And um do the housework and stuff like that , have a little study where I can write uh on a typewriter or a computer .
Um also a nice library would be of advantage for that and it 's just something I really want to do uh I like to do .
Um freelancing , working from home that 's my ideal set up I think .
