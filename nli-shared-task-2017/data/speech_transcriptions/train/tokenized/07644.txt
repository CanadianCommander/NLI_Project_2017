If my friend from another country was visiting me in Canada , I would uh suggest her to uh visit Toronto .
It is because Toronto has Niagara , CN Tower and other places that you can visit are really famous in other countries as well .
Those places represent Canada and it is Toronto is such a big city of Ontario and it is a good place to have fun .
I 'm sure that she can have fun in Niagara CN Tower and other places in Toronto .
So I would definitely bring her to Toronto for her visit .
