The best paradigm is my family and home town is that , I went to the New Zealand three month for the two reasons .
First , I missed my family so much because , that is my first time when far from my family alone .
The second of all , I miss my in Ko - Korea transportation so much because transportation system is very good and Seoul but in new Zealand , it has a poor transportation system and then I did n't have uh any car , so I was so uncomfortable .
