First of all I have to say that I would advice more than one place to visit .
I would advice to visit three big cities .
First of all is to come in October .
I would send some to Munich to the October fest because it 's typical German uh party and time and it 's very interesting .
The second city I would send him to is Hamburg .
I think Hamburg is a nicest city in Germany and also the Aquinas .
And for instance I also would advice him to visit Berlin because it 's very important for the German history and you can see the history .
