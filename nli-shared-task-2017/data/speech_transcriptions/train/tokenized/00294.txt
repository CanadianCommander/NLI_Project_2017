Uh the most interesting book I 've ever read was which is written by < % 6.8 > .
Uh the title means the explorer , uh explorer of the after death worlds .
The people make uh a travel package to the , to the death in the future and then people do n't come back because the paradise after death is too good to come back .
But this book actually made me think the death uh seriously related to my Christianity so it was so memorable and uh worthwhile .
