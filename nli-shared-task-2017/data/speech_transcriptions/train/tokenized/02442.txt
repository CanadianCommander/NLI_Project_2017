I most prefer to read magazines because uh it covers topics that I may be interested in .
A wide of range of topics can be covered in magazines such as cars or mobile phones or different types of electronics .
And I believe that magazines are um not as a strong way of increasing your um increasing the type reading you have because reading a novel for instance will open up your mind .
Novels um such as The Man With The Iron Mask or The Count of Monte Cristo will uh get you uh better vocabulary and that I think is more important .
