Uh I think the ability of cooperation is the most important uh quality that one member of team should have .
First uh , if you 're in a team you , it means you need to work , but your members or other peoples .
That means you need to help each other and cover it with each other .
So , so the ability of cooperation becomes more important uh in a team .
And that 's kind of how the team works and so I think it 's most important thing .
