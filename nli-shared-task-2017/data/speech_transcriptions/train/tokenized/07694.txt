When I am away there are several things about I miss from my home .
There is my house and the comfort that it brings along , and , and , and your bedroom and you 're accustomed to your bed and your method of sleeping .
And when you 're away you have to adjust to a new surrounding environment , and your method of sleeping , and the comfort which you have developed living in your house will have to be re-adjusted .
Furthermore , um when you 're away from your house you have to adapt to living independently , and you know it 's with the people you 're not used to be with .
You 'll have to adapt to other people 's cultures and their customs , and what they expect from you as a person .
Uh finally when you 're away from home you might be faced with a culture shock .
