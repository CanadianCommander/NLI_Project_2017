Well I prefer novels mostly at bedtime then I fall asleep easily and I like novels because they contain a lot of different information and they carry you away into different worlds and uh take take you with them and you can see the characters and different plots evolve around you and it 's mostly the sort of taking you with them that I like most about them .
