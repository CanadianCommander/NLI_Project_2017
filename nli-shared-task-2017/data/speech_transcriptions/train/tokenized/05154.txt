In my free time I be reading uh novels which are related to non-fiction .
Um some of the novels I read are about Indian philosophies philosophies written by Indian authors .
I also like reading fiction books which are like Sherlock Holmes or written by Paulo Coelho like The Alchemist .
I believe all these novels improve my understanding of human nature as well as uh many other aspects of humanity .
I also like magazines which are more into realistic world and improve my understanding .
