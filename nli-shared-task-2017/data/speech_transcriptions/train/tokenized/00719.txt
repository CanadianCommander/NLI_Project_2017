I suggest them to go to Tokyo and Hiroshima .
So a reason why it 's going to be uh first of all , Tokyo is a big city in Japan and Tokyo has a lot of place places they can visit it .
Also in Hiroshima is uh world heritage is over there .
One of them is uh Peace Memorial Park , the other one is Museum Shrine .
Both of them are really great place to go there .
For Tokyo if they went to Tokyo at least they need two to three weeks to stay there because they have a lot of place that I want them to take it .
Of course one of the place is going to be at Tokyo Disneyland and at Tokyo Dis - .
