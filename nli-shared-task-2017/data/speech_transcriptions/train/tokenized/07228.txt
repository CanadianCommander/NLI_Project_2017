Well just a few weeks ago I was given a great opportunity , the opportunity was you attend the master in .
And this would allow me to move to London in the second semester .
And this would mean to enter a new style lives to get in touch with new cultures , and to get in touch with different peoples .
And it will improve my ability to cope with other cultures , and to cope with problems .
To deal with uh every day life problems .
I am not used to deal with in .
I think then I will move to , to London in the second semester , in order to do this .
