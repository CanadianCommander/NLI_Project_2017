I would like to read about different uh autobiographies of different great personalities like uh Stephen Gerard , Rahul Zaveri .
I most read autographs of those person who are successful in life so that by that I can know the commitment , the hard work which they put into the game um by this by this I can uh learn more about life responsibilities uh your responsibilities in life , the hard work and commitment and you have to have the zeal to really work in whatever you do so the importance is very high so it is very uh important to finish .
