When I was in high school I had a chance to make a speech about my country .
That was in France and uh the students were really happy to have me because I was the only student from Africa and I had a chance to explain where the country is located , how many people live live there , what are customs and what everyday high school student do .
And it was really interesting because uh none of my classmate knew about uh my country and as , asked me a lot of interesting questions about like the food we eat , what kind of animals live there , and I really enjoyed my presentation .
