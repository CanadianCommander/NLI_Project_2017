I like a book about Steve Jobs who is the CEO of Apple .
He uh was born very poor family but become of the richest man in the world .
What I , why I him is that uh he always pretend , present vision uh to young people .
Uh , he always say do n't stay always , you stay , stay free , stay hungry .
It means we have to have our vision to the future .
So I always think about him .
