If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country then the place I would suggest them to visit is New Delhi .
The reason being that New Delhi is the capital of the country and truly represents what India is all about .
It is mixed of modern and historic uh things .
Uh apart from the historical buildings it has it also uh has a touch of modern buildings and everything of that sort that is coming up in , in , in the near future .
And it actually displays the kind of uh development and the growth that India that is happening in India at this point of time .
So I would suggest that New Delhi is the place .
