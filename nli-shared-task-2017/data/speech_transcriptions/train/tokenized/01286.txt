I think it 's good to read magazine to spend my free times .
First of all magazines have uh several short articles , unless you do n't have enough time to finish the whole book you can only finish read the article and then you can go on rest of them when you have any other extra times .
Secondly you can have information that 's not a fiction , most of the magazines have non-fiction stories for the articles which is written by .
