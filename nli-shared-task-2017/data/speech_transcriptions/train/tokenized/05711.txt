This summer I went to South Korea and I did an internship at the Hotel .
I went there all day , every day , until Friday and I worked three hours a day or maybe six hours a day yeah .
And I worked , what I did was I researched different hotels and collected the data about other hotels ' summer packages and we tried to make our package better than any other hotels so we could make better packages .
