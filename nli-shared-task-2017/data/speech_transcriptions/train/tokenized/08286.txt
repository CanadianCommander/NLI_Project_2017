An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was the national level entrance examination that was conducted when I was in my first job .
It was very difficult task for me because it needed consistent hard work and a to attend and also to score good in the test .
I wanted to top in the test and this accomplishment would bring proud to my family and I would be the first person to come in the top fifty of any level , any national level entrance examination that had been conducted in my country .
