These people would come to visit France , I would suggest they not only visit Paris as it is a capital City , it 's important to see it .
I will suggest that they see also the countryside .
And uh it presents a variety of landscapes and places such as uh for instance , also very different places and are also very characteristic of what France is .
Uh the countryside has been very important uh in French history .
And it 's and in French society but uh I would n't of course forget Paris as it has many , many things to see .
