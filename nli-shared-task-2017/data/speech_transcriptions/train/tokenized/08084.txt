When I am away of my home , I really miss my parents because they are the only ones who can take away my sadness and fill my heart with gladness .
They inspire me all the way to be a fruitful and productive man as well as they they do not save any effort to advise me and to push me towards the best to be uh a very good man in the future , besides they provide a friendly and quiet and suitable atmosphere at home to be a good man to be uh very productive .
