I 've been away from my home last year more than USA for a year and what I miss the most was my way of life like going to bars , seeing my friends and I do n't know , do stuff with my real friends that I know for a time and one of the stuff that miss the most was my turn tables because like it 's my stuff .
I 'm a DJ and like listening music and stuff like that just make me happy and all those kind of stuff I could n't there so I missed it a lot .
And what I miss the most too was my family because I I could n't talk to them , I could n't see them for important days like chri - as Christmas , as anniversary and stuff like that .
So is what I miss the most .
