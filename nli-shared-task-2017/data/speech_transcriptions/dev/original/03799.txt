After I finished my military service I get the chance to make uh, to take part in the camp America, so I went to USA to work in uh U.S camp, it was located in Minnesota near <%14.5>. And in this camp I got the chance to improve my English, to learn new things and to find new people, to meet new people. And so it was really important for me because I improved my English very well. So I have chance I had the chance to do a lot of things there also for example to having a track or have fun with the kids out there because I like to help these kids.
