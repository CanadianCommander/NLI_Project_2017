Miss most about my uh, uh home when, when I am away uh my family and my sisters because I'm very close to my sisters. They are my best friends, and it's uh very difficult for me to uh be away from them for a long time. Uh another thing I, I will miss is my mother's cooking. Well uh like uh traditional dishes from my country uh mostly because um, uh probably where would I go is ve- uh there is uh dishes are very different there, and uh I'm not familiar to it. And well food is a very basic thing in a daily life, right?
