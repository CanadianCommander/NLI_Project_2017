In my country, in Mexico, the most efficient type of transportation would be buses, both within the cities and towards foreign cities. Buses are very efficient. There is there are many lines of transportation and many companies invest in buses and they are the safest and more and more reliable ways to transport around the country. Uh within cities, especially Big Metropolis there's also the subway system which I find very good um and also many other users find it good but it's restricted to big populated big and populated cities so it's not too reliable. So probably the best way would be by bus.
