The opportunity that was given to me was the opportunity the chance to learn Chinese in foreign school. Um Chinese as China is, is one of the most developing country in the world, uh Chinese is  getting, getting more important so there are practically more chance to get uh special jobs like when I went to law firm for Intern um a lawyer said that a lawyer also can speak Chinese is practically preferred and I can travel China. The second reason is that I can travel china and have more Chinese friends which makes me a lot of different experience.
