I will suggest my friend to visit Hangzhou. It's a very big and developed city in China. And is a very good example of the fiast that developing China. Also in Hangzhou there are very beautiful views and many awesome uh very traditional Chinese. Like some uh big mountains with trees growing and uh the lakes and also many literature the Asian stories that are uh <%35.0> Chinese traditions. And also the food there is fabulous, I'm sure my friend will love.
