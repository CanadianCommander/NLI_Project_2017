What I do miss the most, when I'm um away from home is um my friends because I have a um, um lot of friends and um both place where I study at and uh drinking out, uh going out drinking coffees and um everything. Um it's not about sports um I am ,I do rowing on the rain like river in Germany here, and bond and I um also love my room because I feel very comfortable there. And um all this would um just uh skip away, new places, offering new choices new people and this can be very cruel too.
