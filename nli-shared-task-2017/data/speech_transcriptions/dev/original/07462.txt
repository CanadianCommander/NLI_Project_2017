Well I miss a lot of things about my home when I'm away. I can give a lot of examples um first of all when you are away you feel alone and I, I think the most uh difficult thing to, to, to, to undertake. So what can what can be the things that I miss most about my home when I'm away? First of all my family I think that family is good support for all what you do and so you have no evidence, you have no clues of what you are doing is accurately or right. And friends is also big thing, good stuff to, to be talked about because friends are very supporting, so it's very hard.
