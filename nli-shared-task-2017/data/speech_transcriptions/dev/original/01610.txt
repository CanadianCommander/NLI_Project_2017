When I'm home uh away from home I think what um what I miss most is my best friend Andy. First of all because I can only rely on him, and he has is always time to um to talk about certain problems. Addition another thing is his honesty because he is the only person I can really rely on him and talk about several things. And if I'm away from home, I can't just go home to his home and talk to his parents and talk to his parents I just have to do this by call him or to write an email. I think this person have contacted is really important for me and and is the reason. So when I'm at home I just use, just try to spend as much time as possible uh to talk with him together about certain topics. Thanks, that's all.
