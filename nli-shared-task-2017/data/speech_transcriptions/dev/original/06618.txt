The most uh recent book that I have re- uh read is Erich Segal's Doctor. It's so much related to a doctor's life and being in a profession that uh it actually tells you about the no- about the novel. This profession which I belong and as far as I am concerned the novel is explicit and to the point at what a profe- a professional suffers throughout his career. Right from the very first year to the final, to the internship until his post-graduation dates. It's so realistic in it's nature and the writing is so adventurous that a sleeper can go through the book and can find it.
