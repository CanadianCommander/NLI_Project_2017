Um train is the best uh way of transportation in my country because my country has my country Italy. So you don't need airplane to go uh from the South to the North. Um you can go by train in all the little city um uh in all Italy. So you can go from Milan to um <%> or from Rome to um <%>. Uh it's also quickly but it's not really expe- and it's not really expensive. Uh so I think it is best uh way of traveling in my country.
