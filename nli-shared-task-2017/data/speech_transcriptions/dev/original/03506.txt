I think makes someone a valuable member of the team is team spirit, uh each individual who is participating in a team should have uh team spirit as uh it helps him to get along with other team members very well, and this helps the team to achieve success and to be unified in that at the time of the, at the time of their test. And this is a very important quality which is needs to in every each and every individual who perticipates uh in a team, and uh this way they help each other in achieve success otherwise uh if the person ego come in between it becomes a little difficult to work as a team.
