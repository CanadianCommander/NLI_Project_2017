I have been working for con- as a conference assistant at the <%6.9> and we've had a customer which was very um demanding so that I had to fulfill all her request on time. And every single time she, she called me on the radio, I had to jump into action and get something done for her which was quite hard um to fulfill. And it was very important for me because I um, I'm a good conference assistant over and wanted to prove it to my boss as well.
