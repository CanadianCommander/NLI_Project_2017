According to me I think the knowledge and the team spirit are the main qualities for a member to be a valuable member of of a team. Knowledge because if a person is a valuable member it should have knowledge, if he doesn't have knowledge he wouldn't be able to convey the messages to his team members. Secondly, the team spirit, it, the member should have team spirit, whenever there is conflict between the group members any of the team members the uh member should be able to find, find out the faults and immediately convey the messages to the group members and solve the conflicts between the persons or group members.
