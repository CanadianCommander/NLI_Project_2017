That I can live in another country uh and I think is very imp- important because first live in a different country and study is a dream ever since I was a little children. First I can live another kind of life and practice my communication with people. Second, I can enjoy myself uh another country you can, you can see new customers, new kind of fruit, new culture, even new structures. And um so that opportunity is important because it could improve myself for the future, and uh as the competition is hard.
