In my free time, I like to read um materials about uh scientific topics that are not cover it in school, because I really need to read a lot of um science books for my studies and for um educational studies, but I also I'm really interested in um topics about um animals and psychology about animals. So I tend to read them more than novels or magazines or even poetry. Um usually I read books that um that like um, the school advisor tells me to read outside psychology tells me to read.
