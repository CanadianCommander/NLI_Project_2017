Okay, when I'm away from home the three things that I miss the most which are food, forest and family. So food this is the delicious food that my mum um cooks. She taught me some cooking but still I never make the way that she is getting the delicious dishes. The second is the German forest with most beautiful in spring and I also love it in all the other times of the years. I just love to wonder around there and um after smell of the forest and hear the um leaves when I walk through them. The third one is the family that I really most when I'm away from home. There is just no place and friends never can um be a good replacement for family.
