After my twelfth I wanted to get into very good institute. I actually I wanted to get into BITS Pilani which is one of the best colleges in India. So I work really hard in the last three or four months <%15.6> I had to work very hard I had to study like eight hours a day and, and it was a lot, it was a lot. But and finally, finally when I got my <%29.1> schools which was about ninety two percent. And I could just leap into the admission criteria and actually I was very happy with my accomplishment. I do, I consider it is one of my good, good achievements.
