One quality which a member of a team would, I would like to have is uh, that they should be hard-working and committed towards the team and a positive attitude towards work always helps. Uh another important thing is that he, he should be a team man. Being a team man inspires others and they make the team to work harder and it encourages members to work towards getting success. And a team member needs to be committed towards work and remain positive and to maintain friendly relationships with uh other members of the team. Dedication and hard-work are always important.
