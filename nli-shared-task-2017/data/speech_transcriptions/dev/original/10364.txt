A very important accomplishment to me was preparing the TOEFL exam. It was important to me because next year I'd like to enter university in Tokyo Japan. And in order to enter this university, uh it's required that I get at least a six hundred punctuation in the TOEFL exam. For this reason, all this uh, last month, I've been preparing this exam very constantly everyday. I've been practicing all the different sections that it includes, uh comprising the region section, reading section, listening section and speaking.
