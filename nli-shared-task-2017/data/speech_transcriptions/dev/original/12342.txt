Uh I would just my friend to visit our capital city Riyadh because it has a lot of ancient buildings, historical places. He can  visit it antiques and he can know how it was in Saudi Arabia maybe one hundred or two hundred years ago. Rather than, rather that he can see all the development happening in Saudi Arabia such as the new streets and new sky ca-and the new sky scrapers, the new buildings. So he can see everything about Saudi Arabia history and developments in Riyadh, it also has a nice airport.
