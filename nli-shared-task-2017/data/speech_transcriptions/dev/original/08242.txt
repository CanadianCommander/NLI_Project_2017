Well, if one of my friend is come to visit my country, um I will suggest to him or her to come to Taipei. Because um Taipei is a very beautiful city. And there is some places I would suggest them to visit. Um the first place is my university, NTNU. Because I think my university is very beautiful. And the second place is Taipei101 because it is one of the um tallest building in the world. And he can go um take the elevator upstairs and enjoy the scenery. And the um finally the last place I would introduce him to go to um is a lot of night markets in Taiwan because there is a lot traditional dishes and they are really wonderful.
