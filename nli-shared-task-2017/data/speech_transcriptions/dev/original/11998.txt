According to me, road transportation in my country is the most efficient type. That is because of the smaller cities and the more population in those cities. There is not enough space for the government to think of creating airports and air jams for smaller cities and and also not visible. Road transportation being the major form of communication and transportation helps people to communicate to smaller villages and towns nearby through buses, cars or any other mass transportation. Thus I support that road transportation is the most efficient type in my country.
