Accomplishment which required me to work very hard was to study really hard when I was in the tenth standard in my school. Uh I was really keen on scoring a good rank in my school and I worked really hard towards it. And I studied day and night and I put in maximum effort as I could, and the fruit of this is that as I came first in my school. And this was important to me because I knew it was important to have a good result in the tenth standard, so that I could build a good career later on and also it would make my future bright. So I studied really hard and uh made sure I had a decent ranking in my school. Although the spot, the fact that I stood first in my school was kind of a surprise for me.
