Having good sense of humor helps any team to work lightens their workload and if it's a sport makes it fun to practice and to go to games, that is why I always look uh um to have a good time on teams I go normally if it's work or sports. And um I try to look for those groups and teams that have good humor or somebody in that group that has got a great sense of humor, so I can enjoy my time with these group of people and this team. So that would be my answer, thank you.
