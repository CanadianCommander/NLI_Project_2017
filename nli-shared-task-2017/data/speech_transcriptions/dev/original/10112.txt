In my opinion uh loyalty is uh the most important quality of a person uh which uh will make him valuable in a team. Because uh without loyalty you cannot rely on this person and uh the uh most thing in a team is that the uh team members can rely on each other. So um because they have uh probably the same goals and uh they're loyal and uh working for the same goal the they will reach it. But if you have member uh who is not loyal then you have a problem.
