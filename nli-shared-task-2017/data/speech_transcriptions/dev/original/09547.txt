One of the most special opportunity that was given to me uh was uh to go to abroad uh to study project management, uh in international university uh which is located in Vancouver uh Canada. Uh I believe that I gained knowledge about project management there and in this way I could get a chance to get PMP means project management professional certificate given by project management institute. I believe that I use this opportunity very appropriately and I got this certificate.
