during my free time I like to read a magazine which is called the National Geography which was mainly about the different geography situation in the worlds and uh in different types of world, at a different kind of climate such as the Mediterranean climate which is the major uh climate in Australian and uh the public transportation  system in the world in a different part of <%> and uh uh uh another interesting is about the cultured geography in the world such as some uh traditional culture in different countries like the Chinese new year, as well as uh different habits in the world population. So I think it's the best of choice for uh reading and during the free time.
