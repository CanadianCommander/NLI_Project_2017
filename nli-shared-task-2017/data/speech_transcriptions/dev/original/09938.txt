First thing I miss most about home will be my parents. When I stay away from them I constantly think about them and I feel that I am very far away from people who concern, who are very much confir- concerned about me. The next thing is type of environ- environment in my home, the kind of independence I have with my parents and kind of independence for wha- uh whatever thing I like to do. The next thing will be meals cooking uh which is unique and also my childhood friends and whom I live with at home and my neighbors. On a whole, it's a unique experience.
