I enjoy reading novels and magazines especially novels, I read a lot of books. Uh I read books because it he- it helps improve my reading skills and my my writing skills as well. Uh books help me imagine different things. It expands my way of thinking, my imagination and it's like what they say that reading a book is a lot better than watching a movie because when you're reading a book you imagine the things, the way you like them of the way you actually imagine them not from the point of view of somebody else. That's why I like reading novels and magazines.
