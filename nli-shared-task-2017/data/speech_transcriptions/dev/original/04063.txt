Most important special opportunity had in my life was when I was invited to participate in the congress of Roman law in Latin America. It happened or it took place in Mexico City last year, I participated there because I was a professor in the university of Havana and I was a special, special administrative law in the Roman Empire. That was a big important experience for me because I changed my time with many professors who are studying this, the same topic and they helped me and increase my knowledge about this topic in this moment.
