The most thing, most reason why I think the most important thing that I miss from home is that I miss the comfortableness of the home and I also I miss, most importantly I miss the food, friends, parents. Sometimes parents when you live without your parents uh you get homesick with, when, with these combinations and therefore, therefore you miss your comfort uh because you're away from home, you're in a foreign uh a, a place that you don't know, that results in un-comfortableness.
