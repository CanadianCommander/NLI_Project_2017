Well personally I agree that if a per- a friend come to my country I will take him to three places. First is the museum. I think the museum is the most important place to visit. Because it contain so, the country's history and cultural and many many <%22.0>, many stories about their, their people and their cu- their buildings and or some political events. And the second is the shop, they will, I would, I will take them to go shopping. And the, the last one is some sitting in the house, they can communicate with each, each other.
