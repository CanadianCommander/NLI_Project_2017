I like the book the Da Vinci Code written by Dan Brown because it is an interesting mix of facts and fiction. It has amazing plot and uh which winds up and gives a good <%12.2> of suspense. It written by uh Dan Brown uh who is an author who has written three or four other book. Written same genre. He talks about uh the birth of Christ and His uh blood line in the book. The Da Vinci Code is basically based on the idea of a treasure hunt. And this book is really interesting because it way, it's very nice.
