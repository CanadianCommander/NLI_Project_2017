I like reading novels, uh especially Gothic novels because I think they are very interesting and have, they are have uh very scary effect on you. And I like reading novels from Bram Stoker like the Dracula or Mary Shelley Frankenstein because it has this imagery and uh the style of the authors are very very good I think and I'd like it a lot and in my free time I usually read thirty pages, thank you.
