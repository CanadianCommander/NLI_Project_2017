By getting a job or career I would like it in the National Geographic because I love being with animals. If given a chance I want to know them more. I would dedicate myself for their upliftment because they are coming extinct and by knowing them I can do more for them and uh, you know, if somebody is in danger my inner willing is to protect them. So animals are the most endangered species nowadays so I think if given a job in National Geographic I would have the opportunity to, you know, help them.
