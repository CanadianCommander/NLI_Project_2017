I think the most important qua-, qualities of a members in a teams is cooperation, because if someone cannot cooperate with others, he, he's cannot, it's not make a teams, and like uh teams. We cannot work smoothly if we cannot cooperate with other, we can't help each other and we can do more things and we do it by myself, by ourselves. So, uh we can do more things, more greater things and we can't make ourselves, our teams more stronger than other, than other things. So, I think cooperation is important.
