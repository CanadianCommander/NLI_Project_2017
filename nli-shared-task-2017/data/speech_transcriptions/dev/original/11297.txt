Really enjoy reading novels. Since childhood I've been in the practice of reading my favorite fairy tales, to growing up and progressing towards reading in <%> Jeffery Archer and now the more recent Dan Brown. I also enjoy books in spirituality as well as autobiographical books. I particularly enjoy the book called Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. Fictions still remains my all-time favorite. I can read <%> for days and days. It is a hobby which started out in my childhood and has now become an asset to me in my educational program.
