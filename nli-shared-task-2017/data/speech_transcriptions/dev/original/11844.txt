An accomplishment that required me to work very hard was um immersing myself in community service and taking myself to at Indonesia which was a restricted area at the time. Um I believe that it was a great accomplishment because I was able to overcome my initial fear of helping others and um just going there I realized not only was it physically difficult for m but it was emotionally excruciating children without arms and legs and it was, it was a horrible thing. Um it was important to me in many ways because I realized, it taught me a great lesson first of all, it told me how lucky I was living in  a country and with family and friends that love me and I did not have to go through that pain that they did.
