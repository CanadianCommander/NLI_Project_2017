I believe that altruism is the most important quality that a member of a team should have. Uh, the reason why I'm saying this it's because a team is composed by different  members. It's not just one person and these people have to work together in order to achieve success or victory. And altruism is the way to do this. If someone was selfish, there would be uh at least a little manner, little bit, a little manner of chances that the team will be able to work together and achieve success.
