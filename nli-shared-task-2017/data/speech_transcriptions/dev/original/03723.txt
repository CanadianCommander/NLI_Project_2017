As an interviewer in a survey has, I had the opportunity to become supervisor in the call center. This opportunity was very important to me, because the work hours were much more flexible the salary was much better and also uh this work gave me a good opportunity to develop good work experiences. I had to develop more uh initiatives and become more experienced in assessing others uh others evaluations, so it was an excellent opportunity for me.
