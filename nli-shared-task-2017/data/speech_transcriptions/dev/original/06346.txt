Well I would, I would choose, chose to be a pilot because I lo- love airplanes I like to fly, I Like to travel a lot, so being a pilot gives the opportunity to go to many different cities and to experience the adrenaline of being in, in control of a great machine that is an airplane. I think that is it.
