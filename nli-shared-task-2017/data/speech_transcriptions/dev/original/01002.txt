Materials um I like to read um I like to read mostly poetry by Shakespeare. It has a deep meaning um conveys hidden information that you need to decipher or understand. Um uh there is a lot of work, uh after reading that passage you read to understand what it is about. It's not just and and and you have to research what you read that's why you understand uh you memorize what you read. You you take a message, you keep it with you. Um and Shakespeare is a wonderful writer. I like reading uh his poetry. It's entertaining and uh that's.
