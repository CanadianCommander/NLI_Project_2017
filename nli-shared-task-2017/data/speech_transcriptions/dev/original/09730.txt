The most efficient type of transportation in my country is train transportation. There are many reason reasons behind this.

Another important reason is that they cause really less pollution since now we're using the big trains so we've if more if more of people use that in India then it is very good because there is very less pollution and <%>. Another reason is that it carry a lot of people at one time and they can be less <%> for the moment to <%> time to prepare. So these are the most important reasons.
