I think the quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team is that if she, if she or he is a considerate person uh often, often in a team people need to cooperate with go, need to work together and and if one is too hard, don't think about others, if one person don't think about others, doesn't think about others then the team will not success, so I think considerate person is the more important.
