First uh opportunity was given to me to be admitted to <%7.5> MBA that is why I'm, I'm taking the the TOEFL which need in the admission process. I will, I'm happy to do that because that prepared me to reach my goal. And go abroad in a country where I want to go, and find some friend I last in travels, that will be happy for me to go there and I hope I will be admitted for the <%42.5> MBA.
