Well definitely uh novels I like to read the ancient novels of mythologies or uh ancient Greeks mythology because they are strictly connected by the with um our style of life <%> and this is very very important to understand the um several aspects of uh of a life. And other than the other novels I don't like it very well because I um to abstract it from the reality even if they are surely their message.
