When I'm away from my home I miss the authority I uh, I exact on my family members when I'm around. I miss the pampering which they give me. I miss the con- comfort level which I have with my family members and most importantly I miss the food. I also miss the familiarity with uh my friends. I miss my friends very much because I can have them in case of troubles and uh I miss the cultures. Then I travel to some other city and when I'm away from my home.
