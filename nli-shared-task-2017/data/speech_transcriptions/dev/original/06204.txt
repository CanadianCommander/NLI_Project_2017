When I'm away from my home I mostly miss doing sports because my home is near the seaside and I, and I usually go jogging when I'm in, when I'm home so that's the first thing I miss. The second things, I can't sleep well away from my home so that's very important for me because when I can't sleep well then I don't feel very  well at the next day and I can't do my things properly. And the third thing is I miss my dog because the, because when I'm uh away I can't I can't see her and because she's very old I really miss her too much. And the last thing is when I'm away I can't study very well and I can't do my, I can't finish my work.
