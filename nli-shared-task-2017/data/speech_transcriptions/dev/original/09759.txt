I worked for two years at Radio Hamburg it's a German TV station and radio station of course. And um I really worked really hard because I wanted to get an education there. I was working without money so they didn't pay me but it was so important to me. I really wanted to become an editor so I did, I worked like nine hours a we- a day five days a week. And even on weekends sometimes and extra shifts and whatever it was so important to me. Yes so this was I think the hardest time until now that I worked that hard but it was really worth it.
