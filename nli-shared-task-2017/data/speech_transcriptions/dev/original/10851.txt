It was given to me was to learn uh given to me was to handle a particular job profile which was not mine. I was re- required to handle part of this operations which was not a job profile. This helped me is because I learned more about hoe the operations go, I learned more about something which was not related to my job profile but something other than that plus I was also expected to do my own job as well so one other thing I learned is multitasking me I learned to handle my time in such a way that I could do my job so efficiently and still do the second job that is operations so efficiently.
