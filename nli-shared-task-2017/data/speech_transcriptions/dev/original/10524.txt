I think one of the most important qualities that one has to have in a team is motivation, someone has to be motivating enough to keep the team running. Someone who motivates is the engine of the team. When everyone is down and no one is getting anywhere then someone who is motivative can help the team and bring them forward. For example when uh we were doing a college project we weren't getting any ideas and one of our friends kept pushing us and eventually we came to a decision on a topic and we did the project very well.
