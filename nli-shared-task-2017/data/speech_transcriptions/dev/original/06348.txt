Well as I live in Paris for my studies um I, I also miss um the city where, where I grew. What I mean I grew in the South of France and it's not like Paris. Um well there, there is not so much concrete around us they are all more in, there is more in nature well what I miss a lot is natural and breathing uh true air. Where as in Paris the air is polluted and well is not as pleasant what I miss too is the use of the car because in Paris I take uh trains whereas I like driving.
