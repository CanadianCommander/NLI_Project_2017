Flexibility is the important quality uh for a member of a group, because uh it, it is ve-, very helpful to uh, to make a decision. Uh if uh, if you have a group with uh, with uh many inflexible person, uh everyone will stay in his position that are sometime opposite and uh it maybe very long to uh, to be able to decide something and to uh and then to do something. Uh and, I think if you are a flexible per- person, they can adjust their position and then it's easier.
