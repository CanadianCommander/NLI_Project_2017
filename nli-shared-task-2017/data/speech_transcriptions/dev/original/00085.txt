Actually I like to read magazines and poetry. Um poetries I like so much because my favorite um my favorite poetries are written by um Shakespeare and I like this um this um language he wrote with and um his pronunciation. Actually my most time I spend with reading magazines because uh they are much shorter to read and the information is quite less and for um my free time it's um, it makes fun.
