Choose a job related to economic development, because uh it is quite empowering and uh I think it's uh also quite fulfilling to work uh especially to work for uh developing world countries. Uh I also I also think that uh women's and children issues in developing countries are uh very important topics to uh work. So if I were asked to choose a career I would choose a career in international development uh specifically in third world countries and regarding women and children issues.
