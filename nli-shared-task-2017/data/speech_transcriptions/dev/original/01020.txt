One of the most important achievement in my life was to win the table tennis tournament at my university. This was important to me because not only was I one of the key players, but also the captain of the team. I learned a lot from this experience. For example firstly, I learned how to work in a team. Secondly it increased the amount of confidence I had in myself, and I love the overall appreciation that I ge- got from my fellow students, the teachers, et cetera. The win was so important to me because, overall it was a very happy experience for us that's all.
