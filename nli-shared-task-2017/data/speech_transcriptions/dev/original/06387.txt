What I miss most about home when I'm not there, well the first answer would be my moms food. My mom simply makes the most amazing food in the world and I got no where near as good as her so I really miss my moms food. I, the second point what I miss would be uh you know having the TV say the bathroom with jacuzzi and all such uh stuff. The third which I miss about being home is being spoiled you know, at home I get what I want I just have to ask for it. And I get all kinds of services  from other family members, staying alone is not something I get. So basically two things I miss moms food uh the television, jacuzzi, the bathrooms and being, being spoiled.
