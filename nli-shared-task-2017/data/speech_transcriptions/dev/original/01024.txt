So I think uh the the best transportation when in Paris it is the the Metro, is definitely the Metro because there are a lot of lines going everywhere in the city and the train are coming pretty often so at least you have minimum, you have to wait I don't like uh four minutes and uh this uh transportation system goes everywhere in the city. Uh and then if it's not Metro there is and other train like suburban train to go uh in the suburbs. There is just one one problem with the Metro is that it stops at night uh while in other international cities you you have it all night.
