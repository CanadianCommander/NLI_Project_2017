One accomplishment that very hard for me in the past was uh last during last uh, last Christmas time. Because I had to, I had to work to pay my, my, my university fees uh. And I in that period I had the exams too, so it was very hard to, to study and to work at the same time. But anyway I couldn't do it because I tried to do it was working very hard and anyway I do it, I could do anything, everything. But anyway it was very, very hard, to do all the things that I had to do.
