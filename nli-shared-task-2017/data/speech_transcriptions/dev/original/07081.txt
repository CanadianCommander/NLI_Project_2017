I could I would choose um singing to promote career. First because um I love singing so much and in my childhood I pretty much sings everyday and more that, and my parents says I'm a talent, and I'm, I believe so. And um, and secondly the reason I want to sing is because um you know the singer can have a good pay, you can see the big stars on the stage. And they also have um decent inc-income so they maybe can help me um a better life and I can also know this how to sing as well.
