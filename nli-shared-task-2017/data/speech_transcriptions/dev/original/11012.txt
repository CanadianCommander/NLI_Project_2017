Because you'll learn, you'll learn a lot of new people you meet not a lot of new people and of course the classes are pretty different, and of course the classes are here in Switzerland. So there more discussions and you have to so more queuing, the class sessions that here in Switzerland. Another point of course is the culture, you, there is new, there is uh another culture you can learn a lot of things, there are different another thing it creates a great opportunity if you have work or.
