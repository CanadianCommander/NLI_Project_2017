What I miss the most, definitely is my mum. Imagine myself you know we travel around about the U.S. where I know I'm alone in the night, I'm staying alone I really miss my mum, her cooking and all. And besides that I have a football field in my house which I like the most because I used to play every now and then I played almost every six o'clock to six, seven o'clock. Where I meet my friends and they are of course one of the best friends that I have, have met. You know from my time to when I was  a kid until now. That's the end I think.
