According to me the uh quality that I realized the most now is giving the seminar on the book I read the Da Vinci Code by D- Dan Brown in my last year engineering in front of my classmates. Uh it was more of uh interact- interactive session regarding the book than lonely talk. Uh, uh the book was very controversial and it was of great interest to my fellow students also. Uh it uh showed my ability to convey what I wanted to uh wanted them to understand, and it also showed um my interest in uh writing and in literature, different types of literature.
