Uh one of the most valuable qualities uh to be part of uh, a group would be in my opinion two, first leadership and teamwork. Uh leadership is important because every team needs a leader, uh, uh someone to follow, someone who will call the shots and without a leader, the team succumbs. Uh teamwork, uh this time the individual team members need to work uh to solve a specific problem or matter they're facing. Uh so these two characteristics are very important to be part of a team.
