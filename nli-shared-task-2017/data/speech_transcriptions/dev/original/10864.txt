A special opportunity was given to me was um getting a job, my first real job. It was as um as a software developer in a sport, small business. I had at that time no special training. I was studying uh natural sciences and uh I was seventeen years old. And that was a very important opportunity. I spent three summers developing software. And then um I went on to uh study computer engineering at university. And uh that, that opportunity um kind of determined how my whole professional life would, would uh unfold.
