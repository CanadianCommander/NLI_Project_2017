A valuable member of a team has to be very talkative as um as value- valuable member he has to share his um opinions and his experience to other members then um the team has a better communication. On the other hand I think a valuable member of a team has to be very helpful, because um sometimes um a team, a team they has a lot of problems and then a team member um they should help each other to overcome the obstacles. So I think talkative and helpful are very important to be a valuable member of a team.
