If friends from other county were going to spend time in my country, I would love to take them to New Delhi, which is capital of India. I spent twenty eight years of my life there and I spent all my childhood there. New Delhi has got several historic importance, it has got several monuments like <%22.7> and I would love to show my friends everything wherever I have spent time right from my childhood to my adult hood. I would love to show them everything right from the beginning. So that is why my country is one of the most beautiful and the city I belong to , I have live in is one of the most beautiful city in the entire world.
