If, if I had some friends over, I would certainly tell them to visit the capital of France, which is Paris. And why would I take them in Paris? Of course I would take them to many places because Paris is the number the first tourist destination in the whole world so I don't think I would have a problem picking up. So I would take them of course to the Eiffel Tower which is the symbol of Paris and France. And to the Louvre which is the most known museum in the whole world. And I would take them to <%39.0> which is the symbol of the, of the French kings.
