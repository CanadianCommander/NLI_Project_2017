I think that a good team worker uh should be skilled in the cooperation. Uh he would be keen on helping his uh co-workers and therefore, I don't think he should be uh too ambitious. Uh, instead, he uh should be able to get uh compromises and match the uh needs of the team before then uh his personal needs. Uh these are the qualities that I think are most important to be uh a member of a team. And I would choose such a person for my team.
