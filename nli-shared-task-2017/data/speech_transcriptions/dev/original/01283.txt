Tell my friends to visit Kashmir. It is a good place uh as rightly said by somebody it's a paradise on earth. It's a beautiful place uh filled with valleys and lakes and waterfalls. It's laden with greenery and uh laden with mountains with snow. The best time to visit Kashmir would be from March to August I suppose would be the place in India to visit. Thank you.
