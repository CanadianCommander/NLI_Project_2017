One special opportunity that was given to us the was a chance to study abroad, it was in, uh it was when I was an undergraduate student of a university, and uh I applied for a position of an exchange student. And uh because I was a student that entered the university as a transfer student as a third year student uh first of all, I was  not, I was told that I would not be given a chance but I asked many, many times and finally given a chance to study abroad as an exchange student. And as a result I was able to uh become an English teacher which was a dream and now I'm, I'm enjoying my life as an English teacher. So that was the greatest opportunity that was given to me.
