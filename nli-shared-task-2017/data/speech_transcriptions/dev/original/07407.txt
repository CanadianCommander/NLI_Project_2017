Well, the most I miss about my home when I live outside is my bedroom. The comfort and the easiness and the cosiness of my bedroom is the most I miss when I live. In addition to that, I would miss the people who I live uh whom I live around. And, the I would say the TV programs that I'm familiar with and usually uh follow.
