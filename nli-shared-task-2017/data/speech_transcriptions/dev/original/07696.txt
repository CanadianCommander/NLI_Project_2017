If I could have any job that I wanted or career I would choose architecture. I would want to be an architect mostly because um I could express my emotions, my artistic talent and that way I can help many people, I can help the society by making better buildings, uh making buildings that, that uh, that have an effect in the society, that uh, that, that responds to the society's needs and it doesn't just go for the uh, for the uh, for the magazines and the uh, and uh.
