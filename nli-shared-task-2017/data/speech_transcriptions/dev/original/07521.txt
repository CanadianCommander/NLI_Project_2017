If I could choose right now my career I would choose computer science because I think it's the first step for accomplishing my lifetime goals. First I want to study computer science in order to be a programmer and will later I will start a company that designs software. So basically my career will be my first step then I will focus on working hard to, to ascend in my job in order to later uh f- for my company I ca- a business that can generate jobs instead of consuming them.
