The most important or valuable uh quality a team member should have I think is is supportiveness. A team member should be uh supportive to help other team member members because team consists of different people and not everyone can achieve uh the goal alone or can do every tasks. So each team member has to support the others, I remember a team work i have a few of my studies when we all achieved the goal together and it was impossible to do that alone because of our supportiveness and unity as a team.
