The most uh thing I miss when uh I'm away, is <%6.2> and uh sometime I miss the always also uh phone. And uh it's uh not a good thing I, I think. Uh the now I'm living with my friends and I can ask them to open the door if I miss the key and so this uh, is a big problem uh nowadays uh before it was a big problem because uh I live uh, I live there without any, anybody.
