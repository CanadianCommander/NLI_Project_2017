I personally uh prefer reading novels because I believe that um novels actually have very varied um stories. They tell varied stories and they um people who are who, the authors of novels come from different places and have therefore different stories to tell. And I feel like this is also the place, this is also the where I'll learn the most because of the variety again of the novel. Also just basically classical, classical literature is to me the most thing um to learn about when I have free, free time because I just believe it's the best thing.
