Well the first one is Japanese food uh because I'm a Japanese in native. Uh I would really love Japanese food like <%8.5> uh I often miss it. And the second, second of with a friends or family. Um because I'm away in foreign country or foreign, my country, I cannot connect, uh contact to them um by phone or Internet only. So, those two, those two points are the biggest problem for me when I was away, when I, when I'm away. And is that all.
