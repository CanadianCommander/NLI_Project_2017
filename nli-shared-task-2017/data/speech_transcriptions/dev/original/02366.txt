My parents gave me the opportunity to go there and I value this opportunity for three reasons; the first one is that, I was nineteen years old and I could go away from home for three months, so I could uh prepare myself for living alone at the university. And the second one is that I could uh learn English I wasn't so good in English and I had the opportunity to learn the language on site and living with the people from Ireland. And the third, third one is that that I could travel there and I could saw a lot of things there.
