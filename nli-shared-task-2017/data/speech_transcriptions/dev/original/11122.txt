The idea one is uh very uh hard accomplishment that I, I had to do and to work very hard to get. The SAT test uh scholastic uh, uh assessment test are the college uh entrance test for United States. It composes verbal section, maths section and the writing section. Well I'm not very good at writing nor the verbal section but I prepare very hard for it. And so I got an eight hundred for my verbal score and <%34.5> seventy for my writing score, which I think was not bad for me. This is very important for my college application.
