The test to become uh lawyer is the what I'm saying is very hard. The reason is that uh in Taiwan the <%15.1> go through lawyer examination is quite low. Is passmark is thirty percent, and the topics we have to prepare is quite extensive. And it require day and days uh studying and you can add the tender book into the test. So the regulation you have to remember is very large in amount. Uh but however for lost <%45.3>.
