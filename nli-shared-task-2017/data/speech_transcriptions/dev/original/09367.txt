I just finished reading a book uh this afternoon. Uh this book is uh <%5.6> by author uh <%9.1> and there are several very interesting things about it. Uh the first thing is the idea of uh humanity uh con- con- uh conquering the stars and uh and becoming uh superior uh entity uh namely, uh each human would be part of of uh of something greater with its own conscience uh so a humanity of billions of humans would would have a conscience and would act as one uh one person.
