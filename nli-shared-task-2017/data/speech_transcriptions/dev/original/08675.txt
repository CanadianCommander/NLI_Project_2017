I would say that for my country Germany, the type of transportation most mostly used, the most efficient would definitely be trains. The train network in Germany is very well uh and very sophisticatedly set up. There is trains going from the very north to the very south to the west to the very east. And uh the train connections to those places are fast, efficient and furthermore they get you there in a very small amount of time. Another good aspect of the eff- efficiency of the transportation is amount of energy used. Trains in Germany use a minimum amount of energy while using uh while traveling vast distances.
