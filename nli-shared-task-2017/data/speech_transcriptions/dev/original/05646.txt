The main thing which I miss when I was my uh the parents take care of uh me, the parental culture they have developed in, inside me. I mainly miss the way they look after me, that they care about me and importantly I love my family the most and I would like to be with my family uh most of the time. When I am away I miss my mother's love who I love the most and my parents' guidance in which uh each and every topic that I meet so that I can take, I can make decisions clearly and uh carefully and so that and I know <%30.0> consequences of this will be uh it will be able not to affect my future plans I guess and future plans also. Uh uh and importantly the one thing I like, I love about my family is that my family takes care of uh each and every uh each and every aspect of me very much.
