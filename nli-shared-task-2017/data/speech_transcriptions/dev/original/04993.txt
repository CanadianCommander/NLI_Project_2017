Special, special opportunity that was given to me was the one reception because I was the topper of my village in the school final exam. And that is why the whole village was overwhelmed in joy, uh as I passed and secured the top most position. Um so they gave me a very vast uh uh bouquet of flowers and all managed to party only for my pleasure. And I enjoyed that a lot I will never forget still my day, and that was really unique and exotic to me.
