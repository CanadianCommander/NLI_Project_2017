Uh in school I learn four languages and I think it is very big opportunity to have. Uh I learn, uh I'm, I'm learning French, Spanish, English and my own language is Turkish, So I know four languages. Um I think that to learn a second language is very important thing because uh when you go to, for example Spanish. Wen you go to Spain and you can communicate with others more easily and more relaxedly and you can, you can tell what you want to do to them and it is very important.
