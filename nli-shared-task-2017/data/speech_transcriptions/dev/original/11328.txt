When I'm, when I'm from home, I miss most about my mother and my mothers and fathers interest upon me. And uh in addition I miss the comfort and uh the relaxed situation that I feel when I'm at my home. My mother especially love me and, and she cares about me like no one and she make, she cooks good meals and this meals are perfect and they taste healthy, they taste perfect and I miss all of these.
