The quality that I think makes someone valuable, a valuable member of a team is leadership, because if a person has uh good leadership qualities, he's able to motivate his subordinates. Plus, the person should have the ability and leadership to have, to able to understand the other person clearly to step into their shoes and able to see what problem he is facing. Then only he can help him. Leadership, that's all I can answer for this question.
