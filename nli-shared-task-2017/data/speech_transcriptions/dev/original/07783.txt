When I am away uh I, uh I miss my boyfriend and uh I miss my comfortable beds at home and uh things I have at home and I can't uh take with me. Uh what I, what I uh miss uh ba- uh is my balcony with all the plants on it, I call them my green children and uh yeah, when I'm I, I have fear towards, I really don't know if uh they are okay when I'm back and s- so that's, that's it.
