Opinion is very important uh if you work on a group, in a group together, that somebody uh, ke-, keeps the group together, that they stay focused on a certain topic. So, I think a very valuable quality for a team member is to be able to focus on a certain topic and uh keep all, the whole team on track of this topic. It uh, uh, everyday life it shows that sometimes in teams the-, there, there are just too many different opinions and they're not able to get, to get it on, on point and uh, uh that they cannot prefer, prefer common opinion and to work uh efficiently on this topic. So, I think this is very valuable quality.
