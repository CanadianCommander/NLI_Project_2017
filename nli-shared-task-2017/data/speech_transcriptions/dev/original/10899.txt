If a friends come uh to see me in my country, I would say to him to see uh the Olympic museum in Lausanne. Because I think it's a big, big museum which is really interesting. Um, uh we should go to, to Bern to uh the, the museu- oldest city and uh the, the to do shopping and uh Zurich because it's the biggest uh city in the ci- the, the country and um to walk around lake Geneva because it's a really, really uh beautiful region.
