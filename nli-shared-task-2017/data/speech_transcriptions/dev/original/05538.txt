Uh I had a special opportunity when I was elected as a student president when I was in the sixth grade of the elementary school, and my <%10.3> career of course. Well um first, the reason why it was uh a special opportunity was that it could be used, used to the university as demonstrating a persons leadership a person is a proper leader of a certain company. And also uh for my time um during the president work of the students I could train my ability as a leader.
