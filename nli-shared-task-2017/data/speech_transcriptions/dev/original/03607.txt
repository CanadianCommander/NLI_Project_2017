Was study in Puerto Rico. This was really important to me because I'm a veterinary medicine student and the <%6.3> will be with non primate human, you can call them too monkeys if you prefer. This is really important for me because I want to study in this field of veterinary medicine and to go in Puerto Rico would allow me to see different thing, new way of diagnose uh, uh disease and the new environment. This really a practical place because monkey are free on the island and that all these monkey come from a couple of monkey uh who are originating from India. So we all know where they come from and where, whether they are um, uh they're babies so it is really a good opportunity for me to see ethnology of the species.
