Um well I work very hard for the TOEFL, actually because I needed to be um to register at the university of Charlotte, which is in North Carolina. And uh it took me a lot of time to, to um acquire certain skills like reading and listening, speaking as well. And um, um it was a good experience because um it improved some of my, my um reading skills and my listening skills, and um I hope I will be best prepared. And I think that hard work is um well needed for to, to reach this goal, to get a good score at the TOEFL.
