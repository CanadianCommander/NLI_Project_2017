I think subway is the most efficient type of transportation in my country which Korea. First it's the fee is really cheap. It's it it's like thirty cents and when you take, when I take ride subway it is connected to almost every place in Seoul in Korea. I've I've rode subways several times and we know it's really comfortable and it's really easy to follow the directions and also it is very easy to find the des- places you want to arrive.
