The quality that thinks someone a val- that makes someone a valuable member of a team is honestness. Because uh a team uh should uh obey to uh particular <%12.1> sentence when they are in team. They should not be changing words uh when they are working in group. So uh a contrary this I feel the uh the last quality that makes someone a valuable member in a group is being honest and uh and not talking at their backs so this is a um quality that makes someone a valuable member in a team. And to that uh honestness should not only team uh each and every individual should have.
