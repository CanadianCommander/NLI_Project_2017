One of the most interesting books I've ever read is called To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. It is a book that won the Pulitzer Prize. That itself gives you an idea about how well written and how well formed the book is. It is abo-, story about a small girl whose father is a lawyer. He advocates for the black people but her friends and her neighbors who are all white are much against him because of his views. The book is basically based on racialism. It explains how racialism existed in American society. It tells the story.
