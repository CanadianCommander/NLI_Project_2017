Uh the interesting book I read is one of Agatha Christie books, uh it's unpopular one. Ten niggers, I, I don't remember the exact name engl- in English. But the book was interesting to because it was about all crimes and murders. And you uh especially I was uh very curious about who was the killer. And I always um, I continue sli- try to predict who was the killer. And it was so interesting that at the end you could um realize the actual killer, who was he.
