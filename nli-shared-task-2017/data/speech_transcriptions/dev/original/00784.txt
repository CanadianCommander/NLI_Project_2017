As far as I am concerned I think that career is very much important for <%4.2> because a career is a very important work. As far as job is concerned anyhow it is coming to you at the end of your career so I think that uh career is very much important. But uh as far as me, from my childhood I used to study in uh <%18.0> school which is very much prestigious in the city and I got a good grade in my tenth class and I'm doing a nice career. I am also studying for the masters in com- computer science in US so I think that after getting a nice career then you could get a good job so according to my view I think that career is important than job and I feel that the job uh career is better.
