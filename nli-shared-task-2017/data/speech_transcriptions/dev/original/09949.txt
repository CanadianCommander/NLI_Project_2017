When I'm away from my house I miss the environment in which I live in, my family I miss. And uh especially the food because of ever if we are going to uh, uh different country you don't get the same quality of, the same, same type of food wherever you go. You miss you family because you cannot share whatever your your feelings with anyone else, as well as, as much as you can share with your family. The envi- environment is completely different and you miss your. That's it.
