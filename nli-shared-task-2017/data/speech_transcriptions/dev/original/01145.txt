Uh I think that it is important uh that uh everybody in a team uh has uh the spirit of team for instance uh in uh in the rock uh someone has to share information and to communicate with the other member of the team to improve uh the productivity uh of uh everybody's work. And that's the same thing in sport I think in team. If you have team spirit you will play together and uh individual actions are not best way to win. So team spirit is important.
