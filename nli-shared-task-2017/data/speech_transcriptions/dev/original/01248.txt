The accomplishment that I require to work hard was my pre-graduation course that is called the intermediate course. And I had to work hard because I had to write an exam called EMCAT which would decide about the field that I was going to opt for my career. And I required to prepare for different timetable for my inter- intermediate course and my EMCAT course and balance both. Whereas EMCAT uh EMCAT course require uh time management skills. I realized uh my skills of uh answering accurately and uh within the time limit.
