The specific book I like to read is Harry Potter. I know that book actually is for younger people to enjoy but undoubtedly I really like the characters in that book. For example, the the various names of these actors are very interesting. Furthermore, the lectures the students have are very very funny and ultimately the story, or the procedure of the story is nicely presented. From beginning to the end of the book it stays interesting and worthwhile reading.
