More special, it was given to me is a scholarship that I was awarded with for my undergraduate studies as a civil engineer. It was special in a way that it allowed me to attend a very high, high ranked university and not have to repay back. Since my income at the time was basically no because I didn't have any job and my parents couldn't um, couldn't pay for my undergraduate studies. That is why it was really, really important to me, it was special.
