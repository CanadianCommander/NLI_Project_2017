If I have the opportunity to choose one uh thing that uh um, it is, what it was important for me, uh a special opportunity so you know I choose uh the opportunity to work while I still studying. It is hard as you can imagine but yes I have a lot of, an amount of mo- money that I could spend with uh traveling that is my patient and uh um pay my study also. So the opportunity I choose is working while studying.
