I live in Italy and I live in the Venice area and, and the first city that I would suggest uh to visit is of course Venice. Venice is one of the most famous cities in the world, is so particular with the canals and all the life of over the water. And, and then I would suggest to visit of course Rome, capital city because of the traditional, historical tradition of the city. And then I will suggest of course to visit Florence, another wonderful city and very famous in the world. But of course there are a lot places in Italy you can visit and you can be absolutely amazed by.
