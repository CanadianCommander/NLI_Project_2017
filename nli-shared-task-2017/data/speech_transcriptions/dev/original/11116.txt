While uh, while I'm away the uh the thing that I miss most about my home is uh of course my uh mother. My uh brother, the family ties so we have uh that common uh jokes we uh share uh with each other. This is because uh the, the whole family members they are so close to you and when you are away from your uh home you feel that uh you are uh in different world, you are with strangers. So the family members I miss uh most when I'm away from home because uh they uh we share a common tie of bond that we don't share with or we cant share with friends or other outside people. Uh so I miss my family ties.
