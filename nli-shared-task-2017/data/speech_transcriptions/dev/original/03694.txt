The accomplishment like why I need to work very hard for was my graduation from university. I graduated with a bachelor of commerce degree, and actually I got a double major in finance and information systems. This is the accomplishment. And why, why it is important to me is because it gave me the edge in a very competitive market that required the person to be very knowledgeable and has the required skills to advance and a difference in society and actually do the things that you want in terms of uh advancing the knowledge, the career and the money.
