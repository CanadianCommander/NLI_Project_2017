Uh well one of the main accomplishment I have had in my life was my first project as a consultant. I had to implement a tool uh which I was not familiar with which other consultants had failed to, to implement. So I really had to study pretty hard what the tool was about and can get into details now. And then I had to plan pretty clearly what steps had to done to implement it successfully. Uh well I did all these and then I performed work and I worked very, very hard for several months. And finally accomplish that very, very good work.
