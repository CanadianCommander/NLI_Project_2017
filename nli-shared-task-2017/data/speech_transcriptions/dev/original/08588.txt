I would say they should visit Berlin because uh that's the city I live in and I know pretty well so I could show them to friends uh I could show it to friends. And Berlin is just our capital and one has to see the capital and also I like pretty much the uh museums also which is a place with lots of museums on an isle just in the center of the city. Uh especially I like the Pergamon museum with the sculptures and buildings from ancient towns, And additionally there are lots of clubs and pubs that I known and uh of course I'm the perfect guide for the place so that's a place my friends really have to visit.
