If I have the chance to choose the job I want I will probably go with human resourcing, uh specifically in the staffing function. Well, that's basically because I have an internship experience in Microsoft as a station intern. During this process I thought I could, I was able to apply what I have learned into my daily job and the most exciting about that was that I cold attract and employ the most talented people in IT industry major in CS, uh computer science or software engineering to work in the most powerful and uh advanced company in the world.
