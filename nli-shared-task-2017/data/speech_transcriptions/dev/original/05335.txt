I think uh quality that makes someone valuable a valuable member of a team is responsibility, it is important because then his teammates or team members can count on him uh and they can make sure that he does his job and uh if a person is responsible then uh every, every member of the team can do his job without someone uh following him and they will be able to do the job more uh they will be able to do the job better, and uh perform uh better.
