I would suggest to visit Zürich because um there are so many <%7.2> things in it, you have a big lake where you can um go for a walk, um you have a lot of different shops where you can buy very nice things. um you have a very um large night life with different clubs and restaurants and bars. And in addition you also have a very varied um cultural offering and uh not to forget very nice monuments like churches and palaces.
