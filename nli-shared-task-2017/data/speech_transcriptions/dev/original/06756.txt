I came to Bristol about one year ago to work on a maternity leave. And I wanted to go on and do some formal further training in epidemiology. My target was to apply for a studentship to, also a PHD. But then later I understood the fellowship would actually be a better option for me. This was very ambitious and I had to work very hard towards preparing a formal proposal for my fellowship. Also because the deadline was very tight I worked but I had to bring my supervisor on this.
