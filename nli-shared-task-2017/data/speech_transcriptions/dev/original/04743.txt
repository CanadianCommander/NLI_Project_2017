I think the most uh efficient type of trans- uh transportation in my country is bus um because um bus is cheap and uh it can goes everywhere um in China and China is not very rich countries. So um so most of people in China is not is not very rich. So the the but the um so they only can take bus to go to work or go go somewhere and and uh and uh secondly um the bus can go everywhere because because the uh because because we use bus to to uh go to the countryside or some somewhere. That's why I think bus is the most efficient.
