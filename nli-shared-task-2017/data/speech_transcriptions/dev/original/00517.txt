Job which I will, which I will be able to choose I would definitely choose the area diplomatic job. This would give me the chance to go explore the world as it involve being, it involves being transfered to different places and for a limited period of time. Either three years or four years, and it will give me the opportunity to look around areas. Such when I was in Brussels I was able to look at different countries and visit them and different places. Hence I was able to enjoy also uh add memories of <%33.8> my uh wage. Also uh it gives me some relaxation, it is not only a job is how I will be able to move round new people and different people around the world.
