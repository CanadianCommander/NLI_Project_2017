If friends from another country were going to spend time in my country I definitely would tell them to visit our capital Berlin, because it uh offers a variety of things to do. You can <%12.3> go out to party and shopping. But in contrast to that I would tell them to visit Munich because it is such a different city in the same country. It <%23.0> very traditional, there are a lot of things you can do like going to the October Fest which is just only in October but it's all the other month. And uh in addition to that I would tell them to visit Heidelberg because it is such a famous city and it is all beautiful with old architecture and houses. It is quite a nice place to visit.
