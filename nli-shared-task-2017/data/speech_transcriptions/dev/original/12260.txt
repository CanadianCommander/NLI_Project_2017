Uh one of my accomplishment that required a lot of work and it was very hard for me to uh, to uh, to go through the, the, the whole thing is uh I work in a Law firm. And we have this kind of report that we should have sent like two days ago but it was, we were really late and we were short in time. So I had to stay in the office like for twelve hours a day just to renew and try to figure out the the mistakes that we have done. And to put up the right articles and to make the right choices concerning the structure of the, of the report and it was important to me because it was my first task.
