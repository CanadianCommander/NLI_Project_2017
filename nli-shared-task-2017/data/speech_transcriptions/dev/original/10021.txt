I think the most effective type of transportation in Canada is the subway. Um the subway is very convenient because first, you could go everywhere within the subway. Almost all the places in Toronto are linked with a subway station. Therefore if you wanna go to a certain place you could just hop on the subway and it will carry you there. Also it is near my school and therefore if I wanna go to certain places, it would be really easy for me to reach to go to the subway. Moreover the subway station in in Toronto is are linked with other transportations for example bus, street car etcetera. Moreover in order to save more time.
