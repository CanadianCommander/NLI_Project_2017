Two years ago I went to America for uh study in high school program. And my teacher put me into the AP History uh class, which AP class is really hard for me to handle. And I don't understand the content. Uh three month later I spend, every, everyday I spend uh at least three hours to read the context. And finally I uh passed the AP test uh in May. And I hope that will help me to the college app- application.
