The most efficient type of transportation in my country is the train, the railway um because there is a um a prepared um infrastructure though you can reach um uh large cities as well as as the smaller towns uh in the countryside. Um and it is um available to all persons and other than um the car for example um where you have to be over eighteen years old and um you may not be um disabled and one more advantage of the train is that there is, there is no traffic jam like it is often on the motorways in Germany.
