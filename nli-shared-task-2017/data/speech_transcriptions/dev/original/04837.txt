Sincerely speaking I would prefer to be a, a tour guide at first. Uh one reason about that is uh I can travel all around the world and see many different stuff like statue of liberty in America and Eiffel Tower in France. And another point worth mentioning is that I can practice my speaker skills and my interpersonal and community skills. Um you know I like speaking English and learn some French or uh Germany or, uh or Japanese. If I travel around to France or Japan I can practice with native speaker more, more effectively.
