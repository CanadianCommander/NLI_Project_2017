The material I like to read in my free time is novels. Firstly novels can let me to know something about history just like, just like Gone With The Wind. Before I know this novels, I have nothing about American civil war or American history and after reading that, I gain a lot of knowledge and I know a lot about American culture, American American literature and yeah. And secondly, novels has offered us a lot of space for me to imagine. Yeah just um it has a lot of novels that.
