My most significant achievement uh was when I was uh just a university topper, uh in my second year of engineering. And uh this was especially crucial to me because uh I got everybody's a- applause, and nobody from my college had uh, uh had achieved the success. So uh for this I worked very hard and, and I sacrificed my uh sacrifice for being with friends, and spending time uh for other impor- other unimportant things, and I only about uh, uh harder and sincerely. And uh as and everybody looked up to me after this, and uh and uh everybody la- everybody junior in the college wanted to emulate my success. And so it is very important to me and uh that's it.
