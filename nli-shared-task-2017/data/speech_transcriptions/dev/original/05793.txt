I have uh read uh an interesting uh book, it was the Da Vinci Code of uh written by a Dan Brown. Uh it, this book uh was very interesting for me because uh the story was uh really good and uh because uh the book provides a lot of uh historical uh examples. And we can learn a lot about uh the Louvre. We can learn about uh, uh Da, Da Vinci. This is why it was very interesting because it was, it was not an i- it was not only a invented story but based on the real events.
