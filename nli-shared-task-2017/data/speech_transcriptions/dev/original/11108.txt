I would prefer to take my friend to Hagar that is rich in culture. It is situa- it is situated in <%7.7> part of our country. And uh I will, I will like to take him to that place because of our rich culture. There he will be able to see what India is basically is. And to sh- show him the attire of the Indian country. To show him the uh river <%28.6> and I can give you an example also for that. If you want to go to as a mechanical and just technical aspects masters you go to Germany. Similarly for doing <%38.6> you prefer to come into India and then in India you prefer to come to Hagar, That's why I would take him to that.
