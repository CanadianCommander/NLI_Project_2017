I think I will say like if can miss something family, is whole of my family ill be missing. First of all my special food prepared by mom is very delicious, I don't, I don't find it anymore else not on restaurants in anyway. Even spending time with them make me relax. So the kind, the kind of love I'm getting from them I don't get it anywhere. So I think it's some of the thing that I cant get anymore or anyway. Love , kindness and support from my family members is somethings which I would like to have. And even my dad explanation for solving problems, everything is something which I don't get it with most thing I miss is my mum love. And my kind of attachment I had with my sister. This is a thing I miss most.
