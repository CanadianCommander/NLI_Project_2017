I think the most efficient type of transportation in my country is the train. Uh why the train because it's um usually on time. We don't have uh much delay, uh it's a very safe and secure way of transportation. Um the other thing is that it goes very fast compared to car for example a bus, it's uh usually less expensive than plane and um it's also very available to travel by train because it's usually the um uh the rooms are sound proof so you can read and work inside the the train.
