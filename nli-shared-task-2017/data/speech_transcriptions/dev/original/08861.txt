The special opportunity that I'm going to be talking about, is the job that I have at the moment. This job was first taken by me last year when I first came to Korea to teach English. The reason why it is very important, um the reason why it was special is because it was perfect timing as soon as I graduated from the university, as m-much as I wanted to get in to education it was very well related to the job that I was going to be hold. The second reason is that I was flying overseas to Korea where I could be more exposed to diversity of culture and people that I will be meeting in the future.
