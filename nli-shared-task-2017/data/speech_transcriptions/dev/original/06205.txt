From my point of view, a very important quality a member of a team should have is self, to be self confident, because otherwise he could not take part in a discussion within the team. The next aspect is that he or she should be able to listen to people and to try to manage the different opinions of the team members so that there will not be a conflict, but a solution of a problem the ma-, group wants to solve.
