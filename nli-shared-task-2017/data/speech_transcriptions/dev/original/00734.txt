If I can have any job or career I wanted I want to choose a professor. There are several advantages for that. One is that I have vacations in summer and winter and that I can take a trip. And the second one is that I can meet many young students while I'm going older. And the third one is that I want to study deeply in my field especially in English literature. I majored in Eng- I'm majoring in English literature in the University now. So I want to be a professor if I could.
