Uh the most efficient type of transportation in my country I will say is the railway transportation. Uh on of the reason it is because uh it can carry as many, more people than the air and the road and is so far the safest. Uh also railway transportation allow transpo- uh carrying of heavy load freight through long distances and uh remote areas that are not accessible to plane or road.
