The accomplishment I did was um to make it um in an marathon. It run over forty mile, over more than forty mile. And it was really hard for me because I have an heart disease. So I have to really train hard and go with my friends every time I have, I have free time to train hard for this marathon. And it's what is very important for me because I can show myself that I am, can do sports even if I have this heart disability, a heart disease. And so it was really lucky when I accomplished it, accomplished it.
