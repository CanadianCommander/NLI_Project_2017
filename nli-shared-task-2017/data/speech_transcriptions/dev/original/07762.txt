In my opinion there is a um there is two large uh value special values for members members of a team. The first one is leadership and leadership is <%15.4> lead on other person in the group member and it makes their team like more successful. And another one is cooperative skill um as group member work is always required cooperative skills and work together. So this cooperative skill makes average members more valuable during the team work or team assignments or perfect.
