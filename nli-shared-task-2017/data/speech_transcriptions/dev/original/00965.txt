I had any job to choose from I would choose to be an FBI. The reason I would like to be an FBI is because I could be anywhere at any place basically spying on people and doing something good for the government. I could go undercover because I have an option to act and to disguise myself into you know various uh stages. And I think being an FBI would basically suite my talents and skills at the same time. I always wanted to be in a, uh in a job or career that would serve the nation and I think FBI is the best job career that I can ever have. I would like to be a Federal Bureau Investigator.
