One of the most important accomplishments that required me to work very hard was a mock court competition, or a moot court competition that was held in our university. The reason why this was so important me was because of the, of the immense hard work that went into it and the amount, the number of hours that I put into working for this competition. And I also got to learn a lot from this particular competition, all this hard work paid off and eventually we did win this mock court competition. Uh the reason why it was important to me again uh is because it taught me a lot. It taught me how to go about finding things outside of the class going, going about and researching things on my own, and that why I feel this was important to me.
