The novel that belong to <%3.6> a French author is by far the best novel that I have ever read. The book talks about the experiences of Henry <%13.1> in his prison life life. He was convicted of a crime he did not commit. The most important thing the book taught me was <%23.2>. Besides that Henry <%24.8> had a tolerance and lastly the most important thing was he believed in himself that he would be acquitted, he would be freed of the guilt of the heinous crime that was murder. And one day, uh and one day go back to his family. The.
