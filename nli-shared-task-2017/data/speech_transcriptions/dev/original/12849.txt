I was read an uh interesting book about <%3.3> history and mythology. Uh I found many interesting topics uh in the book. For example one of them was uh a father uh giving an advice to his child about behaving himself and respecting others. And also there was some librarian, library, library keeper uh complaining about the uh incoming uh pe- people uh and not uh who weren't behaving themselves. I found them uh most interesting because I found uh they were parallel to uh what we experienced today in daily life.
