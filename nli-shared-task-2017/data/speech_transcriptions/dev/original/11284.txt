I think subway is the most efficient type of transportation in my country because uh subway is um always on time and is uh faster than the taxi if uh there are too many uh traffic. The the subway would would go um faster than taxi and is uh more cheap, and is is uh cheaper than taxi. So I usually uh use to take the subways so and it's very fast and is always on time. So the subway is the most efficient type of transportation.
