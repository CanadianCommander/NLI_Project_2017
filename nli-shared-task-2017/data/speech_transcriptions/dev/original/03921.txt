When I'm away I miss home a lot and there are three things I miss to the end. Uh first of all the food, the food is very hard to find in my university. I mean it's expensive, it's not sold twenty four hours a day but when I'm at home I can eat anytime I want. I just open the fridge, I take something to eat and I had the comfort of it and besides my mother is a great cooker, she's well in all the world and she make me feel healthy instead of eating fast food at school. And the second thing is I, of coarse I miss my family because being in a family is great, you know, you share things, you talk with people, and emotions too. And the third thing is comfort of being at the home just laying in a couch and sitting there and watching TV or talking.
