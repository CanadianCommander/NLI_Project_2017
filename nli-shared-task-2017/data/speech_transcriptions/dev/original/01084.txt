I find reading uh books, magazines, novels a very healthy and educational way of passing time. I don't have any particular preference I, uh to any particular author or any particular genre but yes I do particularity enjoy fantasies which are basically like the likes of Jack Tolkien, JKK Tolkien or uh James Clemens. I find fantasies in that sense to be really incredibly imaginative. You can completely soul out of the book and do whatever you're feeling. That is pro- probably the part of the magic of reading books. You can transport yourself wherever you want to be and whatever you want to think.
