In my opinion the most efficient type of transportation in my country is the train because um of our long culture, we have a very um good network so people can um travel from one point to the other in that country without any uh difficulties. Um it's not that um it's quite cheap and it's practical and you have time for yourself instead of being uh in the car and having to drive yourself, and you get to know a lot of different people.
