The reason that I work really hard these days, because I want to go to the good universities. When I graduate in the good universities, then I can get good job, and then I can be wealthy, and I can be more successful then when I do not work very hard. So it motivates me very well, so that I can try hard be my best, and I want to be uh acco- accomplished in the working. And then there isn't a besides the other reason is, I want to be successful person, and I want a good wife and yeah, those reasons.
