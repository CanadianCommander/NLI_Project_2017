What I most miss about uh being uh away from home is the uh first of all the, the meal because uh it used to be uh unlike my home. Uh next thing is the family and my friends who uh I miss a lot uh by being, when I am uh away from home. Uh I also miss a lot uh the weather uh because here the weather is very sunny and heat and somewhere, some, in other places uh it's uh like more wet and and I, I also miss my bedroom and my bed because it's uh uh particular uh.
