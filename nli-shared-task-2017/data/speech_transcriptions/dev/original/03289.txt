If I could choose any job or career I wanted I choose to be, be a pianist. The first reason I want to be a pianist is that I love piano, I can play piano every time I want. When I was sad I can play piano to express my feeling. The other reason is I want to become a pianist is that I can perform around the world if I have the ability. I can travel all around and show there, and show there my ability of piano. And that is my reason of becoming a pianist.
