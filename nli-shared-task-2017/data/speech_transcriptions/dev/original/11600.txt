I think the important quality for a team or grip- group member should have to succeed is confidence. The confidence level of the team lead depends uh dis- uh I'm sorry describes the success of the team. It is like this you see if the team lead is not confident in expressing the point he wants to convey and he wants to lead the team, then the other group members are not quite they are not going with the team lead, they'll not follow the team lead because he is not confident to express his points. If he is not confident enough to know uh to get what he wants then he can't get what he wants from the team. So according to me uh the most important quality that a team lead should have is a confidence for the success of the team so it is like this.
