The interesting book I have read is a book <%4.1> which was written by the English writer Dan Austin. The book is interesting because first is for the very satire language and is very attractive to me. Because my language is something very basic to the, to the novel or something like that. And the language is full of humors, I like that kind of thing. Besides it is quite some laugh you should see, <%31.5>. Not because love is romantic, it is also because that it reflects some understanding and a misunderstanding between males and females. So that I like this book.
