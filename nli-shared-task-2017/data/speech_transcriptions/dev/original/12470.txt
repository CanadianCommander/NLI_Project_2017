The accomplishment that I recall that required I to, that required me to work very hard was preparation for a scholarship requirement. For one thing I had to work very hard to meet my scholarship requirement. I had to spend eight hours a day in the library researching a lot of projects and studying there. And second reason is that I want to ease my parents financial burden and by receiving the scholarship I could help them financially for the first time in my life. I knew that the f- tuition fee will, will be burden for them and I was proud of myself for doing this.
