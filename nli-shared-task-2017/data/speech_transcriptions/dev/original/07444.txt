The quality that make a valuable member, the quality that a person should have which will make him valuable member of the team is determination. I mean it's only possible that can help a person grown in his ideas at the same time, he will be in a position to complete his project that has been assigned to him in a limited fashion. At the same time, he can maintain a good rapport with al his team members. He can be much more versatile as well. When he's determined to do his work, he can be versatile, he can try out different things and when he wants to put in all the hard-work, uh I don't think there is any task which is left out uncompleted. You can finish any task that has been given to him when he has the determination.
