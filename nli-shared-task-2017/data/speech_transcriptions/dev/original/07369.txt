I come from Italy and it's very difficult to say which is efficient the most efficient type of transportation in my country. I would say that is train even though the less um um transportation is for and is not very uh comfortable. Uh there are any problems um related to the culture and our not being in time. So, I would say that still we have some form of transportation and maybe are we are still um trying to improve this uh public um service. Um until now I have to say that <%> is the most used um transportation.
