Well if you ask me what is the most efficient type of transportation in your country, I'll say in my country is subway and bus. Subway and buses because I from Korea and Seoul has a lot of traffic so transportation, we need more faster and cheap. Buses are the most cheapest for transfer transportation to me and many people use buses because we have the only way to through a way buses line into Seoul. So we use.
