I personally think home in my houses I mostly miss my parents while I'm away, I miss the way that they treat me as a special person and I miss the way how they give me wings as to fly. I personally believe that I, I right now don't have the wings to fly on my own and I need my parents to be by my side. I also miss from my home my friends where we gather around and we learn from each other experiences since we share the same age, we share the same uh, share the s-, we share the same thoughts and the same experiences that I just love to be around these kind of people and just have fun.
