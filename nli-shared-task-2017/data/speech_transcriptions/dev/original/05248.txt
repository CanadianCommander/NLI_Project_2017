The interesting book uh which I have read, the Bro- uh Bowers Brothers which is, has been written the fifteenth century by a French writer. Uh it's mention about <%14.1> empire and the uh he's mention about the Pirate. so we know this in my country the <%20.6>. Uh this is the most interesting uh side in my opinion of course uh because the story is goes and and never you understand it whenever it will be finished. That's all.
