In the case uh a friend come to my country I would uh advise uh him to first go to the capital city of France, which is Paris because he would be able to, to do shopping and to, to visit historical things as the Eiffel Tower for example. Uh I would also advise him to go to south of France to see some beautiful landscape, place to see and also to get sun because it's a really sunny place. I would definitely advise him to, to visit uh, I mean to go to the mountain because you can fi- also beauti- beautiful landscape and do some great sports as skiing in the winter for example.
