Well I used to be an obese highly overweight girl who was the object of everybody's mockery and delusion and I would be laughed at everywhere I would go because I was, I would waddle in and out like a duck.

I started exercising regularly and today I can proudly claim to have lost fifteen kgs and I'm swelled youngster who's confident of the life ahead of me, I'm so proud.
