An accomplishment that required myself to work very hard was to join the varsity team to play soccer. This is because I was chosen from range of fifty candidates who were applying to play for the soccer team. And I had to train very hard, and this was very important to  me because I'm very keen soccer player and I really love the sport from deep down my heart. And I believe it was an important experience because my family wanted me to join the team as well.
