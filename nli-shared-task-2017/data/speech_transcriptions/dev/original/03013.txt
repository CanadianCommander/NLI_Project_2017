What I miss most about my home when I'm away is my leather chair, because I got a big blue leather chair in my living room. And I really like to sit down there, to lay down there watching TV, because I'm a kind of lazy guy. And what I miss too is my posters, because I got a lot of posters in my rooms, because I really like music. So I got a lot of posters, posters of different artists and I like it. So yeah and I, and I, and I like my carpet to. I got a blue and gray carpet which is coming from Iran, and is very beautiful, everybody likes it.
