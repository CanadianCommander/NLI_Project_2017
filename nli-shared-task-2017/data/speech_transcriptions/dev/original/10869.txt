In my country the most effective type of transportation is the car because unfortunately we don't have a good plan made in the streets for public transportation. We do have a new train and buses but few people use them because we don't have, like I said, an effective plan. The train only has like seven stops and to get to to this train stop, you have to go with the car. You cannot go walking. And the whole plan of the country has be fixed in order.
