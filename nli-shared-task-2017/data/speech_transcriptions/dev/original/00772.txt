One opportunity that I will cherish which helped me grow as a person is when I was appointed prefect in my high school. First to start off with it made me more responsible person. I would be there on time to check up on the duties. And then the second thing that I would appreciate about the work is I have learned how to deal with the people. And last but not least it helped me grow as a person, as you are asked to deal with different kinds of people as well as to manage your duties you learn to become more responsible as a person.
