I think the quality that makes one a valuable member of a team is to have leadership uh that because uh the team is from the first uh, uh made for uh achieving some goals so with that leadership uh the team cannot uh succeed in solving the problems of achieving the goal. So leadership is a basis of the team. So that's why I think that it is very important uh.
