I choose to be a teacher if in case I 'm an option to choose my career .
Uh I would choose this particular teacher profession because I have always been inspired by teachers , the way they impart the knowledge and the way that they do for different types of students .
It is really a challenging job and it is not a very easy job , and so a teacher impart knowledge into the students in different manner and we get to face different types of students at different levels .
So it is a challenging a teacher 's life to impart knowledge in different types of students based on their capability and capacity .
The other part of their aspects is judging them , which is again a major task .
This inspire me to be a teacher .
