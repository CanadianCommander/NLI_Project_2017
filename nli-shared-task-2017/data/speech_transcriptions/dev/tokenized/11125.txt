The thing I miss most when I 'm away from home , is probably my friends and my family and the people that I spend my time with .
Because well they , they are al - well I love them all very much .
And the other thing I miss is my daily program like getting up and going to school and , and my friends at school , and the teachers and everything .
And then when I come back home , like meeting up with a friend or maybe even studying for class uh doing home work or like and not going on the Internet and my daily program .
I really love my life a lot so uh when I 'm away from home I really miss that a lot .
