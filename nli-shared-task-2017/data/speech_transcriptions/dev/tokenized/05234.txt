I think the most um effective way of transportation in my country is by car .
Um it 's because of the delays which often occur if you use a train .
So the uh the train system is n't developed very well , um but in spite if this the highways called in Germany are developed really really well so you can travel quite fast and efficiently from big towns .
The the system of highways connects all the big cities with more that approximately fifty thousand inhabitants and therefore one has now the problem to reach nearly every place in in very short time .
I I I would exclude the plane from efficient type of .
