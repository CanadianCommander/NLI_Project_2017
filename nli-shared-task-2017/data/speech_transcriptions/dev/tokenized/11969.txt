What I miss most about home is being with my family and friends , more specifically my parents uh for they have guided me throughout my whole life as a te - , their child and now as a teenager and I still need more of the , that guidance because I do not feel comfortable in this world that uh offers challenges and new ideas that I have n't been fully prepared for .
And so I miss the comfort my parents give me and the love and affection they give me also .
