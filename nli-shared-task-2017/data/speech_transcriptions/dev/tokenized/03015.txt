The most important thing that I miss when I 'm away from home , is the patient and care of my family members .
The only person that can live home they have family members to look for him , to care for him .
The second most important thing that I miss is the food , the food that my mum cooks .
And the food , the variety of food that is available in the city .
When I 'm away from home I have to rely on the meshes or the canteens for my fooding , feeding .
The turning point thing is the inexpensive convenience in my city or basically where I 'm from , the convenience is very cheap .
But in the city where I am right now studying is quite expensive .
