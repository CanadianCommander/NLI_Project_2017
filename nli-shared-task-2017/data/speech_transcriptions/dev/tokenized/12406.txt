I think the quality that makes someone a valuable member of a team is that if she , if she or he is a considerate person uh often , often in a team people need to cooperate with go , need to work together and and if one is too hard , do n't think about others , if one person do n't think about others , does n't think about others then the team will not success , so I think considerate person is the more important .
