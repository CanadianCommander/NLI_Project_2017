The job or career I would like to be is a professor 's career .
I like it the most of all because my career gives us a chance to be with the youth till we are retired or old age .
This gives me a pleasant feeling of being uh by being with them and mingling with them .
We can even see how the generations change time to time .
The changes in their moral values , their IQ and intellect , their means of learning and so on .
I can even do some sort of research in that position and even grow the future of the generations and have a good position in the society .
So I prefer to go for a career .
