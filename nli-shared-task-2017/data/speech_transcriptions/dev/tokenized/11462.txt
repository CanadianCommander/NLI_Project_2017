If I could have any job or career I would become a pilot .
I think it 's very exciting , just the whole thought about flying an aircraft and also you get to see the world and I love traveling .
So by becoming a pilot I can get to see so many new places and stay in the best of the places .
Also I would get to meet so man people from different cultures because while you 're flying them .
It 's uh an exciting job also because you can see the world , you , you know you 're flying a , a plane in the sky and it 's just beautiful because I have seen the sky how it looks from an aircraft and it 's just really exciting to be flying an aircraft .
And it 's such a huge machine and i - it 'll make me really proud if I could fly one , if I would choose to become a pilot .
