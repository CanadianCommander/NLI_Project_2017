When I 'm out of my home I miss almost everything really .
I missed , I miss my sleep actually uh in a new , new environment I will not sleep uh effectively as I sleep in home and I also miss the food and my mum cooks a delicious food which I miss wherever I go and I 'll always uh like to take the food in home .
And I also miss my sister which is always , where she 'll be always with me and we 'll be talking to each other that really she is a great company .
So I miss the friendship of my sis whenever I go out of the home .
And also the love of my mum who makes me to sleep whenever I 'm I 'm really not aslee - not asleep so I miss a lot .
