Most interesting book that I have read recently would be Harry potter .
The entire series of the ha - of Harry Potter is very enlightening and takes you into a different world of imagination and magic .
J. K Rowling has been very successful in creating a sm - a mystic world of magic where every reader is mystified by the wonders created by Harry Potter and his friends .
The , the school they got to go even is very uh commendable and it enlightened by magic by itself , the great hall and every other place .
