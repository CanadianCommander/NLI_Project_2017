If my friend were coming to my country I 'd like to take my friend to mount Fuji .
They are two reason to support my answer .
One is that mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan and has a beautiful view and also a cone shape .
It uh really familiar around the world .
And also the second reason is that they had a lot of snow in winter .
Also there are a lot of people from other country never seen the snow in their life so I think it can be great opportunity for them to see this kind of view .
