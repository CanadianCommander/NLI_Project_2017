My accomplishment required uh me to work very hard , was uh studying abroad for a year in America .
I went to America when I was a sophomore in high schools and uh at that time I could n't speak English and I even I could n't understand the English very well .
So it was very hard to you know adjust the English s - situation .
But um , um but la - later I could be getting used to the uh American and help us speak English uh , uh better so .
