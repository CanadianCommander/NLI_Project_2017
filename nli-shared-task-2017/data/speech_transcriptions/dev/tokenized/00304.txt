In my free time , I prefer reading novels and magazines but not poetry .
I do n't really like poetry because um it 's too smart and too it 's not very um I do n't know .
I prefer novels and magazines .
Um I prefer magazines because it 's about uh daily life .
Uh it can be about fashion , about um about people , about economy and it 's very interesting .
It 's about uh the people and the world we live in and novels because it 's short stories sometimes very interesting .
