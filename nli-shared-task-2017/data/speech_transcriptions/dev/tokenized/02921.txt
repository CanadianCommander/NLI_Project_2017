I live in Luino on Lake Maggiore .
This is a small town and uh we could move on our foot but everyone moves by car because uh this the best type of transportation for us .
There are also train , boats and bus but all these type of transportation are uh inefficient .
They are always uh late and um especially the um the train are always um are too less and we are uh not uh very good uh .
