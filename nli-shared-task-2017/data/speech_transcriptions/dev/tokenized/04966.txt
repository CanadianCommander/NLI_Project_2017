I like to read more magazines than novels or poetry .
I like this , I like read this in my free time because the material that show in magazines is more accurate uh beginning with the beginning of the magazine there can be signs of politics , uh can show me how is doing the war and interactions between governments and cultures .
It also show me the possibilities of the future and how the economy and the world is dealing with global movements .
