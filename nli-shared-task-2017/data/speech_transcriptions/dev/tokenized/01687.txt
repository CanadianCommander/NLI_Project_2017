I think the most active type of transportation in my country is uh the train or the railway because it 's good infrastructure , you can reach every city and everywhere with it .
Uh it is good prices of uh transportation and it 's not that expensive , all the , although it 's um the reliability on it is very high and it 's always on point , it 's not late or anything else .
So I think um the railway is um more efficient than the car or anything else because you have time to do your work and stuff like that .
