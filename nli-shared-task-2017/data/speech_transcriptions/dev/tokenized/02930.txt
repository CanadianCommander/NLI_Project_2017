Uh generally in my free time I like very much to read novels and magazines .
Instead I do n't really like poetry .
I read novels because it is a means for me for and to new and fantastic words or to prove some new experience and feelings .
And magazines are usual for me also for my studies .
So I can have some more news like architectural news or uh also , news of the word and this make me aware of what happen .
