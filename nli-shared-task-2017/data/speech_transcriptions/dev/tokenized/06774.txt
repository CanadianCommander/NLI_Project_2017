The special opportunity that I got uh last year was uh social service opportunity because I love to do social services and uh because I can serve people I can poor and needy .
And uh it was consisting of uh of raising funds and collecting um clothes and necessary things that kids and uh old people need .
And uh I did that uh pretty well I think because I could raise uh good amount of funds and it was actually um required uh kids uh who were very much in need of funds for their treatment and uh for all their necessary uh things to go on .
