I prefer to pick novel because novel has use - used to have a lot of uh deeper meaning within in the stories and then there is more details in the novels .
For example , may part my favorite novel 's name is ` The Brave New World ' written by Huxley .
In that novels , he describe uh a range of knowledge behind that real story which is a Utopian world and society .
So I always learn a lot of things from the novels and then to also to practice English skills and so on .
So I like to , I like to read novels and that is my favorite reading material .
