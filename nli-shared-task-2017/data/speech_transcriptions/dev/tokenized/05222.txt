A really interesting book that have been read uh during my period of student is called The Quiet American .
I personally think it is relative interesting because of the love triangle that the characters Phuong , Fowler and Pyle was trying to express in their relationship and the background of the , of the middle China war .
Uh from this I think the author relatively precise in details that he expresses about the emotionals and the relations between the characters .
Furthermore I think it is quite amazing that .
