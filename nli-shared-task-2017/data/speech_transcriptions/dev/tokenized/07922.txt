I can be able research and I want to apply that uh uh knowledge into the job at the , and I do after graduation so I have to give my knowledge to the job so that I can develop many more knowledge and can learn more things about the job and uh I can implement the more uh thoughts uh that could I have in uh uh gradua - graduation .
So I need to go for the job rather than the career because the , I need to imple - I need to implement the things what I have the graduation so that even working for this job is the best option .
