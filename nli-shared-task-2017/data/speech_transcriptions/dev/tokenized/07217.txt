Special opportunity the opportunity that was given to me was a scholarship in the American fields of Scholarships program , and I was sent along with a few of my friends to the United States to the family there and experience life in different culture .
This program was for two years and it taught me a lot of things like living in a different culture , it taught me about how families function there and also it fulfilled my dream about learning about more peoples and different cultures .
The aim in my life is to graduate in international business and so this was an opportunity which helped me blend with a variety of cultures in a period of one year in which I lived away from my home , this also taught me .
