I think a person with a good leadership quality qualifies him as a very good person of a team .
This is because uh if a person is very efficient in leading a team uh naturally the team will work efficiently and uh reap the results as one required favorably .
Uh th next one is that uh if the leader is good and he is leading the team properly the team members feel encouraged and they will work along with him uh giving him be - benefits and results .
Uh the leadership also should not combine too much superiority and he should work along with the team , so that the team members should not feel .
