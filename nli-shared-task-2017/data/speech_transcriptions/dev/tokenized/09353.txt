Well as far as I 'm concerned I prefer to be an investment banker , the investment banker .
There are some reasons for this , the first one is the rapid growth of the Chinese economy brought so many opportunities .
So I think I can contribute all myself to the countries economic environment .
And my father is a banker too , I want to be a person like him .
The second one is risk , I love risk , we should be adventure in our lives , is our fate .
So I really want to be the winner in stocks , and my major is the finance and banking .
I have that in my answer , the necessary knowledge and ability .
So I think I can , could be a very good banker in the future .
That is my answer , thank you very much .
