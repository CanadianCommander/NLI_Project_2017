The book that I liked reading is The Sword of Tipu Sultan .
I like this book because it captures the history of the time .
It is a , it is a book about how Tipu Sultan grew up and fought against the British .
So it captures very well the struggle between the British efforts to capture the State of Mysore and Tipu Sultan 's efforts to uh defend it .
It also shows uh kinds of intrigues , the palace intrigues and other kinds of intrigues which were very clearly stated at that time .
