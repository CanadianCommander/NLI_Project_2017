I recommend uh the capital of Lebanon , Beirut because it 's very nice uh city and it 's uh close to the beach .
And uh the too much tourist all the time uh , uh spend a lot of time there .
And because uh it 's uh a city of the night , with all uh the clubs , and night clubs uh always open seven days a week .
Uh and uh all the people are generous , very nice .
Everyone would , would love and uh a hundred percent would like it .
