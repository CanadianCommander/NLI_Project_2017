I 've been out of my home in several times in the last one , was one month ago yes .
I went on and I missed a lot of things around my home .
Then maybe the most important was my , the company when you arrive home and you can see your your brother or your mother to say hallo and talk something out talk to them .
And also I miss my dog and I like being and playing with him .
Another thing that I used to miss is the cook because I know when I do go abroad I had different dishes and you are not the way they cook it is different that in your country .
And also my bed because you know you do n't sleep at home like at home every where .
