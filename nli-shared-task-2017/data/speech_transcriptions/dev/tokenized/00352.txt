What I miss most uh about my home when uh when I 'm away is my li - my living room .
In fact uh first of all because uh it 's a place where all the family uh come together and where , where we can even chat with uh with your brothers and sisters and everything uh so it 's a very familiar place and secondly because uh it 's a place for example where there is the television and uh the living room get , can get me to relieve uh stress and to uh to concentrate or to think uh to other things for uh these reasons I really miss uh my living room when I am , when I am away from home .
