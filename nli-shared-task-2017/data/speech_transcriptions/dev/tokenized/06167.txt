Well I 'm not the kind of who really likes to read but if I would have to choose between novels , magazines or poetry I definitely will go for magazines .
Uh basically what I would choose would be maybe uh cars or sports , just stuff that I really like .
Like for example , I would choose um I would choose uh and sports magazine because I love soccer and I really think that I 'm into sports .
Um I do n't really like poetry but uh um I 'm reading right now Shakespeare in my English class .
So I do n't know .
