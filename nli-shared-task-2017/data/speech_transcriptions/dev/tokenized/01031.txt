The opportunity I had was a very special opportunity for me that was given to me in , my third year .
I w-I had to represent my college at a college seminar , there were so many students and uh there were so many country participated there , and uh I had research on so many topics there .
And I had one topic that were totally different from my my major and I had to search on the topic and on this research .
And this research showed me like uh uh I had I had many weeks to go and uh if I 'm doing research mean that it stops my career I can have my career in other things also .
