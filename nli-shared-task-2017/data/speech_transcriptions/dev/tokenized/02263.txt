If I would have been given an option to choose any job or career which I wanted I would become an entrepreneur and more specifically in that field I would become a restaurateur because I feel that you know , I 've got a good hospitality jobs etcetera and I 'm also very keen on that business and plus also my family business , and you know , help my parents and and I would still open one restaurant in my hometown and you know maybe the subsidiaries to the same .
