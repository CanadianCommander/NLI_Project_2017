So um news and information and background is very important for me .
That 's why I usually read uh a lot of daily newspapers , a lot of weekly newspapers and I 'm also very passionate about reading uh news magazines and all kind of economic magazines .
Um I read uh publications from uh Austria which is my own country from Germany .
From Great Britain as of as from the US and um I also read uh due the fact that I would like to learn about politics and history , I lead I read uh non-fiction books and uh sometimes yeah I also read poetry and literature .
