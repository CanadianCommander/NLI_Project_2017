Um , uh playing piano uh require a lot of hard work everyday because you need to practice and you need to for it .
You need tailored in you and for that uh you need to , I do n't know , know everything about playing piano in you .
And it was very important for me because my thesis uh out , really loved playing piano .
And I like watching her playing piano .
So it was really important for me .
I do n't know , that made me feel special .
Without playing piano , I felt very close to her , even though she was far away .
