I think uh , uh the quality uh that someone makes a valuable member of a team is uh to be faithful .
I think everybody in a team uh should rely on the other person .
And so it is very important that they can trust each other and uh to be faithful , uh to have a per - , per - , per - , person in the team that is faithful .
It is always uh secure for yourself .
You can go back and uh tell them uh things you 're concerned about or uh ask uh questions and you always know that the other person will tell you the truth about it .
That 's why I think faithfulness is the most value of a member in a team .
