Working in Pharma industry maybe I took the examination because as my background is masters of science in organic chemistry and which is uh completely research oriented and working in pharmaceutical industry will have plenty of options in synthesis laboratories .
And also I prefer to work in Pharma industry .
Apart from preferring working my qualifications I also interested in pharmaceutical job .
Why ?
Because as in research career we can de - deliver or develop a drug which can uh uh which can uh future generations uh without uh free from uh uh many types of diseases and all .
So pharmaceutical in job which I prefer is most .
Thank you .
