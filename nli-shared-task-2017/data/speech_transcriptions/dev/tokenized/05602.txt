I used to live , I 've been living away from home since uh two thousand and two and what I miss the most when , while I 'm away is obviously my fam - , my dad , my s - , my mother and my sister .
I also miss my friends because uh when I 'm home I spend most of the time with them , going out and having fun with them .
What I miss probably the most from my family is uh the food cause my mum is a great cook and while I 'm away I have to prepare food on my own so probably food , friends are the things uh I miss the most .
