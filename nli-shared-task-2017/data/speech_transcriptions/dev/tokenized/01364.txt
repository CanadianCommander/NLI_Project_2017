When I 'm away from the home , the things I mostly miss is my mums care and the family love that I have got through the time that I have lived with them .
The most important , the other most important thing is the homely atmosphere .
You generally drain that comfort in other places that you find at home .
Your own room the attached bathroom and toilet .
Apart from that the other facilities that you have .
You simply miss them every time you go out and this what it happens with me .
I miss the homely atmosphere lot .
And apart from that home food is one of the most important things that I miss .
