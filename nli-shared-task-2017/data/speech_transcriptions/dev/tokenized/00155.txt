More special , it was given to me is a scholarship that I was awarded with for my undergraduate studies as a civil engineer .
It was special in a way that it allowed me to attend a very high , high ranked university and not have to repay back .
Since my income at the time was basically no because I did n't have any job and my parents could n't um , could n't pay for my undergraduate studies .
That is why it was really , really important to me , it was special .
