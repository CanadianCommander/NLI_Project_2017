My uh most uh hard accomplishment was uh a running tournament .
It was uh show jumping .
And it was very hard for me because I 'm not very good at uh riding and uh especially in the show jumping .
So I needed a lot of uh other riding lessons and it was very hard .
Uh I was uh always uh thrown down by the horse uh in front of the obstacles and uh it was not so , I was not so happy .
And uh , but at the end uh , the , all these uh worth .
