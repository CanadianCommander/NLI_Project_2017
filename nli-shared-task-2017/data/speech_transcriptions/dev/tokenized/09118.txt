First I would uh show , my friends from another country uh Frankfurt because it is one of the biggest cities in Germany and I live very close to Frankfurt so I know it .
Um uh quite , quite good and um the biggest advantage of Frankfurt is that you can go um for shopping there very well and there are a lot of culture things you can do and uh um the second city I would show them is Mainz because I go there to , to the university and is the best place to just go them to go to pubs .
