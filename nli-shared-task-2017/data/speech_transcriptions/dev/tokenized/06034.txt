I was given a special opportunity of to head the branch of futures first to India , Bangalore branch of futures India and that .
That opportunity was really special and important for me because I got it in just two , two years of work experience as a trader .
This experience was really not enough for anyone to head a branch which is a managerial post and it is very big post to head to get and in I got it in two years time that was , that was very special and important for me .
And uh I did n't have any experience or that exposure to management but I got it just on the basis of the promise which I showed , so that is why this opportunity was very important for me .
