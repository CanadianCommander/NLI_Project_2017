Okay , um the most efficient type of transportation in my country is the underground .
Um I 'm talking about the un - underground .
Um it 's efficient because um there 's no traffic , so you can get from one point to another and and there 's not going to be any any um any stop any uh that time .
Uh so uh another thing that makes it efficient uh could be okay the um the um uh many many trains that um every couple of minutes .
