I think patient is the most important thing when people need it as a member of a team .
For example when uh , when I worked a project in my ESL class , one of my friend quit doing the work and just , just did nothing and our team failed miserably and uh the project 's score was very bad , so I was very disappointed with my friend and how she work as a team member .
So , I think patience and being , working very hard is very important as a team worker in a group .
