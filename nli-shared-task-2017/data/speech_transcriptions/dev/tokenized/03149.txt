I suggest them to visit uh Kashmir first of all , which is the , as they call it the heaven on earth .
So is uh , it is , um it is um so impo - uh is , is , it 's good that they visit this uh state and , and then see the beauty there , beauty of the nature .
And then uh the Golden Temple at Amritsar is a world wide scene .
It 's uh a place of worship and uh , and uh , and my , my environment there is so peaceful .
It brings you so much of calmness .
And then the , they must visit Bombay which is uh shopping place and then Delhi , which is uh very much metropolitan city .
