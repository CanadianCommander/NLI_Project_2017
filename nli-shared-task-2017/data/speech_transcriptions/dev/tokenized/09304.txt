It very hard , was uh the National Engineering entrance examination .
Ever since childhood I had the fascination for the engineerings and the discoveries made by it .
So I was certainly very , very uh enthusiastic about uh getting selected in this examination .
So I , I worked very hard for about , for the whole one year , and uh finally I got into it .
And uh because I had to work very hard to get into this uh , entrance examination , it was uh , and thus equally sat - satisfaction for me .
So that was the accomplishment which required me to work very , very hard .
