I had a special opportunity that was given to me , it was the opportunity to participate in summer investigation , in summer internship in the medical science campus of the university of Puerto Rico , uh .
I believe this was a very special opportunity for me in many aspects especially in the sense of academic preparation .
I believe that if you have the opportunity to do a summer internship it would help you not only academically and professionally but in your life experiences , this is because your immersed in participating with many other students in an investigation .
