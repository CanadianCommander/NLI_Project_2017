One thing I really miss about home when I 'm away from it is the food almond and and they used to my mother 's style of cooking and I really miss that when I 'm not there .
Uh another thing which I miss about my home is my family and they attach my family and I just love every uh member of my family .
Also being a born in joint family I really uh value the place each and every member has in my life .
Thirdly I miss the uh environment of my home , uh at home I can relax on the couch watch television do almost anything I feel like , and uh really what I miss the most when I 'm at home , when I 'm away from .
