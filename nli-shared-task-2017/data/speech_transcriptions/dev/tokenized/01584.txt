If asking for , uh for my state which is and this was because I was uh not only good at the sport but they wanted my academic performance also to be good which was uh pretty much uh favorable in terms of the requirements .
Um they did n't only appreciate what I had done uh in my sports field in my school but they also appreciated my other co-curricular activities such as uh playing instruments music .
And the only reason I really think this was a big opportunity for me was because I was in the state level and it really made me bring honor to the state as well .
