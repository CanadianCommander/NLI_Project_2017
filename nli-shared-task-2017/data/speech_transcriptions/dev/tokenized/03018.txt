What I miss the most when away is basically two points .
On one end there are my friends which I know from high school or from other uh kindergarten et cetera uh and on the other end there 's my family uh my brother , my sister and of course my parents .
And yeah , I spend a lot of time with them during my childhood and uh I , of course I miss that time because uh yeah , when I 'm at my place of study I can not see them , I can not do anything with them the , the sole thing I can do is to call them and yeah , uh I can only take the time for my other students .
