What I miss most about my home when I 'm away is uh specially the food that my mum cooks and also the conformity of the house .
I like the food my mum cooks because it has a special flavor , it has a special taste that I can give up .
And the comformity of my ho - home is never to be found somewhere else .
I like to lie on my sofa , I like the way that my room is decorated and I uh like the warmity of the house , and uh I like its Ora uh .
When you walk into the room that it , that strikes you .
