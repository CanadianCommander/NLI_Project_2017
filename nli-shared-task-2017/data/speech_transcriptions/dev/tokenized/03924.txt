That was given me when I was in college has been to , to work in the library .
Because doing that I was able to , to have a lot of books to , to read and to prepare my exam and I was able to meet a lot of students to ask them about suggestions about the exam that I had to prepare and I really used that job um also for doing money but above all for paying my exams and it worked really really well .
So I think that it has been a great opportunity .
