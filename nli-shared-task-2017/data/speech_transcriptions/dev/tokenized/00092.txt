Lately I have been um asking to go on an exchange with the university um that was a great opportunity for me to see new cultures like to go oversees to go like in the United States .
Uh this is very different culture , this is a very different language , what helps you or to to understand to be more intelligent about what you hear to understand other languages .
And this is a new environment with new laws or new like to shop or to go on a bank is very different like in your own country , and this was a great opportunity for me .
