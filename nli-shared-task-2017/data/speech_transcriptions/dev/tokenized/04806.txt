Special opportunity that was given to me was when my friend asked me to go to New Zealand with her , she has a pen friend there and I really wanted to go there because it was my dream .
So first I went there for the language , it permitted me to learn a new language English with a different accent from what I already knew .
And then because of the culture I had seen so many things about New Zealand and Maori culture so I we - I went there to see that it was very , very uh good to me .
And then I could do the , I would just tell the history of the Maori people and the war about the New Zealand uh between New Zealand and Maori .
