When I 'm away from home , I miss lots of things .
In fact um I 'm quite often from home because uh I sadly away from home .
The thing I miss the most is my house because I live uh in apartment , every year I change apartment basically .
And I really like my house and I miss it .
And then I miss persons , my friends , and my family of course .
And when I come back , for a weekend or for holidays I 'm really happy to see them and spend time with them .
And then I miss uh the environment of my town because I live in the mountains , so I miss nature .
