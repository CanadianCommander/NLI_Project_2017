In the year two thousand and six I was given the opportunity to spend a year abroad in the USAas a foreign exchange student I had insight to different cultures and different people .
Academically , I have developed more insight on , on , on matters in different country .
In the USAmany viewpoints are different from the ones here in Europe and especially in Germany .
The people I got to know will be forever in my memories , I never wanted uh to stay in Germany for all my life , so my stay in America was a good experience .
