During my free time I like to read mostly magazines , this is because first of all it 's entertaining .
I 'm the kind of person who ca n't concentrate on serious issues like things that come up in newspapers but magazines are really fun to read .
And second of all they 're up to date so I can keep track of um keep up with modern events and what 's new and what 's interesting and what 's fun to do in these and also they 're really detailed so it gives me a better sense of how to do these new things and how to um appreciate these modern events that are going on .
