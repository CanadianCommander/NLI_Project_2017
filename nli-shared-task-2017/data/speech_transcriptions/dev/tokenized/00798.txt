Um , when I 'm away from my home , what I miss the most is especially my family and all my habits with them .
For example on some days I used to go hang out with my father and my brothers .
So we have a big rand-some stuff .
I also miss going out with my friends and all my social habits like all going to cafe , French cafe with them .
Going to the movie and all those things .
I 'm also very close to my sister so I miss her a lot and also my home .
I think all these little things that are around us in our every , everyday life .
It 's what I miss the most um , and that 's what I think about when I 'm abroad but I also miss my country a little bit .
