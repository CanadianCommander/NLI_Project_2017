Okay , as I am a Korean living in China , Beijing therefore I am technically always away from home .
I always miss my , well , I was born in Beijing actually so I could say Beijing is my home but my mother 's home and my father 's home where my grandmother and grandfather lives I always miss that place .
Uh I miss my grandma 's food , I really miss it everyday and I miss the air there because it 's in the countryside of Korea , it 's much better than the air in Beijing .
And I miss the beach .
It 's in the seaside so when I am , when I go to Korea , when I go to my grandma 's house I can always stay at the beach .
