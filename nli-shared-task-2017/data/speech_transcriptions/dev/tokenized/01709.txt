An interesting book that I read was the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown .
Uh the , what really amaze me was uh the suspense and uh how how he was able to write the , the whole plot .
Uh it had crime elements of in it where , where the reader does n't really know who is the killer .
Uh Dan Brown also used very accurate uh words to describe uh all the details .
Uh we also get the picture about the places where where where the action takes place .
Uh it has also maybe a historical drawback uh drawing of the situations although uh some critics might say that it is a bit inaccurate what this is .
