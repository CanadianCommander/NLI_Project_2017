I studied one interesting book that is uh , that is the interesting book because in that uh book < % 10.8 > so many interesting topics that means how to read and uh in detail how to grasp matter .
That means he specified on uh where the place and title read the anything from the reverse .
That 's why you can struggle the first time later we can get easily , easy to um study .
Later we can uh easily uh go through the matter and we can easily confirm the matter .
That 's why I study so many things in my um primary and yet I like this way that 's why I got good , that 's why it 's important to me .
