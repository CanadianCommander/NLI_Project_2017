The most special opportunity that was given to me was my exchange here in the U.S.A .
I was sixteen years old when I decided on going abroad for one year but unfortunately my parents did n't have enough money to enable me to become an exchange student .
Luckily , I found a program of the German government that offered scholarship for young students and I eventually got the scholarship and with it the chance to start a new life in the U.S.A .
That was a great opportunity for me because it changed my life and my future plans drastically .
