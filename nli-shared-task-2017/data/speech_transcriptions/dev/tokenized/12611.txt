Um I like to read novels in my free time and I just uh read a novel about the was called Blink .
It was about um just psychological things and how your unconscious um reacts on certain things that you uh that you experience in your life or that you go through .
And um how you change your personality without noticing it because it all happens in your unconscious and I guess so uh I read recently The Catcher in the Rye and it 's just a novel about a young kid who experiences a lot because he drops out of high school and he does n't he does n't wanna go home because he 's scared of his parents and he spends like I think four or five days on his own in New York City and yeah .
