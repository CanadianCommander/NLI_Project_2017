Well if you take it keen look at this question it seems that it 's some kind of but there are several transportation opportunities for instance the rail roads , the planes and of course there is just in time transportations via roads .
So the vast majority of transportation is based on these tracks and some kind of vans there are indispensable for transportation .
To put it in a nut shell there are many opportunities that can be used for trans - uh transportation and what I had to say is that it 's most of it it 's just in time transportation .
