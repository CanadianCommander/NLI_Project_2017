Well uh the biggest accomplishment I just uh had was definitely my exam .
I graduated in law just a couple weeks ago and that really required a lot of work and it was very hard .
Uh first of all uh of course it was very important for my own future career uh to , yeah to graduate and to , to , to achieve in my exam .
And uh secondly it was a huge amount of work because there is so many different laws you have to learn and so many different subjects and topics .
So that was really , really hard and uh of course very important for me , as it concerns my future in such important way .
