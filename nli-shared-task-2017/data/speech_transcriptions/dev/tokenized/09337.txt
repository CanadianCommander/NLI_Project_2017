A special opportunity that was given to me was in two thousand and four , fall two thousand and four when I was able to come here to America to study English a little better .
I , my parents offered me this opportunity to just get away form my country and maybe from my friends and to just make new experience all on my own .
It has been a great experience ever since then I 've made lots of new friends .
I 've got to know different cultures different um traditions in those cultures .
And I 've learned how to accept different people and though they might not be in the same opinion about certain topic as I wa - I am and I was .
