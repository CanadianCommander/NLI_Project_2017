I scholarship like now in the year two thousand and two .
While doing my BA it was very important for me that I make a place in my college and I wanted to make the people know me there , and to do that I had to work hard .
My dream was to get better rate about excellence given to those students who had secured the maximum marks in the examinations and I did that .
It was indeed a moment of joy after my hard work was paid and I play was walking on the red carpet to get the prize from the Principal of my college .
And from that moment onwards life changed there because then I was know for whom I was uh .
