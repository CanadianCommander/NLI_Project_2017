This summer going to China as uh experience in a foreign country .
For me experience was very important for several reasons , first I have the chance to met a lot of new people and there was a lot of social interaction going on this was very important for me , and more over it was important to be independent from my parents because I used to live at home .
Till then so it was a chance to me to extend my own feet and I had a lot of really tough experiences because nobody was able to speak in English in China so I was kind of a big a challenge being there alone this was very important for me .
