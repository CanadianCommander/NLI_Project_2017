Well I prefer novels over magazines or poetry because they give us a lot of information not only regarding what to do and what not to do because also about human behaviors and the way people react to certain situations it gives more of a very practical and practical knowledge and it gives a vast variety of knowledge .
It can help you imagine things which you can only think of um in your not even think of in your dreams and all .
It uh it turns your dreams into reality , it can make you imagine things which you would otherwise not be able to do and it will give uh at the same time it will also give you a thing to work out as to .
