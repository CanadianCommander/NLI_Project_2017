Special opportunity I was given is to go on a trip to Germany for three weeks .
There I was supposed to learn little more of German and also to develop my skills in the speaking area .
This was really important to me because one of my future career is has to do with speaking languages , foreign languages and learning German is one of the important things in Europe mainly .
And I also , it was important for me because I met lots of people , different cultures and different ways of rela - relationships with between pe - people .
