Uh I think the most special opportunity to me is my first job , um because before I earn money by my self I just living with mom and uh study at the school and I do n't know how to uh grow up by my self .
So after I have my first job I have to take responsibility to myself and uh need to face uh trouble , some problem to solve by myself and a - ability to earn money , yes uh so I think I can make some contribution to the society .
