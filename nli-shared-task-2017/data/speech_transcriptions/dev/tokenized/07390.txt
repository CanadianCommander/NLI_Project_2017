Special opportunity that was given which I hold with the grace of God is the one that pertains to setting up of an ID centre at Budapest on behalf of IBM Global services .
The most important reason why I value this opportunity is primarily due to the fact that it gave me a lot of global exposure and in addition to this it help me transition an entire team which involve people from all over the world varying from Scotland to Turkey to Istanbul as part of the huge global company called Unilever .
Another reason I particularly enjoy this my real love for travelling so is that it gave me an opportunity to go to an exotic destination is a great learning experience .
