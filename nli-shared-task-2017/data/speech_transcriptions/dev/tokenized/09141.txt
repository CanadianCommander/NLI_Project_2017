Uh the help I put in the team helps a lot , because uh when the team is stuck in something and any kind of , uh , and any kind of problem that the team has like he could just help and , and provide us with whatever help we need and the team could move on to uh what we 're trying to accomplish and sometimes we have struggles as a team , but that team member could just help us in whatever problem we have .
And , and that could really be helpful in the team .
And , and cooperation as well you know is what consider as team work and all that .
