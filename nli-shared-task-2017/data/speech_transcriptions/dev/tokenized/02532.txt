I normally do n't read books but uh I read newspapers everyday because I 'm interested in the daily life news and uh it gives me more than reading a book about someone 's life or some other things .
It 's more important to me to get to know to the news of life and I think it 's more important to be up-to-date with politic issues and uh other things than reading books .
