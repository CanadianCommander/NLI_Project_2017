A very important opportunity that was given to me by the university was the Erasmus program .
An exchange program of six months in England .
Uh I had uh the possibility to study in uh , in another university .
So to improve another language and at the same time to meet other people from different countries and with different uh , uh culture .
Uh it was very funny but at the same time very um interesting and after that uh , uh , um , uh , uh , uh I became a different person .
