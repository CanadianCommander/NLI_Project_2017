Uh I come from they are together with my family .
Naturally I miss my parents and some of my friends .
I also miss my home and the calm , calmer atmosphere there .
Uh and my I miss my mum and the good food and all that would include coming to .
I miss my friends and doing stuff together with them , going to cinema meeting and at cafes or restaurants .
Yeah it 's away trying to live in another country but uh now I know what what is called belong to .
