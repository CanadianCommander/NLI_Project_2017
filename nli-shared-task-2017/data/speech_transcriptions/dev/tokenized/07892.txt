In my country Japan , the most efficient type of transportation would be trains because Japan is not a very big country and it 's very crowded so cars would not be a very good idea since it would be hard to get around and um there is a lot of space for roads .
So not a lot of people drive and trains would take them to places pretty first and it 's um useful for kids and adults .
So that 's why transporta - .
