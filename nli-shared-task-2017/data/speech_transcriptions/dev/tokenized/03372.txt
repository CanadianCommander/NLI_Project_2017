Well I guess the most efficient type of transportation in my country is probably train .
The reason why , and there are several reasons for that .
First of all they are reasonably fast and uh um also there is um that problem usually with bad weather .
So foggy conditions , or usually does not uh do not affect the uh the reliability of this kind of transportation .
Also it 's relatively um inexpensive if you compare cost with uh other kinds of transportation such as planes or private uh vehicles .
And last but not least is usually uh rather safe , is probably one of the safest ways of transportation .
