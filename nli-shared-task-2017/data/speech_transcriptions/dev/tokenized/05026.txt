I like to read novels to in my free time because the reasons are as following .
Um first because um when I was at college , I was a litera - litera - literature majored and uh I was required to read a lot of literally work in a novels .
And the second because novels are interesting to read .
They are , they have interesting plots , characters and they are good to read .
Uh for the last reason for me to like to read novels are that most of my friends like to read novels as well .
We can communicate with each other ve - very well .
