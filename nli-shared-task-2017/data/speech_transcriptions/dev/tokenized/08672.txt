Uh if my friends uh from another country uh came here to Colombia to visit me I will take them to the Atlantic coast , because , because I think is one of the most uh beautiful places uh that somebody from outside uh can visit .
Uh I will take them to Cartagena to and obviously to the , to the beaches because I think one of , of the most important things uh when you visit another country is to , to meet the place but also to take a , a rest .
Um after , after day , and a , and another important thing about the , the Atlantic coast is the food , it is fantastic .
So .
