A special opportunity that , that was given to me is that I got a scholarship from the Bill Gates , because I met all the requirements that Microsoft wanted , because of that I could afford to pay the expense minimum in the university , uh in the university .
Also , I could go to America , especially in New York to study uh uh study law which is my major .
In addition I would help my parents from financial difficulties whose annual salary are really low .
Uh for this reason uh I think this opportunity uh helped me a lot from uh giving chances and help us from , relieve us from financial difficulties .
