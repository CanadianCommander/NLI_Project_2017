A quality that a member of a team has to have uh for me and that is the most important is uh communication .
The leader need to communicate what he needs or what he wants to do , why ?
Because he needs to talk to members of the team and express what he thinks uh they should do as a team to accomplish their goals .
Uh other important part of the communication feature of a person is that they need to , to be able to the person politely and to say what they think uh in a manner , in a correct manner .
And then that 's it .
That 's what I think .
