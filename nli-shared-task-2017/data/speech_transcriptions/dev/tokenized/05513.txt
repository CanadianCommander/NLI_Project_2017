The opportunity that was given to me was uh Cape Town I had the opportunity to travel there and live there for one year , and that was from two thousand four to two thousand and six yeah .
I spent there one year and I attended a high school over there and what really impressed me is the countryside and um especially the people who live there , um it totally changed my attitudes and I had a different perspectives towards a lot of things like poverty and um the people 's minds and attitudes towards others because you could still see that some whites there .
