I consider as the hardest work ever achieved was preparation of an article that I submit to a conference when I was doing an internship uh .
Uh it was um , this , this um article was about the results of a research I achieved uh , uh after six months research and intense work to , to prepare the paper especially since English was not my native language .
Um I had to bring motivation for my work while I was uh maybe I did n't have enough experience to understand why uh all my uh research result could , could have been useful for the community and uh , therefore I find it very enriching exp - experience at the time .
