There was um woman who had a lot of money and she got killed by uh a person that uh at , at the beginning of the book we do n't know the person .
And uh after that um , um , respected king and try to figure out who did it .
And at the end of the book , um the wo - the person who did it was the woman 's daughter .
And I did n't really uh think that she would do it .
