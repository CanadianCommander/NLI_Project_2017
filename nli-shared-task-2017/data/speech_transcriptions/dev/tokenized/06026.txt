My accomplishment that was very important to me was my because it opens the gate for me to do whatever I want with my life , to go where I want , and to study what I would really wish to study .
It was um especially important to me because I did n't spend eleventh grade in Germany , I was actually in France .
And so a lot of people say it would be very hard for when I come back .
And I had to prove to myself and to everybody else that I could do it .
That was a great accomplishment because I got good results , I 'm very proud of my hard working .
And um , and the results I actually got on it .
So , so far this has been the biggest accomplishment and I hope to continue like this in future .
