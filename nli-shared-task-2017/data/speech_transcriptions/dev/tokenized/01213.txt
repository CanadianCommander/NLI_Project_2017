The most efficient type of transportation in my country is cars , is using the cars because Lebanon being a small country uh we can not uh afford to use planes .
We do n't have such uh large distances in which planes can be used and as well we can we can not use , for example uh bikes because uh it is it is not a long distance but it is not also a a short distance .
So the most efficient and the most relaxing method of transportation is , as I already mentioned , the the cars and the cars are most popular in Lebanon .
We can also use motorcycles .
