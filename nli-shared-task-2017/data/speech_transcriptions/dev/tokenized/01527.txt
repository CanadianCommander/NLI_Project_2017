I think that I 'm a very lucky person , in fact I 'm the big opportunity gave to me it is attend an high course of engineering in Milan , a very big city with a lot of work opportunity .
My father for example he could n't have the same opportunity because uh when he uh finished high level school he could n't go go university and got his graduation because his parents have no money to sustain him .
So I think that I 'm really lucky and with this course that I will attend in MIlan I could reach a good shop and a worthiness in my life .
