Friends coming from out of town or out of the country I 'll suggest uh two kinds of places for visiting .
First uh it will be some historical place so that they could find out the culture and traditions of the people living in , in this country .
And the second place would be I think for enjoyment because the fo - uh this , they came here for enjoyment in the first place .
So both of them are of uh good importance and I think they 'll have a great time if they visit of the both of the place but because both solve the same purpose as of satisfying the , the person who is out of the country in both ways .
Thank you .
