Communication skills is very important for me - , member in a team .

Uh it can help member to uh understand uh what he 's to do and his responsibility .
Uh when someone who do n't know uh how to communicate uh they will misunderstand or mi - , misinterpret the uh purpose of the team and therefore uh the team will be result in uh not good .
