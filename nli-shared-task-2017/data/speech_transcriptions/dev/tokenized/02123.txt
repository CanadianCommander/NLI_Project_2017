Is at the university , I had to start my masters degree and I was given the special opportunity to go to Thailand and to , um to make a watch quality assessment in a river close to Bangkok .
This was very special because I could go so far away and spend five months at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok .
There I could see how different the universities could be how different the Asian culture is to European culture .
And this was very important to me for my further career , and to my pers - personality , um .
