My um typical accomplishment was for me was when I graduated from school .
It was quite a task because I really wanted to go to university afterwards , so already two years in advance .
I started to work in groups to prepare for the final exams .
I um bought extra books and got some extra teachers to tell me all difficulties and to teach me other everything .
And I really did quite good , uh worked hard , was very disciplined and so in the end and it was not problem for me to reach my goal and here I 'm .
