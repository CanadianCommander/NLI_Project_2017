One of the , one of the special opportunities which was given to me was an intern-ship at a research centre , academic research centre and generally undergraduates were not allowed to become a part of the centre .
But thankfully I was allowed and that was a very good opportunity for my academic life and professional life .
And uh among the things that I found really helpful were that I was exposed to research the only people who are not exposed to research when they are in undergraduate , and I was also able to publish a lot of research papers well I suppose eventually helped me .
So yes an intern-ship really helped me and that was one of the special opportunities of my life .
