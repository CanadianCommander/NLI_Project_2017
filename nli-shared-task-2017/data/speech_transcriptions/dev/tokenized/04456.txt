I once worked as a baby sitter it was a use uh , a huge accomplishment because it had a great responsibility .
I had a huge responsibility by taking care of the kids I was the one responsible of taking care of their homeworks and um taking care of a sick baby that was between the two sisters that I was baby sitting .
The baby was sick and sometimes I could n't know , I could n't know how to act ` cause it was my first time to act towards .
