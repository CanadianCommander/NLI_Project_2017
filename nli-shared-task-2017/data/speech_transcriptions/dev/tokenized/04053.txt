Opportunity that was given to me was that I was able to go to the United States to do my civil service in Germany .
I learned a lot in the United States for example I learn my English language skill and I got pretty mature in this year to live far away from home , to live without your parents .
Another point is that I got to know new people , um special people , people with disabilities and I really like them , I did n't know they are so special .
That is about it .
