Um there is a big test after high school in our country , chooses which university we will go .
And I think uh an accomplishment that required me to work very hard was that test .
For , for two years in high school , I have to , I had to work very hard .
And so important for me because it , it chooses which university I want to go and I what I want to do in university .
Which uh whether I would go with scholarship or not .
So I did the test and I think I did well in that one and I will start university this fall .
