I live in Istanbul uh if my friends would come to visit Istanbul uh first of all , I will recommend them to see the Topkapi palace because you know uh there is some very historical background uh through the Ottoman history .
Because after the conquest of Istanbul and uh , uh they have built Topkapi palace .
And also the Bosphorus , Bosphorus uh has a very nice view uh and Dol - Dolmabahce Palace also uh after the late , uh after the late uh inc - inc - inc - increase of the power of uh the Ott - Ottoman empire they have build the palace .
So also it shows the last uh the last times of Ottoman empire in history .
