Going to spend time in my country I would definitely advise them to visit my home town , which is located in the West of Germany .
It 's surrounded by green hills and a beautiful with all buildings , historical buildings .
And every year there is , the so called SchÃ ¼ tzenfest , it 's a very famous festival there , which is very old .
I think three hundred year old and we celebrate every year and all the school children look forward because they participate in special parades .
And there is a huge amusement park and all , all , it last one week .
And people from all around the world who lived once came back , come back and just want to enjoy it and it 's really worth to visit .
