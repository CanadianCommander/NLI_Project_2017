My um best accomplishment uh was uh when I wanted to go to Australia , two years ago and I had to uh to pass some class and was the requirement from my uh , my school .
So the that is just to have new and um to , to pass every exam with uh , with uh a popular mark and uh especially in English and especially in most of the topics which are too important for my school .
So you had to work very hard during the semester because that is what you really wanted to have that so I will definitely work for that .
