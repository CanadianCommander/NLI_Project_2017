I think that in my country , the bus an efficient type of transportation is the bus because there are many many buses .
All the people might use the bus because they are too many and is more easy to pick on one .
The buses give you more easy ways to transporting people to the city , a big city from that little town in my country .
Make easier the process , also give you more facilities to pay because it 's more cheaper .
