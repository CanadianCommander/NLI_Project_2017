I would prefer to read uh magazines when I feel uh free when I have enough time for sparing for reading books because I I 'll go for magazines because there 's more information in that uh regarding general knowledge and I can improve my reading skills as well and I can uh know uh more more things about what had happened recently from uh some magazines like weekly magazines and monthly magazines .
Then uh and of course I can improve my uh vocabulary because uh those were prepared by high profiled uh tutors and I can gain more knowledge through that .
