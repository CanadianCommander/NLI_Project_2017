I was on a master course for piano playing and there I got to know professor Steinberg uh which is a pro - piano teacher .
And he gave me the opportunity to go to America and study with him maybe have an assistant or so I can um so I can pay the fees for the studies .
And this is a great possibility for me to uh develop my own piano playing my technique and everything and it is also a great opportunity to get to a foreign country um and learn about learn many things about uh another culture and how things work there in America .
