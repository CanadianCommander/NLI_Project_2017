The book I 've read is called uh The Da Vinci Code .
I think it 's uh , it 's an interesting book because um , it shows that 's actually the story took , takes place in Paris .
And it shows us some places in Paris I did n't even know .
And um I really like that book because of the monuments uh discovered through that book .
And because we do a lot about Paris history and about um the art that is on such museum like as um the Louvre museum or the museum .
So that 's one of the reason eI like the book .
And uh I enjoy the history also and it 's kind of um science fiction and so I like it .
