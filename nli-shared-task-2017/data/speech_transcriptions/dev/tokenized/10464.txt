In my country I think I think taxi is um the most efficient type of transportation .
We use will use , this is because um uh in my country um Egypt it 's very crowded , so it 's very hard to find uh a parking spot .
So using taxis will give you the probability that uh you will not have to park your car uh because the taxi will drive and uh just go away .
Um and it 's it 's uh very easy to find uh taxi in uh Cairo , they are a lot .
Um they we have we have a lot of taxi professional drivers so it 's the easiest thing .
