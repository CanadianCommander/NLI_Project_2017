In my personal opinion I think the train is the most efficient uh transportation system in my country .
First of all , it 's not so expensive like uh like driving the car and also you have no traffic you have no traffic jam and stuff like these .
So the train um the train system is very well in in my country and there are many routes uh to get from one city to another city .
And um also the Internet system where you can look about where the train goes is really good as well .
