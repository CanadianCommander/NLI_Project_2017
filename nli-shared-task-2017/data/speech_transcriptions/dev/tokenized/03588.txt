What I miss most about my home is when I go home and spend time with my family , that 's and that 's quite usual .
It 's a time when I get to spend a time with my family which I do n't usually get ` cause most of the time I spend my time at school .
And and I miss having a social time with my family .
I also miss playing on my computers , chatting with my friends , socialing in different place such as playing games together I miss and discussing homework , all kinds of stuffs .
But more and more , more over this I miss was my bed , is my bed .
