Out of novels , magazines and poetry , I I like to read magazines most mostly during my free time .
This is because the magazines provide information about what 's happening in the world .
They 're most informative and are more relevant to the current affairs uh of the uh country and the world in general .
They also provide information about uh the politics sports and uh uh entertainment scenario going on in the world and just provide a wide range of information which you can get in a very short time .
So magazines provide a very uh useful information in a very least complex form .
So I love to read magazines during my free time .
