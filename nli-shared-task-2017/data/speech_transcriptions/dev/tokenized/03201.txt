The book which I have read and found very interesting was Call to the Nation .
It was written by Swami Vivekananda .
And this book I particularly like because it 's very inspiring and it is uh it contains like from his uh call at uh Chicago 's uh Convention for Religions and his thoughts are very though - are very inspiring and I find them very appropriate .
Whenever I need any kind of moral boost I look into those uh these thoughts and apart from that it also contains life history of Swami Vivekananda and how he .
