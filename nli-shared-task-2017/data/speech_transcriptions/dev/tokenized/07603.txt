Recently I read uh Hermann Hesse 's Beneath the Wheel and it , it was very impressive to me because uh the , the prot - protagonist life and our life , I mean Korean middle-school students ' lives was very similar because , because uh middle-school , Korean middle-school limit uh Korean middle-school academic program is limited for the , for variety uh for like different students .
So we ca n't , we ca n't very , we ca - , we have to just study so it was very impressive .
