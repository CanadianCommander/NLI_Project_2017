What I miss most about my home , about home when I am , when I 'm away are definitely my mum and dad because you know , I 've grown up for twenty years with them and so they , they have a non , invaluable , invariable value for me .
Uh my brother too of course and especially the dishes that my mum prepares to me they are , they are simply unbelievable .
I ca n't find them anywhere else .
My friends with I like so much to go out with them anytime I can so when I 'm away I miss them so much too .
My dog , my puppy uh I 've had him for about seven or eight now and I like so much to play with him when I get some leisure time also .
