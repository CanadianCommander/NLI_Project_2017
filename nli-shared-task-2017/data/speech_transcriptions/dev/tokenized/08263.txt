The test to become uh lawyer is the what I 'm saying is very hard .
The reason is that uh in Taiwan the go through lawyer examination is quite low .
Is passmark is thirty percent , and the topics we have to prepare is quite extensive .
And it require day and days uh studying and you can add the tender book into the test .
So the regulation you have to remember is very large in amount .
Uh but however for lost .
