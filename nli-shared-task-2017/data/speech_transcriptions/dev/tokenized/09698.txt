I like to read um both fantasy books and magazines about political topics .
I like fantasy books very much because I can dream myself away from the daily life .
For example , The Lord of the Rings was a very good book that I enjoyed very much to read .
Um I can think about something else than then about the day uh when I have to school , I have I can think about dreams and fantasies .
And I like to read magazines because they 're interesting .
They show interesting things all over the world .
Interesting aspects of politics and history .
