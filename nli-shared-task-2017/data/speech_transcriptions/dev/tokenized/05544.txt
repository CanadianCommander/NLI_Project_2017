If I could have any job or career that I wanted uh I really wish I can be , I could be a consultant .
First of all the first reason is that uh the money you made in this kind of job is very big like you have a huge salary .
The second reason is really challenging , it is hard the competition is tough , and you have to really have to demonstrate that you are the best .
And the last point is uh there is the different picture will face and it is really interesting because it shakes to move from a mission to another .
So that is for these these reason that I really wanted to be a consultant in strategy .
