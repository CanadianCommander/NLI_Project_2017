Uh , the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of my home is the love and affection that our parents give me .
Uh whenever I used to have a problem , uh I used to go and talk to them .
They used to give me some reliable solutions and so that I could grow up on myself and I also miss the delicious food that mum , mum used to cook for me and uh I also miss my uh brothers and sisters with whom , with whom I used to enjoy a lot .
And uh the best part of the home is I used to um feel a lot of love secure and uh the end of the day I used to feel home uh wherever I am .
And uh that 's it .
