The book that I would like to talk about , uh an interesting book which I recently read is uh Catch Twenty Two .
Uh Catch Twenty Two is about the , it 's about war and uh the and uh the protagonist in the book uh Yossarian .
He talks abou - uh the rea - , uh he 's the reason I really found the book interesting is because of the way he thinks and his mentality towards not only the war but also to the people , other people involved in the war .
Uh that 's actually what really makes the book very interesting is the mentality of the people and the characters that are depicted in it .
Uh you know when you look at Yossarian and his roo - uh r - reaction to the roommates and people who actually wanna take part in the war , because people want to actively take part crazy et cetera .
