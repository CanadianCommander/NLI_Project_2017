Uh there are many qualities I could choose , however if I had to choose just one , I 'd have to say that the kindness to other members is a very important quality to be a member of a team .
I have some reasons for this .
To begin with , if my team mate is kind , our team , our teamwork must be improved .
In addition to that , if the member of us is very kind to us , we can feel relaxed and achieve and we can enjoy the , our work .
I think it 's because uh in three years ago , I was in the seminar in my university and my classmate .
