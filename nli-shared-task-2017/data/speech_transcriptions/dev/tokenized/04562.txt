If my friends come , my friend uh my country to visit and to spend the time in a country I will suggest to visit first Kyoto because I 'm from Kyoto .
And Kyoto has very , a lot of traditional place in here , many kind of temples and also the old buildings .
And the next I take her or he to Tokyo because there is the best , the most modern place and uh I think she will see go shopping and very interesting arts of building .
And uh it must be very fun to my friend .
