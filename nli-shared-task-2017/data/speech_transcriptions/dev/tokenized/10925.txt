I 'm from India and we have the largest railway network in the whole world .
I feel the most efficient type of transportation in our country is railways .
It is very efficient because it runs on time , it leaves on time , it does n't have traffic problems like normal transportation like buses or cars , and it is cheaper than the airplanes .
Airplanes are much costlier .
So , I feel railways are cheaper and more efficient , and it is at the comfort of another someone else is driving and you can sleep , you can you can stress around everything but in buses you ca n't do that because it 's it 's all crammed up .
Railways is a larger place larger .
It 's a bigger it 's a bigger transportation network .
