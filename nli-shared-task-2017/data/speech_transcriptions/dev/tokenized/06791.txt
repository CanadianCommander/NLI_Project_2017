The special opportunity which was given to me its the opportunity to study .
I think that uh very good one because there is too many people who can not afford to study and continue their studies from school chamber to the university and then for upper levels .
Uh I thank God for this opportunity because , because it was allow me to work locally or abroad and gain too many experience and so I can build my future and uh so realize all my dreams through the learning process .
