The most , the big thing that I miss about my home when I 'm away is the food .
I really like the way my mother cooks food , and I think it 's uh even better not just because of the way she cooks it , but also because of the way she serves it .
Now um when I am away like the way I when I go for a hospital uh when I go to stay in the hospital or a journey , I miss the good quality and nutritious food that she makes .
And I 've also had to eat very dirty food at times I 've seen cockroaches , and very oily and greasy food at times I 've had to eat that .
And that is something which I have not liked and that , and when in such situations I really miss my mother 's healthy food , and uh clean food , and um I long to go back home because of the way uh the food at home is something which I like .
