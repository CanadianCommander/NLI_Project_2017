My favorite reading material is uh is newspaper as and magazines .
Magazine because uh they mostly speak of one particular subject and for it 's own you can easily find a subject related to your portion .
For my part it is cinema and uh a lot of cinema magazines .
And I also like newspapers because newspapers often um often go further than the newspaper , so the news you hear on TV on a radio for example and you can find very detailed uh text about uh very varied uh topics .
And uh they will often related to history or a news of course .
