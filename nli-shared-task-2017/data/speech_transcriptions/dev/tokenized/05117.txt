People from another country , they are visiting mine to seen the capital city because it has a lot of beautiful hotels that you can visit and actually they not that expensive .
Uh restaurants where you can eat very fine cuisine and cheap prices and if you go to the outskirts of the city , we have beautiful sceneries .
We have beautiful places where you can see , where you can make a picnic , or you can go hiking in some not so big mountains .
And cross country in walking in the forest and lands that are in the outskirts because of the city .
So that 's why I think there should stay in the capital city of my country because it 's very beautiful and you can en - enjoy it without spending that much of money .
