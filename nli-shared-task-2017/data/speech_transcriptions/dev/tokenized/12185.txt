What I miss most about when I 'm home is my friends and my family .
Of course um it 's hard to , to have uh get together of course when you are away .
For example if you are abroad for a year , and uh with new communication is uh very good , so you can use computers with web cams and you can e-mail you can talk to each other .
And it feels better , you feel more home .
Uh well , actually I do n't miss home that much but that the things I miss but I guess one can deal with it .
