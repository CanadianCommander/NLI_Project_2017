I consider this opportunity as important or special because after completing my masters course it gave me some time to settle down before getting in the research program and in that time I came to know about what are the research activities taking place in the lab , in the lab and the industry .
And I can settle down myself in such a process , and such kind of process was taking place in labs or research place .
