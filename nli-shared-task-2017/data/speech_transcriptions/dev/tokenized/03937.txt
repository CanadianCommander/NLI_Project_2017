A valuable member of a team has to be very comprehensive in order to take right decisions in many boundaries .
Actually uh by being comprehensive he can understand all the problems that his team would have and uh manage to solve them correctly .
He would understand when uh few errors could occur and uh would know how to to solve them without uh many prejudice .
Uh moreover some people may take difficult situations and being more nice with them could help to to improve their work for later situations , so this is important quality that I think a manager would should have and they do have this quality generally .
