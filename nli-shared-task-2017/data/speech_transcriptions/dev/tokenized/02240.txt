If I could uh choose a job or career it would definitely be a biomedical engineer .
Uh ever since I was a student I always had a very large interest in engineering and how things work and I 've always had to take out my toys and put them back together correctly though .
Um furthermore , I also like biology and I 'm interested in the how the human body work .
So biology - biomedical engineering is a good combination of both my interests .
I get to work uh on machines that operate the human body , I get to study both the mechanics , electronic and biology and even get to perform operations uh with inventions or machines that I 'm able to use .
