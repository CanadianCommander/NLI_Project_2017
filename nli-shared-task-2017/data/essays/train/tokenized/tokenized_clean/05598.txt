i agree the question because the student to learn facts they understand ideas and concepts .idea is base to learn the facts .for example if i do nt know the concept i do nt understand the fact .perhaps for a limited facts i do nt know the concept but i know the facts but accoting to me this fact are very limited .since we study idea and the theory after we study the facts .another example is the gravity theory : newton since study all theory then he proposed the experiment and after he studied ena known the result of the him theory .there are o lot of example who they suppose my agree for the question .the concepts are very important they are interesting for the all facts .in conclusion before to study the facts all persons undertand ideas and concepts .
