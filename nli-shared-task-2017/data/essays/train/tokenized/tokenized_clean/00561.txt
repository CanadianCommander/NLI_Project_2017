with the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .consequently , few people nowadays think it is more vital for students to understand ideas and concerts .on the other hand , there still some people who think learn the facts is more important .in my point of view , whether to choose or not is not a critical matter , and personal preference should be respected .after consider my personality and the fondness .i will choose the latter one and list the reasons as follow .the first arguement that can be presented to develop my idea is that learning the facts may make students understand the ideas and concepts more easily .both common sense and our experience have informed us that learning fact may provide a more general and clear view .a good example could give some light to this point .as the students learning fact through the real example may give them a more specific and detail of the general idea of the thing .moreover , opposite example can be found to demonstrate that students understrand the ideas and concepts may not know how to use them into the real life , such as the learn the theory on the class and do not know how to use it into the real experience , so there is no meaning to learn it as students do not use it .in addition , it is easily obseved in modern soceity that learning the fact my be more effective .it is obvious that student studing by learning the fact may be more effective as they can get the general idea from the fact .to illustrative this there is an example that is very persuasive .students learning through facts which may more impress them than just let them understand the concepts , so they may learn it more effective and do not just learn the idea from the book , learn the facts are more interesting student to memonrise it .nevertheless , students understand ideas and concepts also have advantages to some extent , they can know the basic idea of the thing which may give them a direction to solve thing .however , such merit is speculative , what is more if you can see that not everyone can understand it deeply and use it .therefore , learning the facts is more important .in these circumstances , after close comparision between the learing the facts and understand ideas and concepts , it is not difficult to draw the conclution that it is crucial for students to learn the fact rather than understand ideas and concepts .
