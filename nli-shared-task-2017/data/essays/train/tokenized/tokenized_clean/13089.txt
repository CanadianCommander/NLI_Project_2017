i am disagree with the statement , and i do not believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than are there are today .in twenty years the world will look like very different than is today .in the future there will be more tecnological advantages and the companies will construct diferents types of transportations similar to the cars .for example , will be machines that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air , and everyone can have one , because the cost to manufacture will be lower .also the people want to go far away or faster , becasue their need will change over the time .altough this view of the future , there will be people that think in the enviorement , and the people will be prefers use the bicycle or other transportation that do nt cause a damage to the earth .if a can live in the future i think i will below the group that protect the enviorement , and i will prefer to have a clean air than a car .however , the perspective that i have of the future is a little negative , the industrie grow really quickly , and the technology helps in the development of the world , but also helps in the distruction .the wants and needs of the people changes , they want to have more electronic things for have an esier live .also the time will be preciose in the future , and they need to have a car to go to the jobs and meetings in a fast way .that is way , i believe that there will be more cars in the future .finally , if in the future will be more cars , i can help in the construction of this transportation , and that will be something that do not damage the world .i am an industrial designer , therefore , my work is create a positive perspective of the future and design positive things that help the needs of the people in the future .
