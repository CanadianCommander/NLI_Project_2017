i agree with the statement for the following three reasons :first : being young implies still long time to live .young people are always full of expectations and hopes because they know there is a lot to live for them , so they can make plans for the future and hope these plans will come true .older people have shorter expectations of life and for this reason they are not as hopefully as young people .second : young people have always more energies and a better healt .when people are young they can do a lot of things , for example playing sports , going to see new places , living far from home , going on long holidays , staying up all the night .they can do all of that because they never get tired and their healt helps them to recovery fast .when someone is old , for example , ca nt play sports because of his bad health and would be risky for him to go on holiday in certain places such as deserts or high mountains .the fear of dying caused by their bad healt and their age makes them act with more care and enjoy less the life .third : young people has nt seen many things yet .this give them the joy to live and to make new experiences .if they are very young they still have to fall in love and make a family .this two tasks make a young person more happy and full of hope .the idea of a family is very strong for young people and make them appreciate the life .an old person have already exerienced these things and ca nt enjoy life as a younger person would .furthermore it is not the same if they fall in love again , as it was the first time they did .for the previous three reasons i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
