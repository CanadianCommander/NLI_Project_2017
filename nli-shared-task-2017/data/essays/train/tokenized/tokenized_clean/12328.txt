in the modern era , where it is an era of technology and science , the upcoming young generation is faced with enormous challenge .they have to preserve their cultural , social roots and at the same time keep abreast with the latest technological developments to have a decent standing in the society .i personally feel , in between these challenges the young people nowadays do not have enough time for helping their communities .the first thing that comes to my mind , as a part of young generation is to get a good education , good job and be stable economically .in the modern compititive world , it has become so tough to keep up with this challenge that almost all of the time is eaten up concentrating on this single goal .a youngster in modern era , is most consumed with this challenge that he forgets his commitments to the community to where he belongs .if i consider my own example , i find myself guilty of the same thing , i am so much engrossed in my studies and thinking about future that i am not able to denote much time to the community .i personally want to devote time to help the community where i was born and brought up , and give something back to the society , but at the moment i think of that i find myself constrained by my socio-economic condition and the inability to do so .one of the major factors which i have noticed in the upcoming younger generation , is the loss of values and feeling of belonging to the community where they live in .they consider it just any other thing in their life , and are mainly concerned with their enjoyment and their life .as the facts in a lot of newspapers in india suggest , that a majority of upper class youngsters , who are not constrained economically and financially , prefer going to night clubs and parties to community helping , or tyring to help anyone in general .i do nt have to go much farther to find examples of such cases , if i look around my college , and students with not much financial constraints would at any time prefer to go to a club or a movie to enjoy rather then to help anyone .even in today s modern world , i do find some young people willing to take up the challange and improve the society which they are a part of .a very good example of this would be yfe ( youth for equality ) organization formed by university stuents , in delhi , india , to fight against the reservations in the educational system on the basis of caste , which was imposed by govt .of india .seeing their example , i am sure that some of the youths contribute to the society and country .the only concern is that such number of organizations and people are very less compared to the total number of youths in the country .if we look at the personal life of an average life on an youngster today , in most of the cases we will find that they are not very emotionally stable themselves .they are very much confused about what to do and what not to .in the modern generation , in most of the cases with both the parents working , the kids who form the young generation do not get to know their value system .in absense of guidance of their parents , they usually do not understand their responsibilities towards the society , country and moreover to humanity in general .i would conclude that , in general young people do not give enough time to help their communities , but the reasons for this are varying and are different for every young member of the modern society .for some people it might be the socio-economic constraints , for others it might be due to the loss of values .i firmly beleive if given the right direction and guidance , the young generation would realize that what they are missing on and definitely give more time to help their community , society , country and humanity .
