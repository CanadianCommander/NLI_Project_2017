i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing familiar things .in my opinion , successful people , especially in a business world , usually can imagine things that will happen in the future .they can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new things that may lead them to success .on the other hand , people who only do what they are familiar with do not have this kind of sight and ability to create things .to be a successful people , you have to be a pioneer to try new things .in the business world , `` time is money  .people do not only compete with others , they also fight for time .time is the factor that determines success or failure .therefore , trying new things is the key to success .people who do not take this kind of risks can never be success .they are just followers following the trend that the successful people created , which makes them always a few steps behind the successful people .risk taking is also an important part to achieve success .taking risk does not mean not caring about the probability to success .as i mentioned , successful people have the sight to see future things .the risk taking is based on what they see in the future .some people just do not have this kind of talent , if they do not think things over before taking a step , they will never be succeed .therefore , risk taking is blended with the ability to notice how the world is changing , not just taking risks randomly .based on my knowledge , i totally gree that the difference between successful people and the people that will never succeed are the gut and knowledge to try new things and take risks .those are the keys to success .
