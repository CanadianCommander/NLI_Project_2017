as i have to respond directly i d say i agree .but actually it s a bit more complicating to answer thios question .if i think a little about the statement i would say that younger people could and should enjoy there lives more .there are so mutch possibilities to have fun when you re young like sports friends and activities like that which we actually do nt use enough .i m saying this because when i look at my life it sometimes seems as it could have been much more fun and sometimes i can think of passages in my life where i probably did the best to have fun .when i think of the things i have to do and of those my parents have to there is a huge difference , especially when i get in mind my fathers day .he works so long hours five or six days a week so that when he comes home he has dinner , maybe takes out the dog for a walk and then goes to bed because he has to get up very early again .that s why i think our young lives are mcuh more fun and not so hard as adult s lives are .the main point of this is the free time we can spend also during the week after school is over .but often i think of especially this time and i look at what i m doing in the afternoon or what my friends do .i can see a lot of fun here when we do something together and when we go to sports clubs and so on , but on the other side i can also see a lot time wasted by computers , drinking and those useless things .probably there are children and maybe also youths who actually never or at least seldom do such things but even those who spend there time with this still have more great hours together then adults do .of course , there are advantages do be an adult , also when you look at the fun you have .if adults then after the lonk week have fun together this fun probably is `` much more fun  then our `` youth fun  and maybe it s weight is just the same as that one of working .
