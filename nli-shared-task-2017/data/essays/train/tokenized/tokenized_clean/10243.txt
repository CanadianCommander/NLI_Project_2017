is in a group led by a tour guide the best way to travel ?i think it is , because when you go to a new place , sometimes you do nt know the city well or you could take the risk to be missing .if you go to a new place , it would be better to be guided , so that if you have any doubt or any question , you will be sure that the guide will have the answer .you do not have to be concerned about knowing everything about the places , the building , the ways and you would only enjoy the trip .on the other hand , if you travel by yourself , without a guide , you must ask for some address or buildings name if you do not know it .it would take more time , it could be frustating and it could make you spend a lot of money on taxis , buying maps or getting back from wrong places .a tour guide is a person who knows the places that he or she is showing , and he or she would teach you some of history , because he would talk to you about the places you are visiting , its origin , its name , about what is it made of and all kind of things that would take a lot of time to learn .it is safer for a person to travel in a group and with a tour guide because they do not take the risk of visiting dangerous places .the tour guide would tell you what places are safer , at what time is better to be and the right moment .to travel in a grup could be better because you can learn from the other persons .if you do nt know the name of a specific building , another persond could know and tell it you .if somebody else does not know the history of a specific place and you do , you could teach him or teach her .it could be frustating to be in a foreign place and ton to know something that you want to .to be guided by a tour guide could have an expensive cost , but you have the security of a person who knows where to take you and this way you would only enjoy your time on learning .you can visit a place and not to learn anything about it , and it would be bad because that is the reason of why you are visiting that place , in order to learn more about it .a tour guide must have enough culture and knowledge so that he answer all your questions .
