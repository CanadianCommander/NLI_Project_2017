travelling can be a good or a bad experience .some people rather travel in group with a guide ledding them through attractions because it gives them more out of their trip .however , i am part of those who prefer to travel on their own .first of all , travelling with a tour guide do not give you the control of your trip .when you register for this type of trip , you have to agree that you do not have the choice to go or not at one site or to wake up early or not , because you have to follow the group .but if you plan your own trip you can decide which activity you will do or if at one point you are tired , you can relax and change your plan because you are the one in control of your schedule .secondly , guide does not necessarly like the same thing then you , so you might not enjoy some part of your trip because you have visited places that you did not like or did activity that you did not enjoy .travelling by your own , give you the chance to visit only things that you like or want to see , maybe you will end out not seeing as many sites or attractions as with the tour guide , but you might injoy more your trip .finnaly , if you are travelling with a guide you can not go as deep as you would have like in the exploration of a site or a city .the guide has to follow a schedule , so he or she can not spend too much time on one particular attraction .if you are in a group tour and you visit a museum , you might only have one or two hours to complete the tour .but what if you are a person who likes to spend full days in the museum , you might be dessapointed , rather than on your own , you can decide how long you want to stay at the museum .travelling with a tour guide can give a good opportunity to discover multiple places , but it would not be the type of trip i would enjoy due to the fact that i would not be in control of my personnal schedule during the trip .
