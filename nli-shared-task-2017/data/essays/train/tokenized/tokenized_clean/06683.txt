some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while others think it is better to focus on one specific subject .i do think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for two different reasons .first , students who study more than one academic subject are able to understand better the world around them .they will have a more open minded view .they will be able to talk with different types of people .however , it is important to notice that it is sometimes very hard to study two very different subjects at the same time .in addition , you are sometimes prevented by your college to pick up two subjects .it is why i do think that the idea of broad curriculum introduced in some universities is a very good one .last year , i studied law and was granted the right to pick up one subject of business .it was definitely a good thing because my business class helped me to underdand my commercial law class .second , in a lot of jobs nowadays , you need more than one qualification .for instance , one of my friend studied enginering and business at school .he is now the head of the selling division of an electric companies thanks to his double diploma .as far as my concerned , i work part time in a property developer company .this type of company is a perfect example of a job where you need the knowlege of many academic subjects such as enginering , business and law .you are faced with the writting of contracts ( law ) , the financing of operations ( business ) and sometimes a lot of problems related to the plans or the construction of the building .to conclude , it is very important to have a broad knowledge of many acaedmic subjects because of the different types of problems we will have to face .
