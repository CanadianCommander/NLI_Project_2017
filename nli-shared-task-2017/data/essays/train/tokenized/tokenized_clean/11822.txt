first and foremost let me try to put on the focus of the terms : in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i do believe that will be true .actually , in the future , in the earth , the level of pollution will be very great , the air will be bad and this for the car s pollution .even today in the big cities there is the problem of pollution because on the streets there are a big number of cars from the morning to the evening .the people use the cars to go to the work place , because is too far .a small number of workers , now , can go to work by tram or bus because the lines are too short and so they ca nt arrive with the public object at the final place .also , only few workers can go by bycicle because the street is too long .this only for the workers .the students , instead , can take the train , but this is always in late .so a boy or a girl goes by car .now i do an example that make my idea concrete : when i go to university , i m always in late because the train is in late ( everyday ) !!!if in the future , the government will decide to increase the train s lines , the tram s lines and the metro s lines , so that these will can arrive in time , more people will take these objects and not the cars .i hope that in the future the air will be less dirty than today ; i hope this also for my future children and for all kids .to conclude , i do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are now , or perhaps i hope this one .
