i agree with the statement for the following reasons .first , the public concern about environmental pollution has been increasing remarkably .because the problem of global warming by exhausted gus from car is one of the big problems at present , people can not help paying attention and trying to prevent the increase amount of the gas .for example , many people are sick because of air pollution by car and some abnormal conditions occur these days , for example insects which people only see in tropical countries are discovered in some countries .so , people rethink using their cars because car is one of the major cause of increasing the global warming .second , people realize the limit of oil production .nowadays , the skyrocketing oil price is one of the big problems in the world .because the japanese depend on imported oil for most of its energy , the increasing price influences directly public life expences .then , people can not taking public transportation such as bus and train to suppress their money .also , government faces the problem of global warming by exhausted gas from car .there is a law called kyoto protcol and some countries contribute together to stop this problem .and , media deals with frequently this problem .however , although this kind of law , not all countries , especially developped contries participate in this contribution .then , countries which have already been members of this law , make more effort to state the importance of the law and the need of their contibution in order to keep our planet clean as much as possible in the future .therefore , i think the statement is reasonable and we should do that .i think also that it is important for people to cultivate their mind which think seriously the global problem and contribute to deal wiht this matter .
