we should first agree on the definition of `` young people  .young people are those people who aged more than 15 years and below adult hood .in fact this represive a good percentage of our sociaties .that s why it is important to analyze such phenomenon .let us start with the first step , what are the problems they faced and may hinder their participation in communities development ?i think they have some major problems .first , their feeling of irresponsibliites and accountabliity .second , the cost of living these days .third , the initiativity level they have .four , governmental suport if available .five , thier self esteem and self identity .however , i think developing a questionnaire will be more helpful .do not foreget tp take into consideration the differances between various cultures .i mean , the differance between east and west and susequent religion .why this ?becasue both , clutrue and reliogn , has an important impact on the indiviual personalities and initiativity .here is an examples .when i was in jordan university , and in the tree day , the students council asked each faculty students  to clean the area beneath trees .all students responseded .the area was cleaned , the university director has a round to have alook .he was impressed a bout our work .this is done because the sudent council connect this matter to islamic religion , which encourage every one to clean his working area , his house and his community .take into consideration the support that we have from the university director .finally , how we can imporve youngs  particpation in these matters ?1 - create the initiativity .we should encourage them to participate .2 - ask other leader to be part of such activities .3 - connect such participation with various incintives .4 - learn and teach our sons and daugthers the importance of helping communities , and asked them , as a parents , to do that .we also should follow up them .our particpation will be very helpful .5 - this should be part of our education .
