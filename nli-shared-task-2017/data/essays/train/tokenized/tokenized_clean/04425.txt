i agree with the statement .today young people think only about themselves and their problems instead of giving time to helping their communities .they want only enjoy themselves having a lot of hobbies and going out with their friends .i know few young people who do activities for athey withdraw from the reality which sometimes is full of people that is sad and have phisical or economic problems .young people do nt want to see that there are persons who have to be helped and are near to them .but there are also a lot of associations that want to do something to help who is in a difficult condition .i think that everyone should care their communities because he is part of society and if he tries to change a bad reality he lives better too .young people should have more respect to others because they are the future and it should have to be better than the present .
