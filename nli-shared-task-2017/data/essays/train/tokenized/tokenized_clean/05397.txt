some people think that enjoying life is connected to the age of the people .they think , that young people would enjoy their life more than older people do .but do nt you need the experience of having been both , young and old , to make any statement about this view in an appropiate way ?i do nt believe that this statement is true , i think how enjoyable your life is , depends on other factors .iam 26 years old and from my point of view , since i was a child , or the time since i m conscience of myself , i never enjoyed my life so much , like i do now .when i was a child , the only interesting things in my life , where toys and sweets and going to the holidays maybe .maybe my life was easier , whithout the stress and depressing things of today , but their was nothing meaningful , special .i was not able to think in complex ways , did nt have any goals for my future , things that are of importance to me , like my university education , going abroad to study and so on .maybe my life is more complex and difficult today , but i m conscies about things , that means i enjoy important events more conscies , i make decisions more conscies and that makes my life more valueable .that makes me independent and free .and this increased more and more during my life , my life is getting more and more serious , which also means better .furthermore with getting older and `` wiser  i also know better , which things in life are more or less important .in the last years i learned to appreciate the importance of my family .i did nt know that i really do need them to support me not only in a financial way , but also with their love , since a few years ago .in a special age like in the twenties you see your parents as your enemies , you have to get older , to be aware of their value and importance for your life , to let them love you and give your love .i could see during my life , that things for me are getting more enjoyable , with increasing experiences .i believe that this will continue in this way and my life never will be not worth for living , or less enjoyable only because i m `` old  .
