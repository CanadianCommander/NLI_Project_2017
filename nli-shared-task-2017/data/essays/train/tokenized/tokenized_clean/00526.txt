humans tend to blame things , they often look for things that they can not see , but that does not help that much sometimes .`` advertisements make products seem much better than really are.  is a product of this action .it is also a popular but wrong opinion .first of all , if it is true why do not we act against it .if it is so then it is a lie or maybe a trap .well if they sell you a broken item what if the difference .there is no difference they sell you a different item than the one in the advertisement , therefore they can get sued .secondly , there is no point in fake advertising .if they sell a product that way they lose their credibility and that is way to bad .for example , a company sold 100000 units of a product with some fake advertisement , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more important than 100000 sales of the previous item .finally , if they can sell stuff that way why do they collect and replace their faulty product .it is like selling two items with half-price .for example , two years ago sony sold their new slim playstations with faulty adaptors but after they realized their mistake they changed every adaptor with the new ones .they did that because credibility matters and fake advertisements kill credibility .as a result all of that we can say advertisements do not show the products better than they really are because companies are afraid of losing credibility and getting sued .
