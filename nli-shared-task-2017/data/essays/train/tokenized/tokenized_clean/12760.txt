i sincerly can  t say if i totally agree or disagree with this statement and i  ll try to explain why .ideas and concepts are the base for a theory or a sociological movement , but if you don  t remember facts , date and names to expose in a discussion , how can you explain or make other people  s ideas changing ?in this statement there  s the same topic of difference between theory and experience .i am an engeneer , so i studied a lot of theory and was very important for me to understand concepts before learning facts .but as i saw in my life everything must pass thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lots of theories studied in the past .just think about newton  s discovery of gravity .if i should explain people how do work all the forces interested in that phenomenon it would take much more time than making an experiment of an object ( maybe an apple ! )falling down to the ground .surely now that i  ve practiced the theory i can better understand all the concepts behind the main idea .this scientific method i think it can be applied to every field of culture and maybe to lifestyles .i can bring another simple example of what i mean about the difficult to agree or disagree with that statement and the differences between learning facts and understanding concepts .in history there was a lot of important facts and if we don  t try to study and understand the psychology behind some characters of an event , we can  t surely have an our own opinion about it : so we see that are important the ideas .but if we don  t care about the timeline in which the facts happened we risk to lose the most important informations of `` when  , `` where  they happened !just think about the wars .are important thearies , ideals , and strategies as well as the dates in which the wars started and ended .
