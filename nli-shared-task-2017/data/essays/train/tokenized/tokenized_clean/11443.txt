i agree with the statement .i think that succes in these days has a lot of implications about money and carreer , but i thik that succes it s not just about these kind of things but about being the best human being that you can be .and because of this you ca nt really settle for what you think is ok .because in order to become more than what you are , you must realize that there are possilbilly other ways for doing things that you just have nt imagine .a successful person , it s an innovative one .successful people have been changing the world since humans appeared on it .you just have to think about the way we live now and the way people live two thousand years ago or more .and everything that we enjoy and give for granted , was somebody s idea .somebody that just wanted to do things a little different or just not like people told him o her thing are suppossed to be , but doing things in his o hers own way .innovation will lead to a successful live , as it makes our way of live a better one .ambition , will never let you settle with what you have or let you keep doing just what you think you do already well .ambition , may blind some people , and thus its has a negative connotation , but , the ambition that makes you always go forward to your next goal its also a very important element of success .taking risk its part of life , and peolple who have the determination to take them when it matters , usually are moved by the feeling that out there , there must be something better , something they deserve to have .so yes , i think that successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
