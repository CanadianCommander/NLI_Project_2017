some people claim that sucsesfull people are only working hard , while others like me fully agree that success dependts on trying and searching .the first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantages to work in a same way .one benefit of working in the same way is not becoming any risks .you wo nt fall down .for instance , my father who is a mechanical mechanical engineur .he worked 30 years for one company so became enough money and promitions .he started as a basic engineur and he became his promotions with his hard work .he had nt got any stress because the company does nt care him he cares only his work .undoubtedly , not taking risks means a healty , relax and safety life .though there are strong advantages to working in a same way there are some even more compelling advatages for me to work with risks .when you take risks the income will be more .for example , i m a mechanical engineur like my father but i want to have my own company so i can take more risks for making my company bigger .this risks will be enjoyable too because i like this style of life .more than that , i can learn a lot of things with my risks .the income will be always bigger with risks .in addition , without risks a person could nt be enough creative .with the help of the stress our body has got more adrenalin which means more creativity and better work .this is a biological truth and would make us successful .in conclusion , i fully advocate to taking risks will make someone more successful .everyone can work hard on a same thing but successfulness depends on creativity which is the result of risks .
