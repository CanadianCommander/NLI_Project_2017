students around the world have different methods of learning , it highly depends on the subject in hand .some subjects depend more on learning facts , other subjects are more towards understanding the ideas .i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and i think that this statement should be applied to all subjects .as a start , by understanding the ideas and concepts , students will end up understanding the subject in hand , not just learning it by heart .understanding the ideas and concepts will make it much easier for them to learn the details by heart .for instance , in biology , if you understand the exact route of blood from the heart to the organs , you will find it easier to later on learn the names of the organs that the blood passes through .moreover , some subjects such as mathematics , need clear understanding of the concepts so that you could apply them to the questions .after understanding the concepts , you can learn the rules , and then apply them .in addition , it is more easy to forget a subject that you simply learnt , but not quiet understood .in my junior high school years , my worst subject ever was history .i used to learn the facts , write them up in the final exam , leave the exam room already forgetting everything i had just wrote down .that is because i never bothered actually understanding the course .thus by understanding a course , you can remember it for a long time , and apply it in another courses afterwards .finally , you can understand more about a course by reading more knowledge than required about it .it might not be in the syllabus of the course , but it will help the student to expand his mind more and learn more than required about it , this would make the course seem more interesting .to sum up , by understanding the ideas and concepts rather than simply learning facts , it would be easier to learn and apply , it would be more interesting and you ll end up remembering the course for a long time .therefore , i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
