i do completely agree with this statement .in my opinion , necessities of higher education have changed tremendously in the past 50 years .as human knowledge exploded during this period of time , requirements for higher educations changed as well .today , because the amount of information available is so enormously big , nobody can be able to know everything any more .it has become more important to learn how to find facts at the moment they are required than in fact knowing them by heart .nearly all information is available at any place and any time on the internet , so the problem has changed from having a certain piece of information to finding it .schools and university can not teach all facts , even just in a small field , any more .they can , in my opinion , only supply an overview and basic knowledge on their field of studies .any further information is just to be found and immediately used when required .as everything becomes more intrepid and complicated , i find it important to develope a certain specialisation on a very particular , small field of knowledge to be successful .therefore , i need to understand basic ideas and concepts of all the concerns and issues , my subjects and job requires .but the factor that makes me really valueable for my employer , for example , is the individual , very precise knowledge i have on a certain field , which i can , of course , integrate in greater circumstances by my basic knowledge of the subject i m working on .this is why i think the statement is completely right .i would even go further and state that it gets also more important to individualise one s education independently , as i described above .private studies others than the ones offered at universities , schools and by employers will become as important as the classical ones considered as higher education .but for studying these , the understanding of ideas and concepts will be the main issue .
