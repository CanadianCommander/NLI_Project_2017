in the last 20 years the number of cars in use has increased a lot , thanks mainly to economic development and technology improvements .the car industry has , as consequence , improved a lot in terms of security and modern cars need less fuel than in the past .given the bigger uncertainty and instability that are today present in the world , both from the political side and the economic one , is not obvious what will be the future developments .there are many reasons to believe that the number of cars will decrease , especially in western europe and usa .for example , i think that the traffic and the pollution levels that have been reached in many modern cities will not sustainable in the longer term since they effect negatively the overall quality of life in most richer countries .in addition , the current trend of the cost of petrol makes the use of private cars everyday more expensive .in this context , a well organised public transportation service would solve these issues by reducing the usage of private cars .on the other hand , it is likely that economies of countries such as india , china and russia , will continue to grow at a sustained growth rate .this means that , expecially in india and china , where the population grows impressively fast , the number of cars will increase as well .the future of the car industry is another reason for which the number of car may not decrease in the next years .in fact , both in europe and in the usa the car indutry is a very big and important contributor to the countries wealth , because it employs a large number of people .it is fair to believe that governement will help these industries to maintain their importance to avoid any social crises .in conclusion , i think it is very difficult to predict what the future will be .too many uncertainties are present in our world today .i also think that a reduction of the number of cars , even if unlikely to happen soon , will strongly improve our quality of life .
