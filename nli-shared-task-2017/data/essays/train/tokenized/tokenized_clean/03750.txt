i agree and also disagree with the statement , i think that s up to the person if he or she prefer to have knowledge on many subjects or on just one .like the person who created this statement , some people prefer to have a lot of knowledge on many subjects because it might help them to have many work opportunities .however , to have broad knowledge on many subjects is a very hard task .i know many people that have knowledge on many subjects , but not a broad knowledge .those people i know have very little knowledge on many subjects .if one decides to study a lot of things , it would be ideal to study very hard .i agree on this part of the statement , that is great to know many things , but i do not agree that is better than to dedicate to an specific subject .i think that people who specify on one subject could also achieve many work opportunities , but must work harder than those who prefer to study many subjects , because for example , they have to focus on try to become the better candidate for a job .on my experience , i am a musician , and have decided to dedicate my life to music .i have to try and become one of the best musicians to gain a good job .i have to compete with many other musicians , great musicians , and must focus on being a better choice than others .so , like i said on the beginning of this essay , it s up to the person , to what the person likes , if he or she wants to have knowledge on one thing ; that s good , and if he or she wants to have nowledge on many things ; tha
