i agree with the given statement that modern adverstisements do not reflect the real quality of a product .since advertising is known it had the purpose to get the comsumers attention for a product , then cause interest for it which should end up in demand for the product and finally in the action of the buying process .so it is no wonder , that a company offering a product wants it to be presented in the most favourable way to raise the amount of people buying it .in only a very few cases the company and its advertising company care about the product shown as it is .from an economical point of view this behaviour seems apparently right , but from a moral point of view it is very debatable .a supporting role plays the development in the field of digitalization and technical progress .with contemporary techniques it is possible to refine pictures or movie clips by digital means .so in an advertisement for a lotion which proclaims clearer face skin , the picture of the campaign protagonist s face might have been enhanced digitally .so it seems , that the lotion is effective because he or she has very clean skin in his facial area .that the picture does not reflect the true situation the consumer will get to know after he has bought the product , when the adverstiser has reached his goal - a sale .in my opinioen this emphazises the nowadays problem that the population - the consumers - are not critical enough towards information they receive via television or media in general .they believe in what they see without a critical attitude to it .as a conclusion i want to say that from my point of view , its true that advertisements often make products seem better than they are , but thats okay because the advertiser acts in economical purpose .
