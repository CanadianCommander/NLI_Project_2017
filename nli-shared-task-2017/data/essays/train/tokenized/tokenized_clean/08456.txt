bill gates , the richest man in the world .what can we say about him ?he is revolutionary , imaginative and fearless .then people might ask what made him so rich and also the way to be one of the successful person in the world .the factor that successful people have is common is that they are fearless but love challanges .we tend to do what we already know how to do well .it does not give us any pressure and worries since we are expert in certain area .working on what we already know how to do might make us feel comfortable to deal with as it will likely take any risk but it might be really tedious as time goes by .by trying to do new things , people get excited with the feeling that we are starting something new that might motivates us .that can be the reason why some people like to try for something riskly and still happy even it they failed .trying new things may extend our ability and capacity .we can see how we improve by practicing and by pains in the beginning stage .by having mistakes and fails , we improve more and finally become experts on the area .this might extend our knowlede as well .repeating these precious experience , we learn lives and get wisdom .lastly , there are always some possibilities that the new thing that we are trying to start will bring double amount of profit .bill gates shows the successful case of it .it is obvious that he had had so much pressure and fears when he started his own business at the first time .as time goes by he got used to his work and acutally became the master of the computer .the accomplishment that he has done might have made the miserable memories of his life when he had just started the business memorable and precious .human s capacity and ability are unlimited .unlike robot , we can think and improve these thoughts .doing the same thing that we already know how to do can also done by robots .we are not robots therefore , we should be more fearless , imaginative and for when trying something new
