i agree to the opinion of need for having broad knowledge of many acadeic subject .reasons are as below .first , we usually experiece lots of situations and meet so many people everyday for whole life .to resolve problems from them and answer many questions , we need know various subjects regarding respective cases .in case of me , i am responsible for purchasing departsments in company .i should buy so many items used for various purpose .i must learn about equipment , energy , electricity , and so on .for each product purcahsed , i need specific information and study without stopping .second , one who have only studied the specfic subject can not think with creativity .academic subjects have somthing in common , but also differences .they can be exchanged between each other and improve themselves and invent new ones .for example , medical category meets music and can make new academic territory that make patients better with musical instrument or music .finally , the one with broad knowledge can enjoy his life .he can choose job and plan for life freely because he has basic competive skill for various categories .he have more possibility for his life than others .if one had many academic background , he could quit his current job and experience new works for life .ii did not take much times for changing because of his preparance .now , i dreams new world for future .for that , i restarted my study and try to broad my knowledges for various subject .it need my efforts and time , but deserve it .
