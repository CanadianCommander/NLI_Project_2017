it is common to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .for instance , it is obvious that young people party a lot more than older people , that s why they seem to enjoy life a lot more .but , if we take a closer look , is it really true ?i d tend to disagree with this well broad idea , and as far as i am concerned , i d say first that older people ceize the day a lot more than young people do , and then i d like to underline the fact that the age does nt matter , that it is the person s personality which lead him to enjoy life more or less .first , it seems obvious to me that older people enjoy life a lot more than younger people do , precisely because they have nothing to loose .they are conscious that they are going to die one day , therefore they are living in the present , they are enjoying every moment of their life .young people , on the opposite , are always making plans , thinking about what they want for their future and how they are going to obtain it .they consider themselves as immortal , thus they are not really enjoying the present time .older people experienced a lot of good and bad things and are now aware of what makes life worth living to them , consequently they are able to really enjoy their life .but above all , my opinion is that enjoying life is nt a matter of age .some people , no matter if they re young or old , will always live in the past , mourning about what happened to them , or spending time thinking about their good memories , and as a result , they will never enjoy life , the real life that s going on before their eyes .that s why i consider being able to enjoy life as a trait of personnality , which does nt depend on the age of the person but on its ability to be satisfied with what he has got .
