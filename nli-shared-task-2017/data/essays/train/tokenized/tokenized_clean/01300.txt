advertisments are very influental , they can form somebody s opinion about a certain product or even change an alreday fixed opinion .the bad thing about that is , that most often it makes products seem better than they really are .advertisment on tv or radio can show products from their best angle .if you look at food for example , how perfect a hamburger from mac donald s looks on tv .makes you feel hungry does nt it ?have you ever seen a hamburger look that nice in real life ?another example is the realty business , you can make a property , house or flat look really good on photos in magazines but if you would be able to see the house in reality it might not have a back wall !another point industries often make in advertisments , is the cheap prize , yellow shoes from humanic for example , are so much cheaper than the ones from clarks .that kind of advertisment tempts you to buy the product because of its low cost , but if you had never heard about the product you would never have needed it at all and could have saved all the money .companies manufacturing cosmetic articles , cremes for example , they state what kind of ingredients they add to make your wrinkles show less or even vanish in short time .but when you look at the laws that the cosmetic industry has to follow , something totally different is revealed .they are not allowed to use any ingredient that changes the context of the skin .so how is it the new anti-wrinkle creme supposed to work ?of course advertisment not only has bad points , it also shows you new things that have been invented and what product is the cheapest at the moment , but you have to think carefully before deciding what to buy , never believe everything that is said in the advertisments and always decide if you really need whatever is on sale .always take what is said in an advertisment about specific qualities of a product as a base knowledge but make enquiries and look in person at whatever you want to buy !a beautiful gold necklace might be made to fit your daughter s neck instead of yours !
