i am in complete agreement of the statement that its more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , due to several reasons .first , understanding of any concept or idea or one can say the concept behind the idea will ultimately lead to the `` fact  .at this stage students will be able to figure out the underlying principles behind the fact .in other words they will be able to understand the principle governing a fact .for example , if you throw anything upwards it will come down , this is a fact .now in other words we can define this phenomenon by first introducing the concept of gravitational force .moreover if add a little detail to the concept that if something is thrown at its certain velocity will not return to earth , it becomes more interesting .now at this stage the student has understanding of the concept fo gravitaion .he will be able to understand the rules guiding the fact and he would move one step further to understand that critical `` velocity  .this makes learning more fun and open doors for exploring ideas .secondly , learning only facts without their understanding will invoke sense of mugging .the students will not bother about the hidden principles and this will restrict their scope of education .in the general situation also we hardly bother about other routs to a destination if we have a shortcut , if it fullfils your requirement , even though its congested and polluted .so its a general human tendency .finally , if we limit our scope of knowledge then what would happen to the billions of books in the liberary ?isnt it worth thinking of ?access to the knowledge is a fundamental rite , limiting learning to facts only will definetely hamper in one or the other way of a persons fundamental rite .
