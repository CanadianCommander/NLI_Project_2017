i do not completely agree with this statement , because young people usually do not realize what they have and how short and quickly the youth is .young people are continually expecting something of extarordinary happens to make them happier , but without knowing nor themselves what this extraordinary means .have you ever red the colombre by dino buzzati ?it is a nice metaphor of young people searchign a chemere during his youth , which never is found , so that they can not taste the flavour of happyness during his flowerishing age .moreover , young people spend often their time doing nothing .i see these guys standing outiside bars , smoking , drinking , of course smiling , but without a serious purpose and so risking of getting bored .in other words , they waste their time .on the contrary older people , who have less life time ahead them , do not waste time , they appreciate all what they have .they do not wait for something special happens , they do not get angry for the boyfriend or girlfriend .older people appreciate the time passed and most of time are satisfied of what they have done during their life .they feel joy for the fact of having had children , who at their turn have had other children .older people , despite the young , have had in the most of cases a brillant job , or just a job , which has let them create a family , buy a house , go on holidays .they are fullfilled of their reached objects .as far as young people concerns , this is not always true .although young people have more life time ahead , it does not mean fewer worries .let us think of young people now : the problem of job , the problem of durable job , the worry of buying a their own house without a job ! ...concludind , enjoying life does not concern on what we are doing , but it relies on our expectations and what we managed to do before .
