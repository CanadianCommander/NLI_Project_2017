it is better to start with describing the successful people ; they have an unlimited brain , they do not think like normal peoples and they are capable to get used to new conditions .after this description it is not possible to disagree the ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing twhat they alredy know how to do well  idea .`taking risks makes money  and ` more risk = more money  is accepted ideas in economy and this idea forces successful people to go on doing something new .success is a sick , like using some illegal drugs , when you start overcoming some problems ( we call it success ) you need more to make yourself more successed .we can say it is not only making some money , it is trying to make ( earn )all money in the world .that is why succeed people trying to give self-cofidence to their children than teaching some specific formulas .successful people has an interesting risk management ability , at the same time this ability have made them successful .some unsuccessful people might be succeed , just one or two success are enough for them they can stop going ahead after creation is completed .we can call their success as luck .they know that it was their luck and they do not want to risk to loose everything they earned actually they can not do it .but really successful people , like in the statement , use their previous experience on next job and they know that they can do the next better .i absulately agree that successful people can not be limited or stopped with just several successes .also they agree that ` doing what they already know how to do well  will kill their successful minds .making more succes needs taking more risk idea is in their blood and these kind of people is not programmed to stop after a while .
