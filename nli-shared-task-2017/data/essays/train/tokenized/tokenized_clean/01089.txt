it is a common vue that advertising lies on the real quality of the product it aims to sell .actually , it has become one of the first goals set for most advertisements : to convince would mean to conceal .but the most important function that should , objectively thinking , be attributed to advertising is an informative role .we can think that advertising was born with this idea , that results in some way from the only consumer s interest : a society should inform its clients on its different products , so they are able to make a better choice .eventually , it would have occured that information turned into disinformation , because each society wants to get greater benefits by selling more and more .to appeal , advertising first plays on dreams and create new desires .but a radical step further is done when what just consisted in presenting the good aspects of a product becomes giving to it a wrong aspect .in fact , each human representation depends on desire : advertising turns an objective representation of the product into a subjective , desire dependent , representation , that allows the consumer to build a wrong image of the object .in that way , the product seems much better than it really is .for some particular products , we have an opposite process : the quality of the product comes from the advertisements .it is the case , for example , in fashion or for all luxury products .the client will buy that specific car or that specific perfume , just because he wants to be associated with the representation produced by the advertising .in that case , advertisements not only make products look better than they really are , but really improve the product and make him simply better .
