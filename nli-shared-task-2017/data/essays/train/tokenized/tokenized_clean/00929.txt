i strongly agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .tv , newspaper , internet , color and famous artist can be very tool for ads .first of all , tv and newspaper are very crucial tool for advertisements .for example we might watch tv at least one hour per day .this means that there is a possibility to see the ads on tv .they are just showing the products , we dont know anything about the quality of these things .they can hide everything on tv .secondly , internet is a very powerful for every kind of advertisements .for instance , i was looking for an apartments to live in usa when i was in turkey .every apartments looked to me great from their web page .when i came here , i checked the apartments that i saw ads from the internet .everything looks different .there was a noise on the floor while you are walking .we can see just a picture from the internet .we can not realize every properties of apartments from the advertisements .finally , advertisements are necessary for companies to sell their products .they would like to use different color and different famous person .every people might have a favorite color , so they can be attracted by products .for example green color may attract muslim people , red might attract communist people .they would not know about the quality of products .advertisements just gives us some idea about the physical appearance of products .we would not like to see every details of products from their pictures .
