it is a well-known fact that most people s purpose in life is to succeed , whether it be at the family , academic or working levels .now the question is whether or not we really need to exceed our current abilities to be considered a successful person .in this regard , i think that it would be particularly interesting and relevant to deal with the business world .on the one hand , i tend to think that an employee deserves the right to be considered as a successful person to the extent that they previously had to prove educated and motivated enough to meet the employer s requirements for a specific position within a company .as a matter of fact , given the level of selection regarding a position of teacher in macroeconomics , i argue that the status of successful person is not to be neglected .however , i want to highlight the fact that the applicant is all the more granted recognition in the way that their knowledge is not sufficient in these situations ; indeed , not only is the applicant s academic background important in the hiring process , but the ability to teach to a given category of students is also to be considered .on the other hand , i also think that we could consider the concept of being succesful from a different point of view .indeed , i also agree with the argument according to which successful people try new things and take risk .for instance , the latter qualities could enable people to evolve in a company ; why would we have to restrain ourselves while we could take advantage of external opportunities to improve in particular fields .as far as i am concerned , the only risk would be to fail .and it is a well-known fact that everyone learns from their past experiences and mistakes .as a conclusion , it is worth-mentioning that the definition of a successful person is subjective in so far as this concept implies to first define our current abilities and then our objectives in life .successfulness can be considered according to different levels .
