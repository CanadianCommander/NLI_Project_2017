i disagree with the points that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .some people more concentrated to the ideas and concepts when they learn about new things and they think learning is done , but there are most important facts what we learn about .for example , i just start to attend at a church and start learning about bible .if i just study about what god says and meaning of the word , i do nt think i can learn about god and what is more important , and also it will be difficult to have strong believeness .without learning facts just understaing the ieads and concepts are useless and after a certain time we will forget what what we was learning .for example , when we learn about our history , if we just concentrated the concepts and ideas in the subject , we never learn about our curture and our emotions .when we are reading a newspaper and if we just read about ideas , we can not see what is important effects or the facts what the article want to teach us or what is the reasons that this matter have to be in the newpaper .when we learn a second language in school , if we learn about just vocabulary and grammars in that language , we do not have good reasons to learn the language , we should be spaking to the other people in this language , that is most important fact that we should learn about new things .if we can not speak to other people in the language it is useless atas a results , learning about facts and understand the points is most important than just understanding ideas and concepts .
