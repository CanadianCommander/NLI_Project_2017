i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .rather , i am of the opinion that it is better to specialize in one subject than to have a broad overview of different academic subjects .having a broad knowledge would give an individual a superficial understanding of different topics which he may not be able to put to effective use for the society .specializing in a field gives greater insight into the particular field and an individual can explore further and create new wealth of information .this way he would be contributing to the society and the civilization .different academic subjects base themselves on different concepts and it would also consume more time of the individual in trying to get a grasp of the fundamentals of different academic subjects .we can draw water from a well only by selecting a right place and by continuing digging at that point rather than by starting digging at different locations .similarly , an individual would be more productive if he spends the same amount of time in exploring a single subject and specializing in it .a civilization needs new ideas to advance itself .looking at the collective , if everyone tries to gain a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we would all the sustaining only on the information wealth created already and there would not be any improvement in the status quo .to futher itself , the society has to have different individuals specializing in different subjects , exploring the new topics in their specialization and create or discover new information for futher generations .
