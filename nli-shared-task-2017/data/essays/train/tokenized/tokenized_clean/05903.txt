since the begining of life , poeple stood shoulder to shoulder in order to obtain and secure the primitive sources to survive .with thie time changes and eras follow years , the demand of helping and building up communities increased dramaticly .its not only helping to survive and getting food any more , its about being an active member to afford lexurity of life and improve a life style not only for the indivisual , but for the society as well .young people who obtain the right education and got rasied upon to certain manners are always awared for the fact that they have to contribute into the society in a potant way .they know that they have to give as thay have been given other wise the circle would not keep on going on .it is not hidden that the challenges in life are increasing more than before .it is also well known that with the high level of competetion the demand for more engagments is becoming a most on order to compete and survive .with this mad rush for being thursty for the autherity and the confusion politics create , time is becomine more valuable .time factor is being an issue .regardless of the fact that an indivisual wants to help or not , its still obveious having the time to do so is not as easy .a young indivisual does have alot of responsibilities and duties to do now .he has to attend an educational program , a job to perfom along with many other social bonds of which he has to fulfill .i believe those engagments youth are doing are part of helping the community .without an adequate education a guy would nt be able to obtain a good job .without those factors he would nt be able to start a good family with healthy well mannered kids .a guy who does nt attend family gatherings is totaly being out from the basic social life of which would affect him psychologicly and it would affect his over all performance .finally , i believe everyone is helping in his own way .we just have to make sure we are helping right .
