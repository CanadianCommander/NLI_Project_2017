in our modern society cars are used a lot and most of the people ca nt manage to live without them .i , however , agree with the statement and believe that cars will be less used in twenty years than they are today .on one hand it could be inferred that the number of cars will increase , because we have a very big car market nowadays .more beautiful and technological cars are offered every day and the people are drawn to buy them .furthermore , also young people are encouraged to buy them because this way they can feel independent and free .on the other hand , however , cars are beeing replaced more and more often by other means of transportation such as bycicles and motobycicles .in my native country , italy , cities are becoming very crowded and it is inconvinient to use a car , because of the traffic and the difficulty of finding a parking place .therefore people try to avoid picking up the car in the morning and prefer to use other means .there are a lot of transport services offered for people nowadays , even for those who live or work far away .metros , busus and trains are often used also because it costs less than buying a car .even though , the market tempts us to buy cars advertising and promoting them in the most various ways , i believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than nowadays .in fact , i noticed that the means of transportation and communication are getting better day by day , encouraging people not to use the car .it would be only a waste of time and money .additionally , people are becoming more sensitive in what concerns our environment : driving a car pollutes the air and ruins the place we are living in .
