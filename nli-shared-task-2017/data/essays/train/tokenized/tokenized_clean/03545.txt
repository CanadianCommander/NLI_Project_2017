the role of media and advertisements on our lives has always been an interesting topic for me .the pushing media plays a significant part in our decision giving process and consuming patterns .i strongly agree that most of the advertisements imposed to us effects our buying decisions and make the products seem better than they really are .first of all , the product advertised on several media channels mostly do not reflect its real physical appereance in terms of size , shape , or color .by the help of advancing technologies such as computer programs and new viewing technologies in creative sciences , it became so easy to make adjustments on the physical appereance of a product .as a result the product seems much more attracting to consumers on tv or newspaper .but when you go to buy the product you realize that it does not look as good as it was advertised additionally , in terms of quality what is promised by the firm is mostly not realized after the purchasing stage .it is easy to promise on ads rather than realizing it .for example in my country many home appliance firms which basically produce washing machines or refrigerators assure their customers that their goods will not be broken for three years .and if these goods are broken they guarantee affording the cost of fixation .in reality the item you buy generally breaks down in less than three years .worsely , when you email or phone them to transfer your complaint or dissatisfaction , it is a tiny possibility that you will get assistance .lastly firms are getting more wild on earning more profits because of the financial instability in the world .wars and economic crisis always fluctions in economy .therefore companies in order to strengthen their financial standing and improve their profit margin .they focus on advertisements to increase their sales .as a consequence new way of advertising enters into scene which is lying people about their products and pushing them to buy without hesitation .consequently i strongly agree that in todays world most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are since the advancing technology , ease of promising more and more and the financial status of the countries and firms .
