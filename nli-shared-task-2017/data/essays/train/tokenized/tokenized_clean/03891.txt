at first , we should make a definition of enjoyment .when poeple have a bad meaning of enjoyment , they numerate drinking , playing with trivial things and unrestricted acitivities .but i want to make a distinction between good meaning of enjoyment and bad meaning .i think that young people can be described as a progessing unit to become a sound personality .in this case of young people , enjoyment can be a good way to enhance their ability to become a adult .if person could not have a chance to learn the good way to enjoy himself , he would not know how to make his life meaningful with balance between enjoyment and temperance .the emphasis only on temperance can cause a stiff life and dry life style .to young people , the enjoyment means physical activities related with sports , travel , outdoor campaign .because young people usually hav much more energy than the old , they can show their desire to enjoy their life more apparently that the old .from this difference , some people think that youg people enjoy life that older people do .but it is based on the different way to show their taste , not the fundamental difference between the younger and the older .for example , as people get older , they realize that the outdoor activities are sometimes beyond thier physical capacitiy .this realization does not mean that the older give up their desire to enjoy their life .they want to find more comfortable ways to enjoy their leisure time as far as thier body condition can not be hurted .it will be very wiser for them to adjust their taste to situation .so , in the matter of visible level of the enjoyment , young people seem to enjoy life that older people do .the visible thing can not explain all of the enjoyment .if we apply the enjoyment to the very limited category , the old people who do a yoga for health in leisure time would fall into the categoy of patients who want to recover from disease .widening the meaning of enjoyment can be helpful for us to understand each other .enjoying their life according to their situation can not be blamed .the one thing that young people should keep in mind is that the enjoyment should be accompanied by temperance .usually , young people do not be equipped with temperance .they have less experience than the old .young people take a lesson from old generation .as time goes by , young people follow the way that the old had trodden .enjoying life is very important .making life rich and giving a room aside from busy job is a basic function of the enjoyment .
