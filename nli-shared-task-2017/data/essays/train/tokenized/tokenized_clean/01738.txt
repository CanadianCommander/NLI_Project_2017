in the oversea traveling , people can take a choice of being guided by tours in a group or go sightseeing individually .in my opinion , i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are more funs to travel in agroup , and tour guide guide the whole team in a suitable way by the experience leadership .first , tour guide have rich experience to plan the whole trip and guide the group in an apporiate ways .some tour guide can custom the trip that is most suitable for all the menbers under lots of constrinst such as limited time and money .second , a group of people can always be a helper or supporter for an other .we can take care others and it is more secure for all the members when go outside our hometown .whether there is some accident in the travel , members can take care your belongs and help you to call your family if it is neccesary .thirdly , it is always true that members are more enjoyable when share and experience the same happinesss in the travel .the whole environment is enhaced greatly .along the trip , member can reviews and shows some their intestests and experiences .from the sharing , i am sure you will understand others happiness from their talking .lastly , members understand others deeper through the making of consenus in the trip such as what kind of living place and what is target of the trip .learn how to respect others  opinions and find a critical balance between members  agreements .there maybe lots of disagreements here , sometime it is differicult make a balance or even conficts between the dicussions .however , i believe the situation can be improved by first understanding members  interest before the discussion and respect others  concert .in conclude , it is good to tarvel in a group with tour guide .
