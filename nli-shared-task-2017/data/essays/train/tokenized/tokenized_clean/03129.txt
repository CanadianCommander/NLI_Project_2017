i would agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .first of all if you learn to understand concepts it helps you to draw your own conclusions from it .which means that by understanding a concept the students are encouraged to think for themselves and maybe even question the concepts .this is very important to keep the students interested in the subject they are studying .another thing that is positive about understanding ideas or concepts is that you get a general idea about it whereas facts most of the time give you a specific information about something which does not let any room for imagination or own thoughts .in my opinion it is also easier to remember concepts once you understood them than it is to remember facts .facts are something that students keep in mind while they are talking about the related topic at school or universities .when they are finished talking about the topic they also forget most of the facts but somehow the ideas and concepts of it remain and students will remember them for a longer period of time .moreover it is the case that you can use most of the concepts that you managed to understand in real life , which means that they remain important even when you are not at school or university anymore .this is not the case with facts .as i already said they are linked to one specific topic and you can tell them to someone but they will not be of further use .the most persuading fact though is that if you forget some facts about something you can find them in text books or in the internet and you can read them again .it is different with concepts or ideas .it is very helpful to have someone to explain a concept or an idea so that you can fully understand it and once someone has explained it to you you can be sure that you understood it .whereas if you read a concept or and idea in the textbook most of the time it is not as easy to understand .as you can see i am really convinced that understanding ideas or concepts is much more important than learning facts .you could simply say that it is more of a long-term use and therefore more practical .
