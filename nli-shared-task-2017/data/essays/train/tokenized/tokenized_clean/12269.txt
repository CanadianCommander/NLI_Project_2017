nowadays , and as it is spread in the mass media , a popular misconception is that young people have a far more interesting life than olders .indeed , they make parties , they drink alcohol , contrary to the  old men  who spend their time playing cards , talking about business . ..i am deeply opposite to this vision .i consider first that there are a lot of different ways in order to  enjoying life  , then i would like to point out that young people have obligations too , and finally i want to highlight a substantial thing : it is olders , those who have the means to enjoy .but let s talk first about different leisures .to begin , i would like to say that enjoying is not necessary connected to parties .indeed , you can enjoy life in your work because you make an interesting job .for the sake of example , i think that a singer like michel sardou , or a business man , like steve jobbs , can have fun being at work .moreover , when you are older , you get experience which allows you to enjoy other things : a teenager can not understand the same things visiting a museum than a senior .and playing at trivial pursuit when you are 12 years old is not so pleasant .then , even if i can not deny that young people have usually more time for leisures , they have obligations too : for a lot of working people , they have finished when they come back to their houses .it is not the same for a student who has homework .and it is noticeable that adults chose their work , whether pupils and students are at school because it is an obligation .so , they can feel less involved in what they do .finally , we can not forget the fact that , for a lot of leisures , you have to pay to enjoy .speaking about sport , about cinema , even about attraction parcs , nothing is free .and in order to earn enough money , you have to spend a certain number of years , so you are older .to conclude , and being a student myself , i do not want to complain about my situation , and i know that my parents wo nt let me without money , but i do think that , with the age ( so with the experience and the money ) you can enjoy your life in a different way , without becoming a vegetable in a chair !
