a lot of my friends complain that their parents are too boring .they tell that their parents are not interested in enjoying their leisure times .moreover , older people wants that younger people enjopy their lives becausethey have already experienced a lot of enjoyments in their youth .therefore , older people encourage younger people to enjoy life .i agree definitely that young people enjoy life more than older people .young people are enthousiastic and vital to live an exciting life .they tend to use opportunities to travel ; and they want to experience different things .they want to know everything .furthermore , they tend to get quickly bored so they go to parties .and they dance and go to concerts .i am not different .in my free time , i like to meet my friends , go to restaurants , and more over .to enjoy life means for the youth that they can experiment and try different ways of life .in contrast , older people are now much slower than young people .they do not want to act more than it is necessary but i can understand this .i think when i get older i will become more inactive because i will have a family , one or two children .i will want that my children enjoy their lives .moreover , i will them give the possibilities , so that they can do more things .this is because i do not want that they say later that they could not feel happy with their lives .it would be terrible for me .it is interesting how young people combine a free happy leisure time with businees .they become even more successful because they are limited in their activities like older people .my friends are all perfect examples .a lot of them are succesful in their careers because they are happy and agile .enjoying life leads to satisfaction .therefore , i think , because older people stop to enjoy life they become more and more dissatisfied .there are two reasons for me why i think that young people enjoy their lives .one reason is that they want to see and experience everything .another reason is that they become more succesful with this attitude .now , i enjoy my life , too , but i know that this attitude will end in the future not only because of some changes in my life but also some changes in my attitude toward enjoying life .
