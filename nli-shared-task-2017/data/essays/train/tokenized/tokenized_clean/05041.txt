many people feel that most products seem much better than they really are .i strongly agree with this statement because as a customer i deeply feel how different the products on advertisement and in the reality .the purpose of advertisement is to attract our eyes .after customers are been attracted they will most likely to try and buy the prodcuts .when we look at the advertisement on the cosmic products , we will get an idea .most ladies love to have the same smooth and soft skin as the model on the tv so they spend a lot of money on it .the reality is , when we buy the products and use it for a while , the effect is not worth the price .the brand lancom is not really worth the price being charged in the store .some advertisement is pointed toward certain population .calcium , for example , is often being misunderstood by customer .it usually consume by the women and eldes , and they wish to have stronger bones .however , the calcium is being discribed as something has a magical power on the advertisement , so a famouse brand is much expensive than a regular brand .the reality is if you only take calcium without expose yourself under the sunshine , calcium has no affect on your body at all .the purpose of advertisement is simple but the expense is quite expensive .some companies spend a lot of money on the advertisement so they probrably will reduce the money they spend on the product .in some place , the company put old and new stuffings in their sweet dumplings , but they put on the advertisement is `` the most delicious and fresh treats  .in general , advertisement is a tool of the business guys to sell their product .a nice and attractive words and pictures are essential to them .however , as consumer , we realy need to pay attention to the money we spend and do not get fooled by the advertisement .
