evry one of us dreams of enjoying his life during all his living period untill his last day .but i personaly think that young people enjoy life more tha old people .fisrt young people have less responsiblities toward the familiy , so they have much more liberty to do what they want and to go wherever they perefer .they could enjoy their life by traveling or taking risk in some adventure , doing dangerous things or crazy things , while old people have their families and their responsibilities to take into account .young people also could go to some entertainment places with their mates such us pubs and diskotecs where there is so much noise that the old people could nt bear .there is also some nice places that are open exclusively for young people , old people are note permited to enter them .an other point to be mentioned it is the health issue , young people are generaly healthiest that old people , and this make them able to enjoy many things in life for example , lasting at night , playing some amazing sports like cars speed or jumping in mountains .they could also afford working hard and having an extra job to gain more money that help them to entertain them selves .they could also travel to any place without reservation because they are in good health so they could bear long trips , they do nt fear that the whether would be hot or cold , they could bear it anyway because they are still young and they have strong health .so i think young people enjoy life more than old people .
