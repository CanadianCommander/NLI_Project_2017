i completely agree to the statement that adversitements really make the product look different and much better than it acually is .this is just a mode of increasing the sale of that product .advertisements do highlight the advantages of the products but every coin has two sides and all that looks beautiful from outside is not always not so .they just exagerrate and present everything .lets not forget that people do beilieve these advertisements and end up loosening many times .some time back there was an advertisement about some new hair product on tv and i it seemed so attractive that i could nt help getting it .the results were nt very impressive .i ended up with falling of my hair and dandruff problem which i never had .one shoud nt just beleive in what is presented externally , it is nt what it is actually .yesterday only i saw that advertisement about the quiznos sub stating that what they offer is much more , not only this but they also degraded the products of another competent .i do nt think that any one has a right to do that .advertising your own product is acceptable but not degrading others .in my country the rules are different , people ca nt really do that .sometimes i really think that advertisement are just a mode for fooling people and nothing more , before buying anything at all one should find out the advantages and disadvantages both and than decide .dont just blindly believe in what is being presented .all that glitters is not gold .similarly all that lookes good is not always so .it is very easy to spend money but very diificult to earn .so dont just spend your hard money on these useless advertisement but think logically before you take a step .advertisements are helpful but not always .
