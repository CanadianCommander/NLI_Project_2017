young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .this can be because of their selfish behaviors or not having enough time to help but it is obvious that this is not a positive signal for the furutre of a community .when i was a student in a college , there were some students coming from villages .they were going back to their families as soon as the holdays begin , to help their work on farms or etc .even this situation sometimes had bad effects on their lessons , they had never thought not to help .now , when i compare with the new generation , unfortunately the scene is not seems to me so helpful and willing .they all say that , they do nt have enough time to help their parents even just for a few week during their summer holidays .the situation is similar for the public buses also .when i was a child , it was a pitty to sitting down when a pregnant lady or and old men is standing .but today , young people are rarely give their seats to the others .i think one of the reasons of this situation is depends on the changes of the games of children .it was more training having team games than today s personal computer games .team games are joyful as much as the personal games and also teaching children solving problems and living together .today s old people are the children of past s , and that s why , we know helping and sharing more than the new generation .whatever the reason is , none of the excuses are acceptable for me .becasue i believe that as the time changes , people are becoming to have more theirself-centered life style .
