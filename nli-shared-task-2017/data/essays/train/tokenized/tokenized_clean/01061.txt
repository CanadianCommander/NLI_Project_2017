it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there seems a lot of reseons , i think two reasons are the most resonable ; short of time due to studying and selfish minds .first , these days young people are usually students or rookies .they have to study and work all day long and even during weekens , so they can not pay attention to their commmunities .moreover their parents urge them only to make good grades in schoos and make a success in companies rather than mulling over the ploblems of societies or finding the ways to contribute to communities as members of the socities .second , the young people are being raised in affuluent circumstance these days .they are usually the only child or have just one sibling in their homes , so they do nt know the poverty or difficulties of others , and they don  t konw how to help others .almost all parents raised their chidren as `` price or princess  .accodigly , they are accustomed to be treated like that , which makes them have selfish minds .in short , as i mentioned above , lack of time to look around the societies and selfish minds make them not give enough time to helping their communities .
