i strongly agree this statement .i think sucessful people means people received reputation , money , status and so on for rewarding what they ve done good for the society .the things which society appreciates are something simply new or something which gives society new value or new perspective .so it has to be in some way new - no one else found the same way before .if i define sucess s meanig as above , people need to be brave to take risk to find `` new  . and i think only doing what they already know how to do well is not enought to find new .they might find something new by chance , but it is not enough to succeed .for examle , we can say wright brothers in europe , who are famous for invention of airplaine , `` successful people  .they are still remembered by people for what they ve done for so long time .they took a risk of dying by failing to fly and looking insane by doing something which nobody else had done before as a results , they found something new - how to fly by airplaine .this is the typical success by trying new things and taking risks .and i believe these attitudes are essential for anyone to be successful people .for another example , in our society , if we pick up someone who are well-known - bill gates , calros gone and so on .if we read the biography of them , it tells us how they found their way and received reputation .they do nt afraid to fail .even if they fail , they never give up and stick to their motivation to explore new things and never stop taking risks .history tells u
