as far as i am concered , a people , need not to say , should specialize in certain subjects for the sake of having living metold , however , i still take it for granted that people should have broad knowledge of many aspects .this will not only make a person more knowlegeable and wiser , but also make the person s life happier and more colorful .first and foremost , people will lead a more confortable and convenient life on condition that they have the knowledge of lots of different areas .for example , the people who has a basic knowledge of music , under certain circumstances such as pressure or saddness , will more likely to smooth their bad emotion eaiser than those people who do not ] : the people who are capable of playing some music instruments will tend to release themselves in playing some music works , which are entertaining and delightful , and few people will deny the efficiency of this kind of therapy .to sum up , wide knowlege will give us more ways to deal with some emotional problems .what is also worth noticing is that a person with lots of different knowledge tend to be much wiser than those who are constantly enclosed in a certain area .for instance , a people with a wider range of knowledge will have a strong ability to analyse the problems which bother them in everyday life if they have the concept of critical reasoning .this skill obviously will work wonder when people are contronted with a delimma , which forces them to make a choice , especially when it turns out to be relevant to a major event in one s life .consequently , a well-around person is seemingly more well-equiped for huge changes which are always accompanied us in every walk of life .finally , though people ought to be brilliant at some specific subjects in one s life , which is also of great importance to succeed in life , to be a person has the capacity of knowing lots of things also helps people a lot .if we are well-around person it is obvious that we will enjoy our life with ease and simutaneously stand more chances to succeed in future .
