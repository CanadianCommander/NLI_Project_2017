in our modern society , there is a lot of competition around the world .young people nowadays become very buzy .therefore i agree that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .due to the fast pace for development , young people have a lot of pressure on for their school .such as extra lessons , pressure cause them stay in the laborary study for whole night and sports time .everyday is fully occupied .take for example , at my school , all the students time is followed by the program that made by school .students really do not have time to do theri own things .after get to home will be very tired .normally they will take a relax .such as play computer game and listen to music .hence i personally think that young people really not give enough time to helping their communities .another factor is because that yong people become very selfish this days .they think helping theircommunities is not part of their business .they rather go for shopping in order to obtain their goods or stay at home play game , but not heping their communities .also , young people nowadays are very violent .seriously , so many people have aids or hiv this days .in instance , in south africa .due to the high rate of hiv and aids .people start to hate each other .try to destory other people s life .therefore i really think that young people do not help their communities .some young people might think that they have gave enough time to the communities .for example , in some school , school allowing young students to see the orphons .try to donate money to them .sometime they may sweeping the street for people .but unfortunately , this is very few school does that .from above , i can tell there are more reasons to support me that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
