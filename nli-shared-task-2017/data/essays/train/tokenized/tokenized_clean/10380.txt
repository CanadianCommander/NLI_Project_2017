lately a sharp increase in adverisment was sensed in every part of the us .the majority of advertisment are seen while watching televsion .you can not possibly watch a game or show without being intrupted by two dozens of commercials .indeed most advertisment make products seem much better than they really are .digital imaging and color enhancments has created products that does not exist .bussiness owners relay on the diversty of people out there , to sell their products .moreaver they use these fancy adevertisment to trap people into their stores .recent inovations in the world of imaging ; made everything possible .also the use of computers to enhance colors , and enhance the image or object ; made everything seem fake .for example my sister went out shopping for a dress she saw in a fancy catalog .she was stunned the real dress did not look anything like the picture in the catalog .another example might be the nice juciy sandwiches you see in the commercials ; but never get to see them in real life .simply becasue they are the invetntion of a camera and a cameraman .most businessmen relay on the diversty of people .you might not think that this is the product you  ve seen the other day .other individuals might think the opposite way .people are not the same ; and they precive things diffrently .other businessmen try to grab the attnetion of the costumers .for example ; i went to change my car s tiers .one store had this big sign `` 4 tiers for $ 99  .imediatly i step in ; however the associate informed me that this offer is not for the size i am looking for .a freind later told me that he used four diffrent cars , and he could not get the offer .
