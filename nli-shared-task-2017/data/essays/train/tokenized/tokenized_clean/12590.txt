i m agree with this statement because in the future there would be new types of transportation .i also think this because the the oil someday will finish , and the oil will be only for the rich .but let me explain my reasons point by point .the first point and the main one for me , is that cars are not very safety , even nowadays with the new intelligent cars .only in my country there are 45.000 deaths each year .this is a big number of deaths , so thats why i think there are a lot of people working in new types of transportation .and i imagine you asking your self why does this guy know that information , i know this information because in spain many families suffer the consecuences of this types of accidents .another important point is that the oil someday will finish , but i think we do nt have to wait until that day , i say this because in europe the price of the oil is very very expensive , many people ca nt pay it .as i read the other day in a prestigious newspaper there are a lot of companies working in alternative types of oil .this is something that i do nt know too much , so let keep it for the scientists .finally i wanna express my conclusion , and it s that one of the gratest inventions of the human bean in a few years will finish .i do nt want to look like a dramatic person but the only thing that cars give us are problems , for example many people suffer stress because the traffic jams .but on the other hand cars also help us now the trips are more shorter than before , but this is only a little advantege .there are more disadvanteges .
