it is realy difficult to say broadly that it is the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide , or to plan for your tour yourself .there are several factors contributing in making an opinion .if i am travelling to a new place that i did not visit before and have no experience or knowledge about its best places , timing , sight tours , historical places and recreational locations , then , of course , having it professionally arranged by a tourism company and being led by a guide will be the best option .this will save time and effort and in the same time will provide the best to see and to do in the place i am visiting .the trip will be professionally preplanned and i do nt have to worry about transportation or gathering information or going into the hassle of the unknown or unexpected .another good point is being a member in a tour group will give me an excellent opportunity to get in touch with other people from different backgrounds and be acquainted with other cultures .it is a golden chance to make new friendship relations and enjoy talking to people out of the usual circle of persons in my ordinary daily life .on the other hand , if i am travelling with my family or with a group of close friends and i know the place or country i am addressing , then i would prefer to go on my own in such trip .having visited that place , probably more than one time , means that i have the sufficient experience and knowledge as regards where to go , what to see or visit , and when to do this or that in the proposed program .in this case i may be the personal guide to my companions !i do prefer this last option in case i am travelling with my family to a place i know very well .it saves me money and gives me and my familiy the advantage of flexibility in planning and in keeping privacy .it also gives us the opportunity to strengthen or family bonds and enriches our relation to each other without being tied or perplexed with obligations to the rest of the tour group .
