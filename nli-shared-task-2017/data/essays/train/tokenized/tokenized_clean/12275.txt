in addressing whether younger people enjoy life more than older people , i can not state for certain .however , i think that enjoying life is not heavily dependent upon age , but rather on the different situations of each person .admittedly , young people seem to enjoy life more than older people on the outside .this is because younger people are more vibrant , adventurous , and have more energy .they have less responsibilities than older people , giving them more freedom to explore and have fun .but i can not rule out the burdens that i have experienced growing up .for example , the pressure of entering university , then graduating , and then acquiring a job .it seemed that overcoming a hill led to an even bigger mountain .however , i can not ignore the fact that as people grow older , they have achieved many things along the way .for example , a stable job , leisure time to do hobbies , birth and nuture of children are just some of the things that can lead to an enjoyable and fulfilling life .in addition , the period after retirement seems so liberating and enjoyable .but on the other hand , older people have more responsibilities , meaning less time to yourself to enjoy life .it seems that who enjoys life more , the younger or older , does not depend on age , but rather on how the individual grows up and becomes older .some people may think that their childhood was a disaster , without many good memories , while being at there happiest at an older age .on the other hand , some people may miss their childhood and wish that they could go back to the innocent days when they were free to do whatever they wanted .in conclusion , i do not fully agree with this statement , as questioning happiness based on age does not produce a reliable answer .rather happiness , whenever experienced depends on the individuals life
