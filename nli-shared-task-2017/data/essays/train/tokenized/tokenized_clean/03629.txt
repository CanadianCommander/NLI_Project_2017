an advertisement is the most important subject for selling products .if the advertisement of your product is very good and interesting than no matter how it seems because the people will keep on buying your product .i think that the advertisement has to be perfect so that you can sell your product with a good price .nowadays , people like to buy things which everyone has .no matter how they advertise it .if the product is not the same as they advertise than there is only one possibility is that , you will not buy it never again .producers make good products .the problem is costumers .if they ca nt advertise it very interesting and amazing however the people will not buy your product .they will buy the ones which sounds interesting and after if they do nt like it , you will have the change to sell your product .as an example , you are producing bags .the quality of the bag is very cheap and bad .paris hilton wore it for advertisement one day .there is another company which has the same price and with a good quality .would you buy the one which paris hilton wears or the one you have nt seen anybody wearing it ?the answer will be the one which paris hilton wore and bad quality .why ?because the advertisement is better than the other one and people never heard about your company .last but not least , everybody likes to buy good products but especially the one which is good advertised and look expensive and usefull .if they are not happy with your product , than you ca nt sell anything to them anymore .
