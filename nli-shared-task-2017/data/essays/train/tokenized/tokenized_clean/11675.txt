i knew what communication means , it means that i have conversation with others and i should listen to others when they speak .but sometimes i do nt listen to them , and just i talk to them what i want to say .i still confused what i should do when i communicate with others , even though i know what it is .i guess i do nt fully understand what is communication , but also i somehow misunderstand what it means .in my opinion , understanding idea is more important than what it is .i am pretty sure there are a lot of students like me .even though they know a lot of facts or definitions , they really do nt what it means for themselves .so very often students could misunderstand what it is .for exemple , even though i learn what is communication , i did nt try to understand that concept and i just admit this idea without thinking .after all , it leads me to misunderstand what communication is and i could nt use this concept very well in my life .i think all facts and definitions should be adapted to people .if one does nt mean anything to them , it is really nothing .it can become something when it is used by people and adapted for their life .i learned a lot of things when i was young , but i could nt remember all those , such as geology , biology , literature .however i still remember what i need for my life and my career .i still remember very well economics , math , english .it is because i need latter more than former , not because former is not important .if students find the meaning in what they learn , it is very helpful for their understanding .for these two reasons , i believe that understanding is more important than what it is .all people could learn what it is , but just some people could understand and use it for what they really need .
