i agree with that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .there are some reasons to surpport my opinion .first of all , think about the ordinary things .for example , as we all know , the water becomes a ice at the point of the temperture is 0 degree .this is a fact and it is common knowlegde .however , how can we understand the fact ?we understand the fact by knowing the ideas .almost people have taken the science class when they were in school and learnt about the temperture .they might have done some lab and seen the ideas of the fact .seeing the ideas is effective to understand the fact .secondly , in an advertising .i have learnt about marketing , and i realized that the fact is the only the fact , and i have to know the concept of an advertisment .i had nt known that the knowing the concept is very important to improve my skill of advertisment .i always tried to think about the concept of advertisments .even i did nt understnad the meaning of the advertisments , i could know the fact of the advertisments after i researched the concept of the advertisments .i then gradually became to be able to understand the fact of the advertisments .therefore , i needed to know the concept .this is helpful to creat the advertisment to me because i have to think the concept so i needed to learn about the concept .for these reason , i think students should understand ideas and concepts well .it will help them when they have to think about the fact .i also think that the fact is the only fact , it is not well-understanding if students do nt understand ideas and concepts .therefore , i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .
