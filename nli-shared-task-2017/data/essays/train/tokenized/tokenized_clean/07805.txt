i think that the greatest part of advertisements give an idea of the product that is not true .industries are only focused on their business , on money and for this reason they are able to do anything .in addition i would like to put in evidence the fact that sometimes annuncements are realized in a particular way aimed to provide not real characteristics or trying to hide other ones .clearly i belive that statments are developed only after a deep and long period of studying and reflection about which can be the better advertisement , the proper way of underlying something .moreover i belive that sometimes theese kind of statements do nt make sense .for example , some years ago my family decided to buy a new bike and we considered differents opportunities .after a few , we thought to have the just product for our needs .we watched that bike during a programme on tv .it was fantastic all of my family desired to have one of that incredible bicycle with that cool color .suddenly we decided to phone and we had to wait for two weeks .we were waiting anxiously , imagining what we could do with the new bike , when it arrived .immediately we tried it .i can not explain how much astoniced and alo worried we began we at the first curve my father broken the wheel .it was incredible but it happened .in that moment all of us realized why that bike was so cheap .from that moment i do nt belive in any kind of advertise since i ca nt see and test a product by my self .concluding i would like to suggest to every one to follow my advertisement , in this way we can oblige industries to realize true annuncement .
