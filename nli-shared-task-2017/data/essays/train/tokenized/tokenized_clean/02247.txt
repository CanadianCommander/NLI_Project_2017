the issue at hand to understanding the ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts .this issue is important because it is related to the student s life .i belive that the understanded ideas and concepts are the better option because it is useful in their furestudies , they look more confident in their subjects and they can do well in the exames .first , understand ideas and concepts are more important fir students is more preferable because students further studies is important .for example if the studen intrested to do the medicine if he doe nt undestand the concept and ideas of biology they ca nt studt medical school .understan ideas and concept .i think it is superior than learn facts .addionally , it is more important for student understand ideas and concepts is a better because when they look in the class is more confident in that subject .for instance , if i understand the concept of subject i can learn more subject and intrested to concentate more concepts .based on students to understand ideas and concepts are the better than the to learn facts .finally , i feel understand ideas and concepts is right one because we can write on the exams well .such as when i take the chemistry test concepts are very useful in the test .after finshing exxam i thougt if i do nt understand the concept i could nt write thw exam ultimately my choice is correct
