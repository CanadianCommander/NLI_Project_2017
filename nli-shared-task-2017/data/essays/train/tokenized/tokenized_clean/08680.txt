i think that young people enjoy life more than old people because young people have more energy , have more free time , and have less responsabilities .young people have more energy than old people , for example when i was very young i used to rock climb .when i used to climb i used to have a lot fun and enjoy the outdoors .i used to fell very happy , like a was free .now i can do it anymore because i do nt have the energy anymore my body does nt want to do it anymore .young people have more free time than old people , for instance they can do more things to enjoy their life .when i am in the park i see all the young teenegers talking to their friends and having a good time , in contrast i see the woman who have her littles kids runing around them .she is not having a good time , so the older you get the less time you have for yourself .i believe the young people have less reponsabilities for example they usually do nt have to pay bills , they do nt have to worry about going to work or how can i be more sucessfull .when you are young you just worry about where i am going this weekend ? .young people can just go to movies or stay home without having anything to worry about , but old people always have to think about something that they have to do .old people think to much before doing something that is way old people can enjoy every moment of their lives .i always heard from many people that best moments of their lives where went they where young .is like the firts kizz .in conclusion , young people can enjoy their life better because they have more energy to do what they like , they have more free time and they do nt have to many responsabilities .
