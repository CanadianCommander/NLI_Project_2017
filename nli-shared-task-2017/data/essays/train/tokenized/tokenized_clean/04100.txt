i clearly disagree with the following statement .i believe that the phenomena will be the opposit and that , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .the reasons supporting my opinion are the following :first , i think that population increase and the devevoppment of certain countries are two main factors that will make the number of cars raising .as we all know , population is increasing .in consequences , the number of people using a car will increase too .second point , the economic developpment of countries such as china or india will also represent a higher number of cars sold and used .in addition to that , i also believe that even polution problems will not stop the developpement of the cars industry .the reason why is because new energies such as gaz or solar energy are being developped .i think that people will be more and more concerned about environmental problems and will use these new energies .the last reason why i think the number of cars will be more important in 20 years is because people are more and more individualistic and are really exigent concerning their confort and freedom .so , they will prefer using their car instead of taking common transportation such as buses or subways .to conclude , i would say that cars industry is not going to lose importa
