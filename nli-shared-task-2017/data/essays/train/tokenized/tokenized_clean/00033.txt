i disagree with that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding facts .i think lerning fact is better than understanding ideas and concepts .first , understanding ideas and concepts might be difficult for some students .however , they would be able to guess what ideas and concepts are by lerning facts .only being lerned by someone does not make thier thought develop .thinking by themselves is best thing to halp their thoughts .second , even thogh understanding ideas and concepts is important , things do not always happen by follownig ideas and concepts .sometimes other results that students can not expect from the ideas and concepts which they understand may happen .yet understanding facts tell students that whan kinds of results would happen , and this makes them easier to understand things .third , some students might misunderstand these ideas and concepts , and they would make mistakes , but students who understand facts at first can get along things , because they already know what kind of things they have to be done .for these reasons i disagree this statement .
