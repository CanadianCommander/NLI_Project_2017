i think taking risk is a must in real life since we can not determine everything in our life .risks can lead people to earn much as well as to loose much .in fact people should consider on loosing something if they want to obtain a success .people can choose to keep on doing the things they have been already good at , but i think by that way people force themselves to be happy with the current situations rather than trying to find out something better .for example owner of a small pizza restaurant can earn enough money to look after the family and to afford the rent of a house and a small car .on the other hand if he chooses to extend his business , he can earn more money and he can use the money for the other things he want such as going on a holiday or buying a summer house .i am one of those people who takes risks .last summer i went berlin for my summer training in stead of performing it in my country .it was a risk because i did not know german , i had no friends in german also the company did not afford me a place to live .i believed that having a trainee in a such big company will help me soon since i would gain so much experience and also i would have the chance of working in an international company .it was really hard for me since i had have to live in a hostel for two months with little money and i had some difficulties in communicating people .consequently i converted that disadvantages to an advantage for me .the company made an announcement that they look for engineers that can be work in their istanbul office and i am the strongest candidate for that job now .to sum up there is no limit for upgrading the situations , but it is up to people at which level they stop to upgrade .also it is up to people always ask for more invest sometho  ing to h  get more
