genarelaising there are two different academic education approachs : one belives that is better to have a brite general knowlege in differens felds , the other thinks it is better to specialize in a specific domain .though both positions have good arguments i belive that it is better to specialize on one fiel .first we have to admit that if a student is accepted to a university he or her has be tought for around 12 years .thus the school schould have jet given a general culture , and had to present a panorama of the differents subjects .this is why the student how enter in the university normally has already choosen his field of interess , and applies for a specific preparation in a scientitic sector .secondary we schould not forget the obiective of univesity an of a student self is to create a proffessionist who is able to manage with his subject and eventually to reserch on it .who could be possible to work and reserch on different not related topics in differents subjects ?rarely have the human being the faculty to manage on an higt level competence and knowledges of many academical sectors .we normally citate leonardo da vinci as a exeptional genial inventor . ..but of course . .he is an exeption .to conclude we schould integrate the specialization in a well based background of genar knowledge .but at the univerisity in my opinion is better to achive the skills and to denvelope the knowlegdes in one specific subject , than cultivate many subjects which knowledge are not deep enought .
