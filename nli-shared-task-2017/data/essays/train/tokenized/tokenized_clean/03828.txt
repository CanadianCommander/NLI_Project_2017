some successful people try to do new things and take risks whereas others do nt .i can really understand these people who take risks , because everyone wants to make a bigger profit even if he or she already has a great income and additionally , life would be too boring if taking no risks and not making any changes .if i was the successful owner of , for example , a big medical company and i ve already had a lot of success and have made a good profit , why should i stop taking risks to earn much more money ?in my opinion , it would be the best to get my medical company to be the best medical company in the world .i and all of my employees would profit from that .we could , for instance , event a new medicine and would try to sell this product .and if it works well everything would be fine and if not nothing bad would happen , because i m already successful and i ve already earned enough money for me and my family .hence taking risks is not very hazardous for a successful person .in addition , if this successful person would nt take any risks anymore his life would be completely boring .i believe that everyone must love his or her job and should enjoy his or her job .but there would nt be any fun when taking no risks and the job of a successful person would be rather boring .considering me as the owner of a company , i could try to work on other fields or abroad , maybe even in another department .indeed , these changes are riskful , but thus my job would nt be boring anyway and it s probable that i would enjoy my job .another important aspect is that sometimes you need to take risks and make changes not only for your own advantage , but also for the advantage of others .i could , for instance , try to spend a lot of money of my imaginary company for medical research .actually , it s possible that i would spend that money of my company for nothing .but nevertheless , i have done the best , because i ve tried to help others who are ill and maybe also poor .i can afford spending all of that money , because i as the owner of the company would be rich and would nt suffer hard when wasting some money when trying to help others .in conclusion , i think that successful people should take risks , because otherwise their job would have been boring and they can also afford wasting money .
