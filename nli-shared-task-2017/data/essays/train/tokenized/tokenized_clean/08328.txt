in my opinion , young people definitely enjoy their life more than older people .there is no doubt that there is an old person who travels much more than young people .but generally it s not easy for them to just enjoy their life .i have 3 reasons to support my opinion .first of all , old people ca nt use their time and money or time for just themslves .normally old people have their kids and even grand kids .let s suppose a mom decided to go travelling to europe .she will absoulutely consider of her kids first .she ca nt leave her kids for a long time by themselves as a mom .even if she decided to go there with kids , the cost will be the way more expensive than what she goes alone .and also she might have a problem with making schedule which is hard to make a common break time between several people .then now she would start to consider about the plan of trip again .compared to this mom young people can go anywhere whenever they want to .although old person has no kids , it s still not easy to make leisure plan .if he/she wants to go fishing , they need to go for a walk to the lake and sometimes drive long distance or cross the mountain .then he/she should face on their limited health ability .even the time to wait for fish , he/she will feel tired .you would think that s a teeny tiny thing .but it infers to everything that they want to do .finally the old people is not willing to take risk .they enjoy to be stable statue which they do nt need to experience harsh happening .that makes them not to be able to do what the young people do .i m sure this fact is following to personality .but i think young people enjoy more .
