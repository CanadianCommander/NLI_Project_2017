today , the number of cars boght every year is staggering and the number keeps increasingyear on year .however , i believe that the number of cars has peaked and will definitely reduce in the near future .one of the major reasons for decline in the cars would be the affordibility .with ever rising oil prices and declinng reserves , it would be hard for many to own and run a car .although alternative fuels like solar and alchohol cars have been suggested they are still far from feasible .these technologies would take atelast two decades in implementing and can not offer any immediate solution .also there is lot of concern for pollution and traffic caused by the large number of cars on our streets .green activists are calling for special taxes on cars for polluting the environment .this forced goverments to enforce taxes on the car manufacturing companies .this would certainly reduce the interest of new car manufacturers .public transport facilities like buses and metros will gain wide acceptance not only because thay are much cheaper .but also because of the advancements in the technology , government and other organizations are able to provide commuters with comforts which are on par with the ones that cars provide .twenty years later there would be further improvement in the commuting technologies which would lead to reduced car users .lastly , there are technologies like segway and personal flying planes that are in prototype stage of testing .these inventions could replace the cars in the near future .in sum i believe that cars would be replaced by other forms of transport both for economical and environmetal issues .
