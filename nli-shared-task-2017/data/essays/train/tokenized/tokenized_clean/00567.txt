in my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people do , although both of them have their own unique ways of enjoyment .young people mostly spend their time away from home enjoying outside , whereas older people enjoy most of their time spendind at home itself .one reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outside during their young age .younger generations are involved with studying and career development , where most of their teenage is runs off .in contrast , older people must have either retired by then and so they can enjoy without any thinking for the future .moreover , responsibilities arrest the younger generations from enjoying their own life .this does not happen with older people as all their responsibilities might have been finished by then .for example , a younger person working has support his family finacially and should be responsible towards everyone in the family .so , most of his time has been spent in accomplishing his goals and supporting the family .older people enjoy more because of lack of obligations at their age .although , younger people pass their time with friends , they do only occasionally .first few years of teenage is spent in studying , after graduating jod search starts .later , work tensions builts up stressing in all aspects .so , there is hardly anytime left over for joy in life .in contrast , as the older people have already passed through these stages of life , they are absolutely free of such work pressures and hence enjoy their life to the maximum extent .another factor is money .older people are financially more strong than young people and so spend as much as they can because , they dont need to give explanation for the money they spent as do the young people .to conclude , older people enjoy more than the young people .
