a scene in which private cars disappeared , instead many mini and high-tech buses run and roar on streets seems like a complete science fiction ; but i believe this will come ture in twenty years , because too mush space is possesed by humans , huge clouds of dust and polluted air hanging on the sky , and new way of transportation is needed .currently , a huge number of buildings are under construction in our tiny city .we already felt that grass and plants for us were scared .however , facing big profit of constructing a new building , people wo nt stop building until we are run out of space .and that day will come sometime in twenty years .since there is only scared space , less cars will be on streets because there is no room for them !people will rather walk within short distance than drive cars .it is also to avoid traffic jam .since public area is too limited , public transportation such as bus and subway will replace private owned cars .with the growth of technology , buses in twenty years will be high-tech and of good quality .people will enjoy riding on bus more than we do today .choosing public transportation is also a way to save our endangering natural energies .most importantly , government will play a profound role in regulating the number of cars .as i stated , there is less and less space and energy in our globe ; thus , government of countries all over the world will take actions to reduce the number of cars .for example , increasing import tax can lead to a decline in car demand .also , government would awards family for not driving car but taking buses to encourage others not to drive .those actions may not benefit motor market , but will certainly help making a better environment .the global village is where everyone lives and has responsibility to protect .to make a better home for everyone , cars will be sacrificed .thus , there will be less cars .
