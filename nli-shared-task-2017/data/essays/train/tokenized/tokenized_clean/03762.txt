the best ?i do nt like say that .it meybe is the best way sometimes but not always .because we have some different ideas when we locate at the different age .so travling with a guide or not depends on the period of our age .if i was a child or teensage now , i d like to find a guide to describe the cultrue of some spots .the reason is that , i have much less knowledge about some famours places .so travled with a guide is very necessary for me to learn new things .also , traveling with a guide is a comfort way because i can save time and money to find the spots and buses which can lead me to the porpuse place .but , if i am a university student now , i will choose to travel myself .why ?because i have had the capable to do something on my own .for instance , if i want to go to yunnan , i will find some relative informations about that place from the internet .you know , in the morden world , internet is a perfect source for out younth .so traveling alone is much easier for us .so , do nt you think it is a good decision ?then , if i am a old lady who have had not ability to walk along .certainly , the best way to travel is led by a tour guide .the reason is that i can get some essensial sevice from the tour guide , such as helping me to walk , introducing some spots to me aloudly and so on .something look much foolish but are all necessary .because i am a disability one and need more heart kindly .so , traveling in a group and led by a guide depends on the concrete situations .but , traveling in a group is the best way to make friends who have the same interst with you .i have some friends who traveling with me to some spots , and i found that we all have the similar interests at some aspect .hence , leading by a guide is the best way to trave sometime , but not always .
