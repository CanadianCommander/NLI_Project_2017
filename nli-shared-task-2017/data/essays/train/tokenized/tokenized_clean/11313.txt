young people are actually the building blocks of the nation .they are the pillars on which a country stands .but , in this present world the people are not even having the time to stand and stare .i agree with the statement the young people are lacking the time to serve the communities .the youth is now busy with there education , preference for enjoyment and may also be due to lack of concern .education helps for the enlightment of the soul and mind .this governing principle of life is now imbibed in the mind s of the childern .right from the age of 5-6 years the children are busy with there curriculum .schooling , graduation and post graduation are considered important .even to get a good job or to settle in life these factors are given the priority by the young people .as such they are inclined in spending most of their time learning process .this is one of the reason why the students are not having time to help the society .young people always like to enjoy with their friends and go to the parties .the time left for them after studing is mostly spent in this way .they fell that it gives them pleasure and peace of mind by spending time in parties .for example i spent 14 hours at school and the tution .the remaining time i would enjoy with my friends .i feel this as a relief to my hectic schedule and routine life .sometimes it may so happen that young people are uncared for society .this may not always be the case but there are some instances in which this may happen .for example , i used to have a friend who always used to say that it is not our responsibilty to serve the community .if we are really intended to serve the society from the inner roots of our heart then we can definetely make a way .to conclude the young generation has the responsibility to serve the nation but not having the time to do so because of our own works such as education and our basic needs .but , let s find some time to serve our fellow beings and mankind on the whole by sacrificing our trifle desires .
