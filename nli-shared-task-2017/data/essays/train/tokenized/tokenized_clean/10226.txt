i dont agree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in any one subject .i feel both approaches have their own pros and cons .let us analyze the issue with some specific examples .students are asked to take up many diverse subjects so as to have a basic knowledge of all the disciplines .this is very important because no field works in isolation .the subject of geology or art is incomplete without the study of history .in fact the knowledge of one field is often required to solve problems in others .now imagine a scenario if the specialists doesnt have any knowledge of the other fields .how is a physics specialist going to solve his complex problem invoving mathematics if he doesnt have a broad knowledge maths as well .can he afford to go to the the mathematician every time he has some doubt with his maths ?that is not a feasible option .he has to develop an understanding of maths as a discipline so as to arrive at a comprehensive solution .we see many masters students majoring in more than one field .this is because their interdisciplinary knowledge will give them a comprehensive understanding of the problem .todays world is increasingly putting up problems which often require inter-disciplinary knowledge .the teams that work in the field of technology have a diverse compostion .they have specialists of technolonogy working in tandem with people who have a broad knowledge of different techonologies .as a specific example in software technology , many applications now require user interface in a technology different from the one used to do back end transactions .to make this work you need more than just two specialists of the two technologies involved .it is not going to work if each of them is totally unaware of the other technology .it will certainly help if they can get another member who knows a little bit of both .thus both approaches are required for a comprehensive understanding .
