do you have a child if you are married ?if you do , do you think which one is better ?the children is very smart .but , he does nt study at all because he really likes helping his communities .the other children is not smart .but , after all , he enters the company which is the most famous one in the world .if i have a child , i want him or her to focus on his work when they re suppose to study their own work .that is definitely true .therefore , young people should focus on their work .i have two reasons why this is very important for them .to begin with , young people have a duty of education .when i was young , one of my friends was very kind to everyone , even bad students .also , he was a member of community for the poor .we thought he would be great person in the future .however , it was just our thought .nowadays , he is have a hard time living his life with his parents because he has no job , even could nt go to the college .that means that we have to do our duty when we have a duty .if we do nt do our duty , someday it ll bring a bad situation to them like the above case .in addition , actually , young people are not suppose to have a extra time for their communities .it sounds very strict and miserable , however it is obviously true , espeically in south korea .i saw the article about it yesterday .they talked about most young people attend more than three institutes such as english , the piano , the madthmatics and etc .the interesting is that most of them have been going to be able to enter the best college .that s why most parent want their children to attend lots of private classes include regular class of school .finally , what do you think about my opinion ?i think that you ca nt agree with this .however , people should know about somehing like follow things .if a person did their work well when a person was young , someday this person will be success .then , they can help thieir communities and their society .that is not late because it will be already great job .thank you for reading / byunguk kim
