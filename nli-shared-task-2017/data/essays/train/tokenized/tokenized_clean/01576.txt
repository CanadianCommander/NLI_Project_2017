i agree .we continually see advertisements , the possibilities are too much for having the possibility to exercitate a real control .there are many kind of messages in every advertisement and when that is unconscious , we often do nt recognize it but we keep it in some ways in our mind .when we watch tv , when we read a newspaper or every kind of magazine , when we wait for a train in a station too , we see advertisements continually .all the cities have a lot of public sites where we can see advertisements .that is the cause of the our society is defined cosumistic and at the same time the advertisement and the advertisement products are accepted as a specific part of cutlure too .i mean , nowadays , the famous andy warhol campbell tomato soups  is a symbolic artistic example and above all , it is an aestetich kind of meaning vision .we live in a context in which advertisement is a foundamental part of life and for many reasons we feed this economic process .that-s the way it s easy to thimk we need some product , we idealize the effect that product could have in our everyday life and we think we must have it .the most products we use are not useful .sometimes we need some product to appear , to like to the people , other time we really need them but it happens very often , the product are very different from what we immagined in the advertisements and the effectes we hope the can make , do not appear in the reality .
