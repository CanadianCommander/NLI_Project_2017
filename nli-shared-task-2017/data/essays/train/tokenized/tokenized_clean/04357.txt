i agree with the statement argues that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , according to the general concept of advertisement and my own personal experience .first of all , the aim of advertisement is to sell those products they want to sell , therefore it should promote consumer s desire to buy those products .thus advertisment are nt suppose to make any negative impressions about products , since their aiming for celling them , not to make people refuse to buy .this is why most advertisements tries to make an effort to show products better than the actual product because they want to sell as much as possible .by using better pictures , catch copies , extra .for example about an exaggeration that i found in my personal experience , i bought a detergent that had a catch copy of `` never lefts dirt on your clothes  in its advetisement .i washed my clothes by using a laundry machine with that detergent although i later found out some dirty spots on my shirt .it had nt got cleaned off at all .i got so disappointed since i believed in that advetisement , although i can not accuse it .advertisments should nt be totally false but still consuremers should be aware that mainly they contain somewhat exaggerations , to show products better and make people buy .in addition advertisement is not a declaration towards the consumers , because we consumers have to judge whether we believe that advertisement or not .as i discussed , many advertisements include exaggeration about its product , therefoe i believe that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .in fact i wo nt accuse most advertisements even if they contain some exaggeration , because we know each companies  desire to make products popular .thus each consumers should have an good eye able to judge whether those products can satisfy their expectatations .
