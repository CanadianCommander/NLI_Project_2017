i agree with this sentence .the most important thing for a student is to understand how and why events happened respect to the singular fact .in other words , i think that students have to learn a method of working to analyse facts and phenomena .this is also the highest challenge for a teacher .for example , in molecular biology is more important to understand the sense of a step in a protocol respect to the concentration of each reagent in the same step .the concentrations of the reagent is written , it more important to know why you have to use that reagent .when a student has got a method ow work , presumibly he/she has a clear view of his/her work .the ideas and concept are something you will never forget .they give you style of work , in a logic manner .instead the fact are suitable to be forgotten .for example , i have forgotten a lot of specific dates of civil wars in italy during the centuries , but i know quite well the entire story .is not important the single fact , but the general structure of the subject .i m a biologist .when i do an experiment , i ask to myself : `` did i prepared the good conditions to obtain somethig interesting ?little things means a lot : tempereture , sterility , comfortable position to handle my instruments .this is the first step of a method of working .then a scientist must have clear the reason of every step of the experiment .even though mistakes are always possible , if one has a good method of working , clear ideas and concepts in its mind , he/she could discover soon the errors .
