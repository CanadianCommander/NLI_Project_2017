when people decide to increase their knowledge , they decide either to do this on one specific subject or the choose to extent their knowledge in different areas .in can be argued that in nowadays steady growing and changing industry a broad knowlegde is essential to adapt to the ever changing market .i am also a proponent of a broad knowledge of m academic subjects .firstly , business is changing at a rapid pace .numerous jobs that have been there for years , and have given labour to people are beeing subsecidiced by machines .for instance , if a worker only knows how to do a task that can now be done by a machine , the worker would probably loose his work , due to the fact that for most companies machienes are more efficient .what other job could he apply for if he only had the knowledge needed for one kind of labour .replacement of human labour force for machienes is something which happens frequently nowadays , due to the evolving technology .in fact , many people have reacted to this by extending their academic knowledge .this brings them the advantage , of easily adapting to chanching circumstances in the commercial world and they will less fear changes in their profession .secondly , i favor a broad knowledge because it it is less boring .specification can bring along boredom over a long term .for example , if someone has only one task to rely on , in order to keep him satisfied with his work and knowledge , he might get tired of the routine , ascribed to his work .he could not easily switch into another field , without educating himself all over again .he would might have to attend extra courses to learn about a new field of interest .if he had extented his knowledge to different subjects in his academic career , he would not need extra courses or even a new formation .to conclude , having a broad knowledges is more favourable to nowadazs market , its rapid changes and new innovations .furthermore , it is key to keep oneself satisfied in his or her labour life , since routine sometimes is a critical factor for unsatisfaction .
