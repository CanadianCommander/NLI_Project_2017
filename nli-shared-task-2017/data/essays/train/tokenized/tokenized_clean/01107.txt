i agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .most of the things , we enjoy require novelty , travelling and friends .while young , we have the physical strength to travel around places .old people travel little and that too making their travel as least streneous as possible .therefore , they avoid exploring new and difficult reaching places .travelling becomes much more enjoyeable when it involves physical activity and sports such as trekking , mountaineering etc , which old people are unable to enjoy .visiting places may not be as fun to old people because they already have so much experience and stand much higher chance of visiting the same place again .youngs , on the other hand , feel the excitement of visting a completely new place and environment never explored earlier .the normal lives of young is more dynamic as compared to that of the olds .there are always very special events such as the first date , marriage , first child , first job etc which keeps a young person lively .old people are more prone to illness and therefore restrict themselves to a safe and secure environment which keeps them restricted to small vicinity .old people in general tend to take little risk in whatever they do , for example , planning on-the-move trips .uncertainity adds another diminsion to entertainment , and since young can afford to take such risks they tend to enjoy themselves more than old people do .least but not the last , friends are very important element to enjoy life .young people usually tend to have a wider friend circle , since they meet much more people during thier daily routine during college , at office place , at clubs etc .however , old people mostly prefer to stay at home and therefore have a limited frind circle .old people have thier old friends but again due to limitation on frequent streneous travel they get o meet them rarely .so all in all we should try to enjoy as much as possible while we are young .we never know when we would become physically so weak that we may not be able to enjoy ourselves much .
