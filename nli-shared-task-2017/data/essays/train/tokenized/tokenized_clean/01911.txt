i would most certainly disagree with the statement that , young people of today do not give enough time to helping their communities .at first sight , it might appear so because of their comaprison with youth of previous generations .but the new problems have arisen and if examples of these are considered , the vision of the youth to helping and building their communities is clear and direct .the youth of today are marching forward in the realms of technical development and innovation but at the same time , not shying away from their responsibilities towards their community .working in the role of a software engineer in the growing it industry , along with my team at work , i have organised and participated in blood camp drives .we have also participated in sessions to spread awareness for the need of preservation of wildlife .we actively focus on issues at the local community level and try to bring them to the notice of the municipal administration .the youth has also been actively involved in issues of preservation of cultures .oragnisation of festivals and celebrating them with full enthusiasm is easily visible with the media attention it attracts along with the steadily increasing participation .tradition is what binds a community together and the youth has held onto this thread of distinctiveness .the world today today has moved from a set of local communities to a global village .the biggest threat to the entire world arises from the spread of hiv/aids .this generation has been completely receptive and also taken responsibility to eradicate this threat from the face of the earth .by spreading education about the reasons of its uncontrolled growth , the youth has shared responsibility with governments from world over , who have provided funds for the same .by fighting this as a world community , we will be able to eliminate this disease .the commitment and time by young people nowadays towards helping their communities has not dipped .the youth understands the responsibility laid down on its shoulders and promises not to disappoint anyone .
