in answer to the given question , i will first focus on the perspective of a prospective university student who is trying to decide on a field of study .should he rather follow his multifold interests or concentrate on one specific subject ?in recent years , many new , multi-disciplinary majors have been created at german universities , such as `` philosophy & economics  or `` cultural studies  , which incorporates studies in ecnomics , politics , law , language and regional culture .for a student faced with such a choice , i would always recommend to opt for one specific subject .i believe that multi-disciplinary studies can only convey a superficial knowledge of the various fields they cover .within the spectrum of his studies that usually last three years ( for a bachelor s degree ) , the student will study so many different issues that he/she is never given enough room to fully penetrate any of them .especially for students who have not yet decided on a specific career , studying various academic subjects all at once will confuse them rather than focus their thoughts .in contrast to this , a student who decides on one traditional field of study such as law or economics will at least have solid training in that specific field , which equips him/her for a pre-specified career .the student can then either follow this career or make a conscious decision to choose another path , rather than just being confused by a variety of rudimentary knowledge and not having learned to prioritize .to make my point clear , i believe that it is crucial to have a fundamental training in one specific academic subject .however , this does not imply that your academic thinking should be restricted to that field only .if the purpose of academic work is to find solutions to real-world problems , then it is absolutely necessary to incorporate different viewpoints into your reasoning because one discipline alone will never cover all aspects of an issue .in this sense , i would say that it is important to be apt in one specific subject in order to make profound statements , but other academic subjects should never be entirely neglected .
