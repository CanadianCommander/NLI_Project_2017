while some think that it is better to learn many academic subject , others believe that it is better to major in only one specific subject .i prefer the latter idea , specializing in one tipical subject , for three reasons .at first , i think that people who majored in one specific subject such as law and medics are able to earn a lot of money .for example , in japan , lawyer and doctor are high-classed professionals and can earn much money .to the contrary , people who do not have deep knowledge of specific subject can not earn a lot of money .to tell the truth , i am a officer of national tax agency in japan and possess broad knowledge about tax especially cooporate tax , so i can earn 100000 dollers per year owe to my knowledge .second , the reason why i prefer to specializing in one special subject is that students can enjoy their university life .if they learn a lot of academic subjects such as economics , history and mathematics , they have little time to use freely .on the other hand , students who study only one specific subject hard can possess a lot of time , so they can do sports or enjoy their academic life .thirdly , i think that students can be interesting in studying if they learn one academic subject hardly .in general , people tend to be interesting the subject as they study more hard and deeper .thus , i think that they will be taste the jo about studying .therefore , for these reasons i insist that it is better to study only one specific subject than to learn many academic subject .through my experiences , i enjoyed my college life and am be able to earn a lot of money because i studied only about tax .
