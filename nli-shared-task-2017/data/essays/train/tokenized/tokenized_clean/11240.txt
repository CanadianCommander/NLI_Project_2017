i totally agree with the statement .successful people try new things , take risks .because this is the only thing how they can keep their success going on .i do nt have big ego , but my friends and people around me say that i have been a successfull person so far .this is really nice to hear , but what really make people think i am successful .for example , i am an exchange student .i actually live in turkey .i crossed atlantic ocean and i came to the usa without my family or without my friends or without the places i used to see .this is really big risk .since you do nt really know what you might see and what might happen to you .new country means a new world and also a new enviroment .i know the life in turkey , but i felt that i had to see new lifes styles on the earth .let s talk about an old leader of a country : george washington .i do nt know g. washington very well , however i can say that he was pratically the founder of usa , he might have wanted to stay under the rules of britian , or be an empreror .but he took risk and he did what he believed in ( democracy ) .his ambitious was an independent america and he did it .how did we improve our technology ?god did nt give us everyting .we had to something .humanity had to explore and invent new things for a better life .if edison liked candle light and he was not curious about new things , would have we had light bulbs ?no , i do nt believe so .even tough we had , i am sure it would be later .he tried a new thing and actually he took risk against people who were disagree with him .he did not want to do what he already knew how to do well .and now , we can say that he was one of the most successful scientist ever in the world .how do you think that electricity was explored .thanks for franklin , his curiousity provided better life for us .i would not be able to write this essay on internet unless he tried new things .that was one of the thing which made him successful and unforgottable .to try new things could make you popular in your friend group .since every new and interesting thing you do will provide you good points .you might be seen as the crazy boy/girl .in fact , that makes you interesting person rather than successful person .for those reasons , if you want to be successful person , you should start to try new things and take risks .because what you already know is not enough .
