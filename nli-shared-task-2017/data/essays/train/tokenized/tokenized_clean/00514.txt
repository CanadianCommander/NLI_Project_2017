i agree with this statement that said `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreary know how to do well .the reason because i agree with this statement is this .if successful people only do whatever they know very well , we will have around the world the same things .for example , cars , if the people who are encharge to biuld new models of cars , and they do not try to do something new , how boring , we do not have a lot of options , but because they take risks we have a numerous options when we are looking for a car , you , me , everybody can buy all kind such as : a bmw , a jaguard , a camry , a jeep , etc .as well people who want to start a new restaurant , the want to oppend something new .if in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some chiness , greek , or text mexican food , but they do not have a real mexican food , i think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area .another example is fashion , women love fashion , they do not use the same clouth , they changed almost the 365 days during the years .the new disainers are fightting each other in order to have the best disign , they are risking , but if he or she disign is the best , they will get a good income .if you do not risk , i almost sure , you wo nt win .take a risk and you will be successful in life .in life we need to risk most of the time .you make risk when you want to change to another job because you can get better salary , but who knows that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to another city , it is risky but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the only thing you need is trust in yourself .
