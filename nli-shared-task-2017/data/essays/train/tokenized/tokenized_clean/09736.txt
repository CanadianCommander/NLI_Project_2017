i agree with the statement that successful people should try the new things even it will take risks .as the discuss below : first of all , it is true that successful people have already had their own bussiness , and if they still engage the same bussiness , they can do them very well .but we can not ignore the extra income of the other opportunities .it likes why some famous companies will renew their goods again and again .because they know if they can creat the new goods which are better and can be accept by the clients , it will feedback much more profites than before .so consider about these , those worries on risks are not very important .further more , every new taste for those successful people is means a new task in their lives .for instance , bill gates , the ceo of microsoft , is very famous for his adventuresome behavior .at first he creat the system of personal computer-dos and windows .after that , he turn his sight to the interenet surfing tool-ie .maybe someone will hold their view for bill gates , but no one can ignore his ways of thinking .at last , the value of one person also depend on the result of his career .many successful people have many different kinds of careers .those different kinds of careers was not build by one day or one time .these people also do them one by one .and in the end , they catch their goals one by one , just like some famous scientists , newton , aistance and aidicent .to sum up , successful people should try new things , that is why human beings can develope very quickly .because under every risk , it will give back more valuable things in the furture .
