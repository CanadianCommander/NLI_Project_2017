with the decision of the governor of california to sue the biggest car-makers , the burning issue of the environmental effects of car driving seems to occupy once again the front of the political stage .but this question is not a new one .indeed , for many years now , we have seen the environmentalists to support the idea that we will no longer make an extensive use of ours cars if we want to secure the future of our planet .however , on the other hand , the petroleum and car-makers lobbyists try to explain us that we do not have any other altenative right now .to my mind i think ( or perhaps i hope ) that the number of what we called today cars will experience an important decrease while in the same time another kind of  car  will emerge .indeed , with the rise of the new giants in the world economy i think that we will no have the choice to adapt our everyday life to environmental constraints or not .the reason here is simple : these new world champions are currently trying to narrow the gap between the occidental standards of living and their standards of living .this implies that they will adopt the same means of transportation than in occidental countries .in other words they would want to have one car per person .and we obviously know that this is impossible because the environmental damages would be so huge that it will but in danger humanity as a whole .but as far as i am concerned , i do not want to believe that we will slowly continue to destroy our planet without doing anything .i prefer rather to think that , like in the past , we are going to adapt to this new situation and that the human creativity will help us to find a solution .and this solution will probably be the creation of a new kind of car , a pollution-free one .precisely , if we took attention to what currently happens in the car-making industry we can see some evidences that this prediction will occurs .effectively , we can already see some cars which are fueled with both gasoline and colza which accounts for more than twenty percent of the cars which are currently in use in brazil .moreover , it also exists some engines which are runned by hydrogen or electricity instead of fuel .to put it in a nutshell i definitely prefer to think that human being will succeed in creating a pollution-free way of transportation , the  new cars  , rather than to think that we will all disappear because of our
