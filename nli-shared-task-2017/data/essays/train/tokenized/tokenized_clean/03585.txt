although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting , i really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons .firstly , if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge , because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field .moreover , specialization is very important when you are a job seeker , particullarly when you are looking for your first job .there is not any chance for people knowing many things in a superficial view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field .i can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes , for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff .but that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large companies .thus , the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself .usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert .we can consider also this dilemma is the history .if the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one , it would have been impossible such a fantastic development .in summary , although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes , society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenges that we are facing , and for that the specialization must be a priority .
