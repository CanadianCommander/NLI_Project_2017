do young people just worry about their life and academic courses , and not worry about the society ?are young people so selfish that they can not contribute just a little bit of their time to the society they live in ?how about all the homeless people who have nowhere to go ?what about the old beggars who do not have money to support their family ?even as young people , we do help our communities by creating clubs such as unicef , and cleaning up places for a better environment .in my school just a year ago , a teacher , ms. levine , started an organization called unicef .it is an organization where we help the children that need help .mostly , the children who need help are the ones who have no place to stay , no money to support medication , or no proper education .when this club was introduced , a lot of young people joined , not because they could get community service credits , but because they could actually help by devoting their time to it .just by dedicating time to provide service , we could raise money to save a child from neumonia or starvation , and that s what s most important .the environment , a place where we re all affected , is gradually polluting the place .every year , the school decides to take students to the beach to clear up glass pieces , plastic bags that are polluting the environment .the students who joins this event every year did not join because they could ditch one day of class , because the event is on a saturday .the young students are willing to give up their weekend to stay under the boiling sun and clean up in the beach and make the world a better place .time is unlimited .young people have time for themselves , but they would also find time to help the community .if not , they would nt be willing to go to the beach on a saturday morning to clean up , nor would they join unicef to help children who have no affiliation with them .most young people would actually enjoy helping the community rather than take it as a threat .
