i agree with this statement the importance of understanding ideas and concepts than learning facts .why do we learn ?what is the purpose of learn ?in my opinien , it is to develop from learning and to make advance .throughout several exemples will define the reason of importance of understanding ideas and concepts .business marketing is can be another exemple .before i learned marketing in the school and i have got good grade that time because i could well memorize everything learned in the class .however when i had internship in the five star hotel marketing department i was embarassed , because before i did not understanding marketing concepts and ideas in ths subject i forgot almost knowledge before i acquired .after that happening i read marketing book and tried to understand and applied in real marketing situation .through the process understanding ideas and concepts i could develope the marketing plan and apply marketin theories with modification the company situation .there is another exemple with development of science , we learn sience in the school but if we just learn that it does not mean anything .all facts in the textbook are like about history of sience .with just the knowledge what can we do ?however , through understanding the consept and ideas , we have some quriosities and exemin that we have developed science .acient people belived the earth is plat however some sientist understand and the ideas about that was not true they could find the fact eathis round .those tw exemples support the reason of agreement with this statement .
