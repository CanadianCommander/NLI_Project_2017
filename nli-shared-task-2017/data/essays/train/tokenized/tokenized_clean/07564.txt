marketing successit is not uncommon to hear or read opinions regarding products and how they are not what they were expected to be .this is partially the fault of marketing and their advertisements , since what they do is create a perception of a product that may not be totally true in reality .this is why i agree with the statement presented , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ..a product can be anything from an idea , to something we consume .marketing s objective is to increase acceptance of a product by using schemes to create a necessity and convince the end users to obtain that certain service , product , or idea .it gets interesting when the `` acceptance  translates into sales .which will bring important insights to my argument .since acceptance means buying a product , then advertisements may tend to exaggerate or seduce potential customers to persuade them into buying .since buying brings money to the company , and companies love money , more effort is put into adverstisements and marketing to boost sales .so to speak , we are tricked by pro s into buying .this is probabbly why we are sometimes fooled by advertisments .they are carefully made by experts who know what target market they want to reach , how they want to reach it , and , most importantly , how to convince that market .these experts have studied psychology , learned about human behavior , performed surveys , and thus know how to adequately sell a product .this scheme , this advertisement , triggers psychological needs that we have and makes us buy the product .we sometimes do not need it , but we end up buying it because how well it was sold .and it is after we assimilate how valuable this product , idea , or sevice really is to our daily lives that we then realize how we `` percieved  a product to be better than what it really is .it is as if we removed a blind fold , or eliminate the drug that fooled us into buying that good .we understand how it is not a real necessity , and so , how that product is not as good as we thought it was .the purpose of advertisements is to boost sales by convincing customers to buy a product .we may get tougher and smarter , but advertisers will also get tougher and smarter .what we then have to realize is how a product will improve and satisfy personal daily needs .this way we will not get fooled into buying something that is not as good as we were tricked into believeing . ..
