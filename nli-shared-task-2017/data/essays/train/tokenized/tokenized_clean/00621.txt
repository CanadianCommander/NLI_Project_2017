some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death .therefore , life does nt only end when one gets old .people usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action .however , older people tend to develop their mental inteligence and imagination .that why most of the philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak a their carreer when they are old .as a consequence , they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields , or by writting and thinking about life in general .but do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?i personally do not think it is the case .young people tend to look at life in a more material way , playing in parks , having a girlfriend , practising sports , therefore , they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living .it is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience .by growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore , trully appreciate the meaning of the life they are living .i saw once a film by a canadian director ( denys arcand ) named `` the barbaric invasions  that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life .the main caracter , an old man , looks past his life : the different books he read , the different women he slept with . .therefore , becomes furious of not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young , he finally decides to commit suicide .this if a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves , and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when being young .i think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest , whether young or old , by doing the things he enjoys doing the most .that is when he can reach a mental satisfaction , by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life that is to enjoy life .
