i have seen many different advertisement from the watching television .there are many different commercials on the tv .the variety number of company or government use advertisement for sales or give informations .back in this summer , i was in korea for visiting my family and staying around for 3 months .i was watching television program called `` home shopping  .the program shows diversed items everyday , all the time .while i was watching the home shopping program , i started getting into it .i realized that the advertisement made me to buy items even if i do nt need it .why it happends ?advertisement is a way of businesses increase their sales of items .it s very simple .the company needs to sell their goods as much as they can .the advertisement is a good way of increase their sales because it is easy for the people to contact and get informations .for increasing their sales , the commercial has to be mysterious or interesting .it causes people to have interest in their goods .many people gets hurt or regrets of their deal because advertisement make products look much better than what they really are .when i was 9 years old , i really wanted new shoes even though i had a brand new shoes .it was not because of i hated my shoes .it was because of the advertisement .the commercial advertising the shoes with my favorite animation .i affected commercial .i cajoled mother to get one of those shoes .i finally got the shoes but i definately not used it occastionally .i also wanted remote controll cars .i was entrancing in the advertisement .it looked amazing .i thought i will be really happy if i get one .i asked parents but they ignored .i cajoled mother to buy one for me .she spent a quiet money for that .she spent money for me even though we were not very wealthy .i was having great time with it for couple days , but i apparently got sick of it .it looked amazing in commercial , but the car was not really amazing at all .i felt guilty and wasteful .
