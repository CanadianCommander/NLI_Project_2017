nowadays , people make their advertisements so good so people will purchase , try , or use their products .however , are they really as good as they seem to be ?i strongly agree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in today s world , most of the people will do anything for money , even when it comes to the place where they will have to cheat on those who are innocent .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the same reason as well -- they want people to buy their products .we can see it everyday when we turn on the tv , commercials from fastfood restaurant , toy company , and even computer company .one of the most representative advertisement is the one from mcdonald .i still remember the first time i saw the commercial of mcdonald , they made their hamburger in the advertisement so big and juicy that it seemed to be the best hamburger in the whole wide world .and after seeing the commercial , the first thing i thought was to go to mcdonald and eat their juicy hamburger .however , after i had arrived at the mcdonald and ordered some of their best hamburgers , i realized that i had been cheated on .the hamburger i had in my hands was not an enormus , tasty hamburger .oppositely , it was a tiny , dry burger with only a few pickles in it .from the time on , i barely trusted any advertisements no matter how good they look .the second and the last time i was cheated on was when the famous computer purchasing channel had this seller who completely fooled me by saying and showing simultaneously that how strong the computer he was selling is .i was in the desire of needing a new computer , as a result , i called them without questioning and ordered the computer .soon , i regreted what i had done .the computer i recieved did not work at all , i could nt even turn it on .at first , i thought it was my problem , and thus , i called up my friend .what shocked me was that my friend told me that the computer did nt even have a graphic card .for the true stories above , i never trust any advertisements since then , i only believe in what i see , not what people say .to conclude , i absolutely , positively agree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
