i agree with the statement that succcessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .this is because , doing something new or taking a huge risk attract others , and by doing something new , people feels proud of themselves for doing it .by doing something new and developing , people with courages get attracted and becomes the followers of them .this gives the power and make them be as `` one  but not as a `` group  .this also attracts the people who tend to follow the risk takers .for example , martin luther king tend to take risks by going for the black people s rights with no violence .this made him to take a huge risk such as to be killed by the radical people .however , his new type of trial , which is nonviolent resistance , attracted a lot of people and lead his work to success .also , when he got arrested , many people who had similar feelings with him , such as president kenedy moved to help him out of the prison .this shows the attraction of the people who are doing something risktaking and innovative .also , by doing something innovative or novelty , people feels pride for it and therefore , their motivation increases .also by experiencing all the risks , hardships , and happiness together , they feel familiar and think them as a `` whole  but not individuals .takahumi horie , the founder of a japanese internet business company livedoor said that `` risktaking seems hard for many people , but going through the risks make people s work more valuable and lead them to success.  when he was awarded for the most innovative person in a year , in japan .i think that risktaking people are more successful than the people doing something that they already know well .this is because risktakers often attracts people and therefore , have a lot of power .also they take pride and work as a `` whole  but not individuals .
