i agree the statement that to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons .first , i can meet many people .for example , when i was a child at yosumi elementaly school in osaka , japan , in .i liked some subject such as an art class and a sports class .taking these class had opptunities of meeting people .when i joined an art festival because i wrote some painting for the art festival .i could meet famous artist who was tadanori yokoo .he was a great artist in japan so i was really glad to meet him , i became to like painting more then ever .second , i can study many things .when i was first year of grad-school at tsukuba university in japan .i studied hard many thing .for instance , i was not able to study only about design at university .so , i took many academic class , such as a reading class , a writing class a presentation class .alomost all university did nt need to take a presentation skill but i wanted to have the presentation skill , i took the presentainon class .taking the presentaion class was so hard but i had that skill at last .the presentation skill was important in current society .thus , i storongly agree the statement that to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
