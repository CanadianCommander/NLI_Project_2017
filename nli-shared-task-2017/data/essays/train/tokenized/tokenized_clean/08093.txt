i agree this statement .although i admit it is important that products has real quality , there are several reasons that i think advertisements make products more valuable and it is quite important .first of all advertisements give people to know about the products easily and convienetly .everyday we can meet lots of product ad by newspaper , and tv even internet .that gives people more belive it is good product .for example , one of american wine ad gives people belive that wine made from amercia is very good compared with made in france or chile .they ad by producing process and taste with some celebrity and change the common belief that american wine is low quality second , the advertisement represent the product s image .so sometimes people buy the product because of their image .for my personal experience , i like basketball so much in junior high school .i always play with my classmate but i am not tall it s very hard to jump up to catch the balll .i am very deprssed .however i watch the ad unexpectdly and it changes my life .it s air jordan shoes produced by nike .he jumps up so highly just like frogs .after watch the ad i buy the jirdan shoes and i am very confident at jumping and i can play well and i represent my junior school basketball team .of course jordan shoes is just one of the shoes but ad gives consumer it is more better than what it has and believe it is best shoes , in conclusion i firmly belive that ad make products seem much better because it s purpose is to sell the product .and nowadays people is very busy all days they are mostly dependant on ad to buy the product .
