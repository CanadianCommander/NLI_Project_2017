concerns about global warming and cuts of green house effect gases tend to make us believe that in the future , there will be less cars than there are today .however , i feel that this assumption is a bit rough and should be balanced .to put it straight i do not think that there will be a dramatic decrease in the number of cars .at least i do not think that it will occur everywhere .first , car is a means of transportation the advantages of wich are somewhat hard to challenge .it is probably the only means of transportation combining speed , 24/7 instant availability , high standard of comfort , security against attacks and possibility to reach in a decent number of hours any withdrawn place in a country .all other long distance means of transportation make you dependent on departure times , exasperating delays and complicated correspondances .for all these reasons i do not believe that need for cars will fall .what makes us think of an upcoming abandon of cars is the feeling that huge expense is done to incite people not to take their cars in city centers .in france , for instance , constant effort is done to improve the standard of service of railway networks in major towns .for example , the city of paris is building a tramway network at the moment .nevertheless , whatever important may be these efforts , cars will remain necessary to reach precise places at any time .moreover , in the countryside , it will long remain excessively expensive to create a powerful transportation network .what i feel is the most elevant reason why cars will not be abandoned is the feeling of independance that they bring .for young people for example , buying the first is an important step towards independance fromth
