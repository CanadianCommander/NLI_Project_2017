views differs greatly when it comes to the discussion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .on the one hand , some asserts that having a wide range of knowledge is better .while others thinks that it is better to specialize in one subject .however , i think it is better to have a broad range of knowledge .take engineers for example , they are very knowledgable when it comes to computer related problems .but they are so isolated in their computer field that when it comes to other subjects they have no clue .my friend john is the perfect example for such discussion .he is an excellent student in the engineering field .he can answer any question you might have regarding computers .however , when we are talking about other subjects , such as , art history , he can not join our conversation at all .another problem with focusing on just one single subject is that you will not know what else is out there .you might be interested in world history , but because you are specialized in one subject .you have to spend all your time studying that subject and have no time to study world history .one of these days , when you look back .that might be the one thing that you regret the most .nevertheless , specialize in one subject have its advantages .you will have a very clear and deep understanding of that subject .but when we compare the advantage and disadvantage of specializing in one specific subject or not , the most obvious selection is to have a broad knowledge of various of academic subjects .with the points noted in the discussion , i agree with the statement .i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
