a major feature in which we , the youth , differ from our predecessors , is in the amount of time we use in order to help our communities , which in some cases is none .multiple reasons are alleged , some say they lack of time whereas others accept they are to selfish to help others without a vested interest .it is true that nowadays young people are always rushing to and fro , since due to the competitive world we live in , we have really tight schedules .in addition to this , if you bear in mind a youth can not afford most of the times to live close to our workplaces , you have to count with the commuting times .for example i leave home at eight oclock each morning and do nt come back until eleven in the night .sometimes it is not only a matter of time but of upbringing .if a person has nt been taught to be generous , you ca nt expect from him or her to share his or her time for a certain task , eventhough when he or she understands it would benefit his or her community .it is a fact that moral values are decreasing and that a solution has to be found .i am perfectly aware of how difficult is to handle this problem , since my 15-year-old brother has plenty of time and although both me and my parents keep constantly encouraging him to do something for others , it has really no effect .fortunately , there is people whose work is mainly focused on providing those types of services to the community , but this should nt deter us from trying to improve ourselves , that s it , to reschedule or find a bit of time during the weekend and to bear in mind that the next generation will behave accordingly to what we teach them .
