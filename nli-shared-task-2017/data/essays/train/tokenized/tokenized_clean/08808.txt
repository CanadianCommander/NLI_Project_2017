in general , people have different learning method .for example , some student tend to memorize the facts without understading the ideas and concepts to keep it simple .however , i think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts for three reasons ; facts come from the ideas and concepts , it is easy to remind when you forget the facts , and this method brings student to improve independent studying skills .fact that people usually accept is occured after the ideas and the concepts .not a thing just happens .there are steps before it happens .for example , if i have a car accident , there must be ideas of drink and driving driver or me acrossing the road ignoring the light .similar to this , fact come from steps , ideas and steps to be here to believe .as well , it is easy to remind the fact when we forget it .if students understand all the ideas and concepts , it is not a problem to remind the fact by taking steps backward to where the fact come from .for example , when i took my math exam , i could not remember the formula .i tried to think of the process how the formula came from and finally i could make the formula which was exactly the same as i looked for .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts help to identify the facts .lastly , understaning ideas and concepts bring students to improve their independent studying skills .if the students do not know a fact or find a new fact from the ideas and concepts , they could continue to research for it .from this progress , they could expand their knowledge also share with others .although many students tend to learn and memorize the existing facts , i think they should understand ideas and concepts first because the fact comes from them .in addition , it is easy to remind the facts and it could improve students  independent studying skills .therefore , i think student shou
