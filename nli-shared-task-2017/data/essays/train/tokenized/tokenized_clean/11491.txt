some people may think that the older people enjoy life more than young people do .however in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because most of young people have a motivate to live and meet various people and hanging out with them make life more pleasant .young people have a dream .i believe that it is really great to have a goal in our life .young people s dreams are all different because of their fasinate desires such as ideal entertainers , parents , sportsmen , doctors , and artists .without this dreams , young people may live like a ` dead collapse  .for example , my friend longs to be a famous singer .therefore she practice her sing for more than 7 hours per day .she does not want to give up her dreams because she loves to spend her time to singing .she said when she practices the sing she feels like she is heaven .i do not think that older people do not have a goal any more because they already achieved it and their rapid life will make them to live in boredom .by meeting new people give young people an enjoyable life .everyday we approach new people .it is really fun to meet them who have all different characteristics , and appearances .when we meet someone who can reliable and want to be a companion to our lives then we called it `` pursuit of happiness  .for instantce , when i hang out with all my friends , i forget depression and lost stress .some times we spent our time to watching movie , and chilling about our daily lives .even though we feel irritation because of our consistant boring life , it will be fine if we have a true friend .at this time , i think i am not afraid of anything because always my friends being on my side .in my conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because we have a dream where we can motivate ourselves , and hanging out with friends more often without any worries .i am really happy to be part of young people ! .
