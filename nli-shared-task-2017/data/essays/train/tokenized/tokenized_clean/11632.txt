there are several advantages and disadvantages on this topic .some people think that you can only have success when you take risks , on the other hand there are a lot of people who do nt think like they do .one of the advantages can be that you gain experience of trying something new .you can not talk about it when you never made the experience .for example the last time i went to a restaurant and ordered lobster .i have never had lobster before , and i was afraid that the lobster would not be good .but it was not just good , it was great !furthermore , there are also disadvantages of being risky all the time .when you try out new things it can also happen that you get dissapointed .for example when you buy a movie on dvd that you have never seen .after watching it you maybe regret your decision in buying this movie .but there are also advantages of doing `` already known  things .no surprises , no catches , no strings .la quinta for example , a well known hotel in the southern states of america , makes commercial advertisement with this statement .so you know what the hotel is going to do to make your stay there as much comfortable as they can .on the other hand there is also the disadvantage that you can not develop yourself by trying out new things .though , you always stay on the same level .from this , i think there is not only one way to go .sometimes you have to be spontaneous and try new things out , but it s not always necessary .in my opinion , the best thing is to find a mixture between these two statements .i think that the `` middle way  is always the best , do nt go for extremes .
