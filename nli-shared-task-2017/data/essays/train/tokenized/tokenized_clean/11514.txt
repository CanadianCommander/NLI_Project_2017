although a demographic explosion will occur particularly in china and in india , i am absolutely under the impression that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all , governments are more and more concerned by the threat on the environment .although at the present time the lack of real global legislation is tangible , i am definitely convinced that in the future governments will be able to enforce sanctions against pollution .thus , sustainable development is more and more a part of political debates in the developed countries .everybody knows the dangers of use of gas cars on our earth .besides , governments will implement more public transportation networks particularly in some metropolis like los angeles where public transportation network is very bad .for example , a new tramway line was enforced in paris .moreover , goverments will encourage the development of co carriages by granting .positive discrimination towards these collective users can be a solution .therefore , new technologies will make gas cars disappear .electronic or solar cars will be on the market .these cars will be competitive because of the oil price crisis .nevertheless , the biggest challenge will be to convince the developing countries like china and india to fit to this new legislation .to conclude fundamental political , economical and environmental issues are at stake .this is a topical issue .
