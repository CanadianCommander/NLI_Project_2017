in order to be considered as one of successful people , you have to take risks in making decisions .because without these risky decisions that has been made by most of the great people thet wont be great .but the problem is not in taking the risk , it depends on the when and how of taking it .some of risks that are taken does not affect the decision maker at all but he should take it any ways .taking risks is very important in business life .because it may make jump in peoples life in some decisons such as the stock market and the big deals aroud the world for huge business .or in banking , bankers always take risks regrding their customer for bid and they stud the risk management sepratly as an indepndant subject like most univesities do in management schools .also , for political matters risks are very cretical spacially in wars beween cuntries such as the decision that bush made regrading the war on iraq .subsequently , if you take the risk with out any background or exparince you might be mistakin .on medical wise , risks are diffirent .they depnd on peoples lives .for example , taking risk in medical operation is very sensitive and cretical that might kill or affect the patient .but in this case the doctor and the patient should agree on .i consider risk as part of every body s life .because even if you dont out it in cosideration you do it by default , with families , at work and between frieds .nawdays , risk for some people is a skill that they own and convey .but being systamatic is no more seccussful in this world tha is full of comptetion and challeging thinghs .and i highly recommend to study riskmanagemng if you work in a bussiness that needs  .and i think that the most known businessmen were taking risk that made them to sucseed in life .
