being successful is great , very useful if you used to do good thing for your self or for the community and you could do many new things that you never did before and you could take risks .many successful people like to take their chanses so they try to do new things that they are nt used to it , sometimes those things could be risky and sometimes they ar nt .other successful people do the oppisite , they like to do everything that they are used to with out trying to change anything because that would made them safe and they do nt have to worry about anything .in my opinion i think that doing new things and take risks is better or let me say more suitable to my personality .i like to take chanses , i like to enjoy every moment of being alive even if that ment to take risks every once and while because being successfl is a gift from god which he chose me to have it so it s my jop to enjoy it as much as i could as a thanking to my god .another good thing about trying new things when you are successful is you could try travelling to poor countries and help them or you could go to children s hospitals in your country and give ill childrens gifts which will cheer them up .i think being successful whith out trying new things and taking risks is boring , unuseful as much as it should be and and helpful for the successful person or for the community so my advice to any and every successful person is he or she should wake up with a new look at life because that would help make the world a better place .
