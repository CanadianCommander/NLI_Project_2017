i agree with the statement that indicates that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are several reasons taken both from my life and my environment , which i will cover in the following paragraphs .firstly and maybe most importantly , the main affect that make people enjoy life less is the obligation of working .people who do not work for their , say , first 21 years of their lives suddenly face with a harsh professional working environment .it may include a low salary , hard working conditions or the lack of holidays .working everyday from early morning to evening ( or even night ! )consumes all the energy of the body and leaves nothing else to do in the limited time left to live your own life .especially , if you do not have the job of your dreams ( much-paying and less-working ) , everyday would be a nightmare .it is never like the good old days you had before , when only 20 hours of lecture and some studying were sufficient to pass the courses and have much time to enjoy in the university campus .responsibilities are another factor .it also includes the professional life .but there are other aspects too , like the effort needed to form and run a family .having children bring joy to life for sure , but greater responsibilities ; such as the education of the child , having to face almost impossible-to-handle situations , are factors that make the life taste bitter .finally , health-related issues are a big part of the deal .the difficult life conditions mentioned above bring other unwanted guests which are also known as illnesses .the mother nature also helps these guests , as we all know that the resistance to unwanted situations of a living creature decreases as the time proceeds .there would be exceptions to what i mentioned before .working children , unhealthy-born babies or improving ability to taste life with the gained experiences etc . ..but still , i do not believe that they are enough to overcome the fact that being young feels great .
