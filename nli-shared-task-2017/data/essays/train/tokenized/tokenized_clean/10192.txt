i think that to be a successuf people the people can try new things and take risks much than doing only what they already know how to do well , but when became succesful they often do only one thing .in fact often the person , who becames succesful , does one thig very very well : he knows how to do something and he does it .for example an succesful artist does his work very well .but for some other people that do nt have particular abilities , a good way to bacame successful is to try new things and take risk .but when they know how do well something , often they only do this thing .this is a pity because this beahviour makes their work so boring and i think that there is nt something that a person can know completely .in every materias there is new knowledge , for example in biology the scientists discover a lot of new things every years .another serious problem is the `` knowledge division  : for example an expert in lecterature can do nt know the common problem of pictures .for the cultures of people is a damage : every person has to be a bit interested in a lot of things .i think that real succesful people is people who have a great knowledge in a lot of thing .
