there is growing awarness of car problems all around the world .cars have brought us much convenience to transport while they have caused various social or ecological problems such as traffic jams , noise , traffic accidents , air pollution , too much consumption of petroleum and so on .now we have to solve these problems in order to survive on the earth .i think it essential for us to reduce the number of cars .first of all , we have to spend much money to maintain our own automobiles .in our modern society , we have so much developed public traffic that we need not to transport with our cars .although we would be involved terrible trafic jams , public traffic such as trains and subways are usually be punctual .moeover , in general , the fee of public traffic is inexpensive .therefore , we can save not only time but also money by using public traffic .the price of gasoline has gotten higher and higher recently , and the tendency is to be continued .second , there are no longer much place to park cars , especially in many cities .the world population has been getting more and more during this decade .now we have no longer much enough land to dwell on .therefore , it will cost us too much to park our own cars in the city .many people have to shed their own cars in order to save their money and to save the area to live in .in conclusion , for these reasons , spending much money and insuficient space to park cars , i agree the statement `` there will be fewer cars than there are today in twenty years .
