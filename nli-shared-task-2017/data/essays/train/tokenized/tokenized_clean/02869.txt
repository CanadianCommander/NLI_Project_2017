i think , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays is very important understand and know a little bit of everything .in my opinion , day after day , life is becoming harder than before , you need of a lot of different skills and competence , not just to find a good job but for every day life .for example , when you apply for a job , they ask you a lot of informations like : subjects studied at school and at the university , computer skills .in a lot of jobs , you need to speak more than one languages and moreover you have to be always updated with politics , economics and marketing informations .in these last years , the schools of different countries in europe , are improving the knowledge of many academic subjects .they are introducing many different subjects that are becoming more important for the life , like , computer courses , technical competence , marketing , economics and politics .in my opinion , it is very important to understand and to know different subjects , because you can talk with the people of differents matters and you can say your opinion .moreover , when you read newspaper , you can understand better the problem of the world .on the other hand , if you want to do a specific job , for example you want to be a children doctor you need to specialize in one specific subject .i think that there are a lot of jobs that needs of specific competence and you have to study very hard to specialize in one in one specific subject .i can not image if a doctor does not know well all the disease that a persons can have . ..what a mess will be
