worlds resources are ending fast today .resources like oil , natural gas which are major fuel to the modern car are limeted sources of energy .therefore i agree that in couple of decades , there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .with the effect of industrialisation in past two centuries the cultures have markedly changed , more ease in life , more amenities easy communication and travelling .but all of these on the cost of fuels , which are rapidly eaten up as time progressed .main fuels that are used in cars are gasoline , deisel , natural gas etc .these fuels scarcity has been now realized .they are hinted by the recent hike in oil prices all over the world .major gulf countries , which are abundant in oil fields are now increasing prices because of its growing demand considering its availability .solar cars are the good option to secure our future .but these source of energy is very inefficient and less productive than existing oil and natural gas fuels .electric car may sound good which uses battery to run the car and is supposed to replace future cars .but these batteries are to recharged again and again by electricity .now , from where the electricity comes .it is made by utilizing coal in thermal powerplants , from hydal powerplant and nuclear power plants .but since most of the powerplant in the world are thermal powerplants , which depands on coal and also a limited resource .it will probably be over in future .these fact also aggrevates the fact of availability of fewer car in future .hence it is the hightime that scientist today should find out the alternative ways to replace the existing fuels which are limited or face the bitter consequences of future .where the cars on road wil become history .
