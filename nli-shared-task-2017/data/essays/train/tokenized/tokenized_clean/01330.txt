the modern media and entertainment business has reached a level of which you can very easily reach a majority of the population , not only in your home country , but throughout the world .today not only newspapers , radio and television are the options to choose from , but for almost a decade now the internet has evolved to a new mass media platform , where anyone can communicate anything he likes around the world .thesedays a commercial does its best in trying to sell you a product in thirty seconds or less .in these few seconds , the creators of such commercials are not just a few people , but huge multibillion dollar companys , with an entire market analysis section , concentrated on selling just one product and finding out the best way to convince you of buying something you do nt really need .in order to achieve this goal , you need to push the boundaries of your product to a maximum .if , for example you have a simple , small device , which can play music , you will not sell it as a device with which you can hear music , but you will try to create a personality for this item .current techniques are iconizing a product .the best example at the moment is the ipod from apple .it is not anylonger just a product , but an absolute `` must have accessory  like a cellphone .in order to make this accessory attractive , you have celebrities carry it with them and music videos in which it appears and to put it simple , create a nice packaging around it .the same counts for the fashion industry .even if you have the new , landmark setting , groundbreaking couture collection , it still is just clothes .with the media , press and the right influential people , you can boost this collection to something more than just clothes .an older porsche commercial stated : `` a porsche is a car that nobody needs , but everybody wants  .in conclusion ; yes , most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .since people are becoming evermore used to the tricks commercials use , advertising companys look everywhere to find ways of selling a product as effectively as possible .in conclusion advertisements often can achieve the opposite and get very annoying .these can still not be critized , since we live in a consume based society and there is no indication that this will change in the future .
