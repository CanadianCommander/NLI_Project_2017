the statement of how successful are the people that try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is an interesting one and many times is also a controversial one .on one hand there are those that try new things and take risks .for example , there are those that are willing to put all their lives savings into a new business .others that , after 20 years decide to start a new career or even go back to school .nobody knows what the future holds .it is uncertain .some people are broke one day and rich the next .a new tv show called deal or no deal is a great example of how within seconds your decision might change your life for the good or for the bad .the show invites contestants to win up to a million dollars , and by within 10 to 15 they need to say if they want to accept the deal that the show offers or continue opening briefcases until they find their million .the key is that your briefcase might have 1 million as well as it could only have 1 penny .you decide how much you want to risk .donald trump is another example .it is publicly known that he lost a lot of his fortune years ago .to get to where he is now , he certainly took risks that paid off .other people , like the ceo of starbucks saw an opportunity to try something new and presently , his company is the #1 coffee company in the world .there are many factors to be taken into consideration when taking risks , because the size of the risk may vary depending on the decisons made through considering those factors .do i want to risk my 2 years savings for a trip to spain or do i want to use my kids college fund to start up my business ?one the other hand there are those that only do what they already know how to do well .we all know people like that or we might even be like that .it is a preference , a choice and many times a personality trait .people that are content with the fact that they wo nt go through that moment , day , hour or minute in life when they will hold their breath to wait to have gotten what they were looking for when we risked something , because most times , if not all , things that we risk are of value for us and many times , to those around us .in conclusion , i believe balance and most importantly passion are key for success .i have personaly taken risks in my live , and believe that without having taken them i would nt have achieved personal and mostly professional goals that i always wanted to achieve .in terms of balancing , how about taking the risk of opening a business of something i know how to do well or at least feel passion about ?
