i agree that successful people do find new things from there experienced knowledge .because there is nothing is not invented by the people , how the new things are producing day by day .so , people used to try for the new things by apllying there skills and abilities on the pertucular work .definitely one day they get success in there feild .like nowadays we are using different things which are we dont know how they are made and invented .behind thereid most hard work and greal knowledge of people who inventing them .trying to find new things is very much intrested and more imagination power should require .people are very talented that they are inventing different types of new things , that we ever seen before .these successful people are very intresting persons because their thoughts are amazing , unpreditable .because they have greate talent , good knowledge in their work , and mainly the strong ability to do the work by any cost time .they are very energetic to find new things .but the people who are doing in the work which is already know by them is not a greate thing .because doing the regular work brings us boring and tired at work .then they become the lazy fellows .their s mind alway taking rest .they do nt want to take risk in their life .its not a good idea .they have to think in different ways like how the world is moving fast .how the people grow day by day .such a new ideas brings them also in a sufficient way .finally , i concluded that successful people will always stand at top of world .they get many oppertunities to develope new things for their company and the society .successful people never work for them , they work for the nation and for the owl world .successful people are like the scientists , they think always diffrerently .but think positive and good for all .these people had many ideas in there mind and they enable put them in practicle .they should have greate future .`` a successful people will try until get the good results , and never stop trying
