cars are everthing in this world they have now become the only way of trasportation in land .this does not mean that cars are always going to be with us .in my opinon due to low oil production in the future cars will suffere in demand .also in twenty years from now other kinds of transportations may be developt that may under take the car industy .and also cause of oil prices cars will not be used us much .we have to face the truth , that cars may not always be wit us .cars in the present day work with oil .due to oil foling in supply the car industry is what is going to be affected the most .becuase cars need oil , in order to work and function .in 20 years many other people would have change to other ways of transportation cause they now that oil will run out and car prices will fall to the ground .this causing less cars in use then now .due to oil distuying the enviorment many people have created alternative transportation .some other people will find in easier just to buy a bike or another product to go and work .cars are just not perfect , and cause they are not perfect they will disapear .due to oil runing out cars will be very expensive cause there are only a few people that can buy a car and but gasoline .this will bring scarcity .due to this few people will buy cars and so causing other ways of transportation .in my opinion due to oil been such un important for car .the car will decrease in quantity sold .cause of taste of people , price , and other tecnological advances in the transportation industry .cars in 20 years from there will be fewer cars in use then now .
