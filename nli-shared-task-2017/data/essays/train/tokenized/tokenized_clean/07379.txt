`` the ideas and concept tends to create an intellectual  this proverb helds equally good when we talk about learing process involving proper understanding and concepts .it is not only , holds good for the student alone , but also holds good for each and every individual who are in the process of learing .though since the students are building blocks of the future generation , more emphasis should be given to them .besides , learing facts contributes very little in actual learning process .the very first point why the students should learn by understanding ideas and concept is that because once the students understand the concept , he/she can easily apply the concept in any field to solve the probem .no matter how difficult the problem is .for instance , in the regular classes of maths and physics , where the subject is occupy with full of formula and facts , it is very difficult to memorise all the formulas and facts stated in the book .but if student understands the ideas and concept then he can probably derive many formula by a single standard formula , then , in this case he / she does not need to remmember all difficult formulas which will be very exhaustive and time consuming .moreover , if the students only try to know the facts then there is a possibility that their knowledge will be narrow .what i meen is that when the problem comes which he/she is not aware then it will be very difficult for them to solve the problem because they only know the use of facts in one particular place .whereas , if the student has understood the concept and ideas then he / she can solve any of the problem by virtue of the underlying concept involved in that problem .on the other hand , learing facts also contributes in learing process upto certain extant .for example , in chemistry , until and unless students learn the periodic table , it will be very difficult for them to understand the rest of the inorganic chemistry , hence , in this case it is imperative for students to learn the facts also .to sum up , in majority of the fields , learning ideas and concepts are more beneficial because it gives the solution of a problem all the time .nevertheless , facts are important in fewer condition when compared to learing concept .but in general for the good knowledge and proper understanding combination of both would be better choice .
