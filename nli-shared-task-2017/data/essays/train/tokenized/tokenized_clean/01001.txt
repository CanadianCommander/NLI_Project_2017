`` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  i agree with this statement .probably the secret of many successful person might be this only .if people go on with the well known things they might feel their life bored and they ca nt think innovatively , which leads to miss their success hence the fame or reputation .for example a man could not be a scientist unless he try to invent or invent a new thing .for instance take the astronomers who would always think of doing something or discovering or analysing something new from the space which an simple man ought to do , make them to do ricks like space travelling .evenif they will fail once they would try besides their lives for new things .which makes them great successful citezens .i was always encouraged by my father to do new things so that i can give wings to my mind and think beyond and become a sucessfull guy in my society .which brought me several prizes by participating in the science fare .also when people try to do new things they will adopt for that and they will get habituated to those despite of the difficulty .also trying new things would also give some self satisfaction for oneself .if we do a new thing and succeeded in it we feel proud for that .it will also be play full to do new things .kids usually have this behaviour that is they would like to mplay alwaya with new toys or others which they like the most for them even candle light would be so attracted that they would like to touch it which may bring rick for them but unknowingly he does it and finds out what would happen uf he touches a harmful things .that is trying new things willl make a person to leatn new things which helps him through out hte lifefinally i conclude that going for newer thing make man more successfull .as success not means only success in acedemics or other but selfsatisfaction is also a type of success which makes us to stand still for any circumstances we face .
