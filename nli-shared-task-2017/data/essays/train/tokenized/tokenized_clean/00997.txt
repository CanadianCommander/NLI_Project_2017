i totally agree with the given statement .ideas and concepts are associated with the thinkers and innovators .whereas learning facts is associated with the followers .the understanding of an idea or concept gives students the ability to innovate , and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstances and problems .merely memorizing facts will simply let the student know of a particular solution , but would not empower him/her to develop new solutions .let us take the example of classical physics .there are several equations and several forms of equations .however , these numerous equations are derived from certain core concepts of principles .once these principles are understood , any equation can be derived .but the understanding of these concepts is extremely important to master trhe subject .this does not only hold true in the case of science / technology areas .understanding the concepts is critical to all areas of studies .for example , a management student refers to several case studies .but the intention for this is not to merely note the actions taken by earlier managers to deal with problems and to keep a record of the same .the intention is to analyse and think of possible solutions and to understand how the particular decision was taken .this approach would give future managers capability to come up with innovative solutions .today , we have so many electronic gadgets to manage data .do we wish to turn our brain into another data storage warehouse ?our brain can do something that not even the fastest computers can .that is to innovate , to think , and to get ideas .let us not waste it by encouraging students to give importance to merely learning facts .i am not averse to the idea of learning facts .it is important .knowing the facts enable us to speak confidently about a particular topic .however , knowing the concepts behind those facts is what will lead you to innovate new facts !
