i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .when i was a high school student , i usually learned just facts .it was a system of korean education .for example , in math class , i could learn a lot of information in short periord .however , i usually got low grade each tests .because teacher changed style fo problems in each tests , i could not use such factors which i learned before .that s why i think to understand ideas and concepts is more important .next , if i understand ideas and concepts of problems , i can use them in our lives time .for instance , i learned effective value of electronic products through my physics class .therefore , i can save utility fee because i can find which products are more effective than others in home .finally , if we know about concepts and idea of some accidents , unfortunate accidents would never happen in the future .for example , if we just know factors of invation from other counties , the invations would be face again because we did not know how to prepare them .obviously , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .we can use ideas and concepts in our lives and prepare bad accidents .
