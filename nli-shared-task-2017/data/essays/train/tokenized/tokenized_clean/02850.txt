one must realize that the statement according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today can be easily challenged or confirmedthis assumption is obviously inaccurate when compared to the various economic results and financial statements rendered nowadays by the car companies .except for a few of them , such as general motors in the usa or peugeot more recently in france ( both experiencing severe financial distress ) , the major companies have increased their financial income .the continuous purchase of cars by consumers as well as the perpetual will to consume that characterizes modern occidental societies explicitely proves that the car industry is booming .this phenomenon is nt likely to stop , especially when the wide variety of prices offered by the companies ( from the cheap car to the ultra luxurious one ) satisfies every consumer .the car industry adapts perfectly to the consumer , and it seems difficult to imagine that there will be less cars in twenty years than there might be today .nevertheless , this statement could be partially true , for three main reasons .first of all , major cities have nowadays developped various transport services for their inhabitants , which have the double advantage of being more useful and fast .it is unanimously admitted that taking the metro today is far more convenient than using a car , especially in cities where traffic jam seems to appear as the principle rather than the exception .second of all , the price of fuel has increased in such way that it now constitutes an undeniable factor to take into consideration in the purchase of a car .fuel being so expensive , any consumer will not necessarily be able to afford on a long-term basis the fuel necessary for his transports .finally , the ecological argument is more and more put forward to demonstrate how the use of cars can harm our environment .in my opinion , and this could be a possible solution , car companies should definitely invest in new and proper technologies , if they do nt want to see their products disappear .
