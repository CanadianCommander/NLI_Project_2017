i completely agree with the statement .i think that the only way to be successful is to fix a target and , once it has been achieved , to move it forward and try to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibilities to drop .many people think that the fortune has a big role to the way of success and i agree with them but i also think that fortune kisses just few people .i also think that success has not to be , always , linked to the money : there are a lot of good examples of doctors who are , of course , success person , but they are not rich as a big manager or owner of a multinational company .i also do nt think that success people are better than not-success people : there are people that naturally tend to the success and others that judge their life good enough without any kind of success .it happens that not-success people are happier than the others .i think i m a person who is forced to tend to the success : i do nt want a normal life as a lot of my friends have .i m fighting every day , fixing targets , sometimes impossible to get , in order to be able one day to say : `` ok , that  s enough for me  .i absolutely do nt think to be better than the others , as i said before , but i feel inside something that pushes me forward every single day : it s not a good sensation because there s always something i have to do or to run for .after the university , i moved to china for work : it has been a big chance for meut a lot of my friends disagreed with my choise because china was too far and i did nt need to go there to have a job .the problem was that i did nt want a normal job and it s exacty what success people want : they want to do something that is not common to other people in order to build a good career .
