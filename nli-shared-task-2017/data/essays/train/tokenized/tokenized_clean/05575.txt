first of all i have to say that i can not give an answer which matches on every young boy or girl .hence people , especialy young people , are very different from each other .but , by looking on most of the young people nowadays , i have to agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .most of the young people were very focused on their owen life .they see only themselves , nobody other .the best example is , when you take a regulary bus , which is driving around in a bigger town .as i was young , my father told me to leave my seat , if an older person wanted to set down her - or himself .i had to learn that sutch things were nothing special .at that time it was a normal education .nowadays nobody of the young people would do this .in most of the cases i could watch , they did not take a notice of the older person .people do only what they have to do , what they want to do or if they think they might get an advantage out of it .for young people this means : going to school , doing homework , playing computer games , meet friends in the shoppingmall and so on .but i do not want to give all the mistakes , young people do , back to them .they did not leared how to do it in a right way .that is the mistake of their parents who did not done well in there education .perhaps becourse they did not have enought time or only becourse they were not intrested in teaching their children .most parents think the tv-screen is a good babysitter for thier children , but in the tv things like helping your community is not shown very often .young people have to learn that they are not the only rock on the beach , but trying to explain this to them would like carrying orals to athen .
