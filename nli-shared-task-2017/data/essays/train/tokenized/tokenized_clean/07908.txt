i personally do not think that the travel in a tour with a guide is preferrable for several reasons .instead , i suggest the travel alone as a best way .this essay compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of travelling alone and in a group led by a tour guide .first of all , a tour led by a guide requires a set schedule : tourists can not go around as they like ; instead , they exclusively have to follow the guide all the day .by contrast , travelling alone permits a person much freedom : she or he can decide the schedule of that day according to her or his will .second , although the existence of a guide might seem to be helpful , it sometimes does not function so .for example , at the tourist site , the guide gives an explanation to it , and tourists just listen to the guide .this form of information-acquring is just passive .instead , i prefer learning things by myself actively , and i think this is the major advantage of travelling alone because the knowledge or memory acquired by positive attitude should be better than memory got by passive attitude .third , the guided tour might not allow people to take a closer look at tourist sites or monuments .since there is a certain number of people in the group , it is hard to estimate that an individual can have a closer look at tourist features until he or she gets satisfied .this is precisely due to the set schedule as indicated .people have to go around the one place to another in a rush in order to make it on time .again , on the contrary , sicne traveling alone allows much freedom , a traveler can take a closer look on the site or tourist features .having said that though , travelling in a group led by a guide does have some advantages such as : some interaction and socialised relationship amongst other members of the group ; safety because they travel with other people .however , as far as the first advantage of travelling in a group is concerned , it is still achievable even if it is a travel by alone .being open , friendly and social enables the traveller to have the interaction with other people along the journey : even if s/he does not have any friends or fellows at the beginning , s/he can acquire them through the trip , and this is the exactly exciting point of travelling alone .as far as the security issue is concerned , the advantage seems to rest upon travelling alone .yet , considering other aspects , as argued , travelling alone should be still entitled to be a desirable way of the journey overall .
