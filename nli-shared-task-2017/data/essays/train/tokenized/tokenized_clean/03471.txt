life is god s precious gift given to us .the life today is really busy and very much advanced and also became mechanistic when compared to older days .there are also so many communities formed according to ones cultures , traditions and rituals .coming to the young people nowadays are really dynamic and ver very hard working .their lives are really busy with so many priorities and prefereces to achive .so entangling in their personal work they are forgetting about their communities .i can honestly agree that young people are not paynig any attention and are not helping their communities .starting with a real example i would like to bringforth an event that occured with my very close friend .we are all five people a batch working for a software firm .my friend is our project co-ordinator , he belongs to a small hamlet near to my home town .in his community there is custom that the elder son should always attend the 9th day function that is conducted after a person s father is died .in the year 2002 my friends father died as he is the elder one he went to his home to attend his father s funeral after 3days a mail was sent from my office to report immediately at the office to attend a seminar in newzealand .he should attend the seminar because he is the coordinator of the project if not it results a huge loss for the company though he has to attend his father s 9th day function he gave priority to his job and left to newzealand making all his community especially his family very sorrowful .this is a genuinereason .besides there are also some dirty are nasty reasons that are making youngsters away from their communities .there are lot of people becoming drug addicts and consuming alchohal and also indulging in so many sexual pleasure which are of no availfor their future and also leading to less concentration on their communities even they least bother what hapepening with the community .summing up all pros and cons a community is place where one can derive total pleasure and a happy environment to live .hence , though the youngsters are very much entagled in their day todaay activities they should atleast have some time to participate in the community activities and help the people of the communities keeping in a mind that he afterall belongs to the community and his originn is the community .
