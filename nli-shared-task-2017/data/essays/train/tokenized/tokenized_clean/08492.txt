to enjoy life is the aim of the majority of people .everybody wants to be happy and not to be closed on one s problems , but it is quite difficult to be unaware of misery and all the plagues the world coneys .one s people life is so precious that everybody is looking for a fullfilled one and therefore there is no age to enjoy life .obviously there are differencies between the way of enjoying it for young people and old ones .first of all , young people are defined by being non-experienced and so it appears as an evidence that they want to live their lives fully ; they are generally opened on everything and interested in all what they see .young people are insatiable .moreover they have the priviledges of youth and they are allowed to have fun in different ways than old people .being aware of their fate , young people try to do whatever they want to in order not to have the impression of having spoilt their strenght s age .to enjoy life is not a schedule or a precise thing so everyone trying to do it in one s own way .it depends on what we are keen on doing or for example it can be determinated by the money we have .to that point of view , older people who are generally richer than young people are able to enjoy their lives thanks to the wealth .but wealth is not a warantee for being happy , especially when it does not sound with health .we might say that each of us enjoy life in a different way but there is no ageing consideration in happiness and for example a philosophy like the hedonism is one way to reach it and to ejoy life at every ages
