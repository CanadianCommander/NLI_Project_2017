i really aggree with this statement .to my mind , it is necessary for success to walk on new ways .this is the only opportunity to solve and to get along with problems in a successfull way .the first point to mention why i think that the statement above is correct is that people who only repeat their normal way of life do not focus on alternative sollutions .they have their known scheme to solve problems in their daily life .this might be for them a satisfying opportunity to live and to relax in their personal sphere .but this relaxation is the point why they are not successful as other people are .you have to take risks and to try new things to reach the level of success .your personal experiences and your knowledge make you understand the world and to react in several daily situations .but success is the product of knowledge and looking forward .risk is an essential element of looking forward .only by braking out of your normal life you can discover new perspectives in your job and your private area .to make it clear , i am not in the opinion that somebody should risk his life every day .`` risk  means to go an alternative way .a way , you wont go by reflecting only on your experiences .you can for example look for a new job when it offers more chances for your career .people should not only look on the money they can earn in their professions .they should more reflect on their career opportunities .let us talk about a young business man .he can open another coffee shop near the central station , the third in the street , or he can develop a fundamental new concept of selling goods .the research work before may be cost intensive and can be a risk .but when he has established a new product or a new selling method he is the only one having this advantage .this is a way of success .i think every person is curious from the birth to death .but the experiences we collect during our lifes make us a bit tired .to my mind , people who save this curiosity are more successfull than other .children try more .they risk more .this is the reason why they are so successfull in growing up in a relatively short period of time .you can only be successfull by thinking different .
