people have different opinions on whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .people who oppose this statement argue that in the future we will also have so many cars due to our convenience .they think that using cars are the most convenient way to go another places .however , i disagree with this statement for two reasons .first of all , in the future , we will have other methods to go another place .another reason is that in twenty years , we will go abroad more often .let me explain the reasons in detail .to begin with , in twenty years we will have more developed machines instead of cars .when my grand-grandfather was a child , he can not imagine cars which is privailing nowadays .he watched cars only in movies .this was because in the past , wagon or horse were the only transportations .however , nowadays we have a lots of transportations such as bus , subways and airplane .it means that our technology has rapidly development .therefore , in the future , we will have more technological transportation .next , in the future we can go abroad more frenquently .it means that we feel no need to use cars .we will usually take airplanes instead of cars .this is because using cars can not go foreign countries .when i was young , i just traveled in my country .however , now things were totally different .recently , many schools plan their vacation for student go abroad .in addition , if they travel another country , they have to take airplanes , not cars .this means that in the future , we will use airplanes for going abroad more often than use cars .in conclusion , i support the idea which is that in next generation there will be fewer cars in use that there are today for the reasons that i mentioned above .first , we are supposed to have other transportation instead of cars .second , in the future , we will go abroad more often .therefore we use airplane frenquently .it brings about decreasing of using cars .
