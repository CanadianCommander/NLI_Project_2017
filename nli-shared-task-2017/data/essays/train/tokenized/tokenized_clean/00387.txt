car was among the most significant inventions in the 20th century .it has greatly improved transportation and brought tremendous convenience to our lives .however , today , some people start to believe that car usage is going to decline in the near future .nonsensical ?not really .i do agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .i will now explain my points .first , twenty years later , it is very likely that other means of transpotation , such as aeroplanes and trains , will take over cars .today , travelling by air is already getting cheaper and faster .with all the budget airlines emerging and the major air companies expanding their routs , air transportation system is going to get more established and more convenient .the same is happening to train transporation sector .therefore , when this phenomenon continues to take place , cars will soon lose their popularity , especially when coupled with the next problem .most people may also stop driving as the cost of driving continue to increase .by cost of driving , i am chiefly refering to the cost of petrol .petrol price is constantly on its rise today .twenty years later , petrol price may become so high that many people may not be able to afford using a car .hence , with many substitutes available , such as air-traveling and train-traveling , it is logical to expect a decline in car usage twenty years down the road .last but not least , people are getting more and more environmentally conscious today .this consciousness is expected to discourage car usage in the future , so as to reduce air and noise pollution that most big cities are experiencing now .people may switch to public transports for travelling within the city .some people may even choose to cycle instead of driving .in other words , as people get more educated and concern about the environment more , one can expect the see less cars in the future .in essence , cars may once be the favorite of man in terms of traveling , but reality shows that this may not be the case soon .
