i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays young people became more interested of spinding alote of time on vedeo games , enternet chating , shoping , and watching tv .one of the important reasone that make young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is the change in the enviroments around themselfs .for example , the improvment of technolegy create other way for spending time instated of specifing the enough time to helping their communities .anather reasone that parents do not encarege the young people to give enough time to helping their communities .schools are also do not pay a tention for teatching young people the importance of helping their communities .thus , it is not one specific resone lead to the behavore of the young people nowadays where they do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is the responcepelty of the family , schools , and the other socity factores which where reflectted negativety on them .
