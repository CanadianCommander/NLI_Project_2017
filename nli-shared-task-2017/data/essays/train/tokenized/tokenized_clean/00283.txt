i agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .let me talk about two reasons .one reason is that products in magagine advertisements seem more beautiful than they really are .for example when the beautiful woman wore a dress in the magagine advertisements the dress seemed so beautihful because of the beauty of this woman .but when i wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful .because i am not beautiful .also the shape of the dress changed because i was fat and the dress was really tiny .i could not realize that the dress was tiny because the beautiful woman in magagine was really thick and beautiful body .second reason is that products in tv advertisements seem more useful than they really are .for example when the famous cook uses the knife in tv advertisements this knife will seem more useful .because the famous cook can really can cook very well .but if i or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well .because we do not like cooking and we hardly use the knife .therefore i think most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
