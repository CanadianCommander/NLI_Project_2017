from my point of view , i see that most of commercials make goods more attractive and better than really are .and i found that from my experince and from what i heared from my relatives and friends .although advertisements sometimes are necessary , but still there are a lot od deceiving and misleading to custemors .also for me is wasting time to see , hear and reading advertisements .from my own experience i saw an advertisement in the tv about a medicine that will realive the pain pf feet and it was very attractive , so i call for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed .and i heared a lot of stories from my friends and relatives and the same things happend occationally to them in other stuffs that they bought .i know it is sometimes there are advantiges from commercials , they will expose as to the new and developed technology , materials and a lot of things .but still i there are another ways to know about these things from others sources like depedent research and from the experience of others .i believe commercials wasr my time a lot for a lot of reasons , it takes time from me when viewing prgrams on tv , like news , shows , sports and almost in every thing .and commercails also in radio , newspapaers , magazins and everywhere .all that a real wasting in my time .so i am sure of the fact that advertisments mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is .i realize they are not for me those commercials , it make profits for me , so i do nt agree with the above statement .
