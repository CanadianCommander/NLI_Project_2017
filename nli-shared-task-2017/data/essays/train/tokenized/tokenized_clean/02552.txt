depending on personal experience , personality types and emotional conern , we find that some people hold the idea of learning facts which are important .while others prefer to understanding ideas and concepts .from my point of view , it is more advisable to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .the main reason for my propersity for this point is that concepts is from humans  activities and object fact .for example , why does an apple fall down ?this is a fact that everybody knows .if you understand the ideas and concept which the earth has gravity .not only does you understand easily the reason of an apple falling down , but also you can understand everything related problems .another reason can be seen by every one for my point is that understanding ideas and concepts have numerous benefits to our life .for instance , socialization is a concepts that a process for a persos to learn from infant to child to adult .if you know this concept , you can find many agents of socalization , such as your parents , your peers , and your teachers .you find these agents influence your behaviors .if you just know people need to join the social activities , you may not know who you should be learn from .third , in spite of there are some advantages to learn facts , such as it is earier and simpler , i feel that the advantages of understand ideas and concepts are more obvious .taking into account of all these factors , we may reach the conclusion that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
