i agree with the following statement .when you see the television or newspaper , you can see adverstisement from any company .why they are making advertisement ?cause , the company want make more money from sell it where you can see from advertisement .so it gives more profit .the comericial is kind of advertisement .when you want to watch television program .you just turn on television .so you can see any comercial before start tv program .it looks so good whichs means , you want to buy it which you saw from tv .it makes you want to buy it .it gives you a lot of information about things from advertisement , and you can figure out it whichone is good for me compare with other things .finally , you would better one .probably , you do nt want to buy things without information about it .because , you have to check price , quality .size , etc . ..but , all of the information is not true from the advertisement .for example , it says `` this one is powerful more than otherone .so everyone could think it is true .but you really do nt know before you diretly check by yourself .every advertisement company want us to buy their things against other company which is make similar kinds .so sometimes , they just make advertisement like untruely .but if they cut from crowd , they get huge damage from that .so they trying to make best one which is cheaper and better than other company .it s a challenge .the challenge is good for make things .if you are the only one person who can make computer , you will get a lot money from peoples .everyone s buy it .but you are not gonna make better one .cause you do nt have to try to make it .because , you can only make computer which means there is no challenge .anyway .the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .but they have to make good things andthen try to make advertisement for show to peoples .
