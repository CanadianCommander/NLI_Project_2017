saying that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is , in my opinion , false .currently peaple need more and more mooving essentially for their job .in developing countries , car is one of the more used transport system .today we are addicted to our car .it is thrue that there are environemental problems caused by the fact that cars consume gasoiline and that reserves of petrol decrease .it is a real probleme yet , and some peaple says that when we will not have petrol it will be not possible to continue to drive our car .but it is not my mind , i trust in research and sciences i am sure that in twenty years we always will driving but with another oil wich will be better for the nature and the environement .new sort of oil are tested like agriculture oil for exemple .but the main futur energy are clean s energy : like wind , sun and electricity .some engenneer students have made some experiences in order to taste a car witch goes on with solar energy .today honda had market an hybrid car witch use two differents energy : gasoline and electricity .we can even buy a car witch use electricity or natural gaz today .the probleme is the expensive price , but i thing that in twenty years progresse will decrease the price of this new sort of clear car unless the price of petrol decrease . ..i think that i am realistic if i says that it s impossible that the petrol price drop because reserves are less and less important and it can not change .
