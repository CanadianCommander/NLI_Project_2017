there are different way for people traveling .travel is in a group led by a tour guide is one of ways , which advantage are more convenient and more cheap , people can do not every thing , just follow in the group led by a tourguide , but disadvantage is on free no choice , people can not play and travel which they want .so i am not agree with the following statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i think people traveling for relaxs and make self happy .people work long time want to travel , maybe with friends or boyfriend or girlfriend , i think they want have spaces of self , want have free or choice of self .like me , when in my holiday , i want travel with my boy friend , i want have spaces of us , i want have a remantic traveling , however , if we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide , will has another people in my spaces .i think we will nit happy .and some travelers like traveling by self and travel to alot of place or countries , but some time tour guide don not have the group which the travelers  want , so will make the traveler spend long time in check in the group for travelling .travelers will mistake good chance and time to the places or country where they most want to go .hence , from above i statement , travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a good a way , but not best way , sometime people can choice the way according the need and like .thus i think trave is in a group led by tour guide is not best way .
