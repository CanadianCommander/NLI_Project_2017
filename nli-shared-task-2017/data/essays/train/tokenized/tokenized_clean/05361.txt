is is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .for example , a business person that has an expanding and growing company will probadly diversify his activities and explore new areas .the background of this scenery is a feeling of confidence .once you can prove to yourself and to others , what you are capable of then appoval is no longer at stake .you do nt have make a statement on your capacities and inteligence , you have already done that .now it is time for the next goal .and in this line , ambition plays a very important part .human beings have a tendency to be unsatisfied .once you have reached an aim , another emerges .as soon as you realise that you were able to do what you had set your mind and spirit to , the following project comes along .this is a way of maintaining your self steem as high as possible .always looking for self realisation on the outside world .however positive projects are in a person s life , i believe that other things should be taken into account aswell .for instance , being able to enjoy what you have produced .if you are an important congress man , it is my opinion that before running for president you make the most out of what you are living and feel proud of what you have already accomplished .moreover , there has to be a stop in the race for constant success .otherwise you might be spending most of your time analysing new projects rather than recognising your achievements .if you were able to buy a beautiful house thanks to your dedication and hard work , my advice would be to enjoy it and share time with your family instead of working even harder to purchase a bigger one .all in all , it is my personal opinion that there should be a balance between new aims and enjoying those already met .in order to be successful you have to be able to feel happy with what you have .
