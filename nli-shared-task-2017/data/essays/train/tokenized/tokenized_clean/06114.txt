i do agree with the statement that in the twenty years there will be fewer cars than they are today .there are many reasons for this like the environmental impact , the distance to be travelled , the traffic problem , cost of the fuel , increase in the labour charges for fixing the car , the policies of the government , etc .these are explained as below .first , from the environmental point of view cars are a major source of pollution pouring heavy amounts of carbon monoxide in to the atmosphere .so many people are these days much aware of the environment and are intending to live in a pollution free cities and towns .the people stopped buying cars in many of the countries these days and are resorting to other means of transport like trains and buses which carry many passengers at a time having a negligent effect on the environment when compare to cars if all those people travel in each .second , these days since the cities being fully developed and no places being left in the city so many of the firms are being shifted to the outskirts of the city .many people will find it difficult to travel to the outskirts of the city in a car as the distance is much longer and they also find it safer to travel by trains and buses .it is also cheaper when compared to travelling by a car .the railways and the public tranportation these days have been developed a lot and it is much safer these days to travel by these sources .third , the traffic problem and the cost of the fuel .as the population has increased the number of vehicles people used has also increased by a considerable number as a result the traffic in the towns and cities is very heavy .many people found that it is very stressful to drive in such a heavy traffic and the accidents have also increased .moreover the cost of the fuel like diesel and petrol is increasing day by day and people are finding it much difficult to pay so much for the fuel .in the twenty years the fuel may cost twice or thrice of the present cost .the labour charges for fixing the car have also increased by a considerable amount and in the future they are may be five to six times more .finally the traffic in the cities and towns is very heavy and the people have to get struck inthe traffic for hours and hours .the parking lots alloted for the cars are filled by half the customers in the shopping malls and the people are finding it difficult to park the cars .the goverment also imposed amny restrictions on the owners of the cars like cars should not be used for more than 10 years , they have to have the pollution check certified every two months , etc .i hope that people will stop buying cars in the next twenty years basing on alll these factors .but however the travel by car is very convinient as we can travel at any time we need .
