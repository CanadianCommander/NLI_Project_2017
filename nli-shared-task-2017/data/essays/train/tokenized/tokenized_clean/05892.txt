whether or not young people enjoy life more than older people do is an interesting question , and i for one disagree with that statement .first and foremost one has to understand that enjoying oneself does not necessarily have to mean enjoying similar things .with that in mind , it becomes clear that older people do not necessarily enjoy life less than young people do .first , let s look at two different rather popular activities for both , the young and the old .how about sports - sports is a rather popular pasttime activity for the younger generation .but it s also an important part of older people s lifes , a point that is supported by the fact that certain activities that have fascinated the older generation first but have now moved on to include the younger generation as well ( without of course losing any importance to the older generation , it s like a side-by-side activity ) do exist .sports can therefore be enjoyed by both , the young and the old , and does not leave anyone behind .if you do nt feel like jumping down a cliff into the ocean then do nt - there s other activities like running , iceskating or , the one i referred to above to illustrate an activity moving down the generational ladder rather than up : nordic walking .and what about a very different pasttime activity that both , the yound and the old enjoy : going out and enjoying oneself with friends .while the youth has bars , pubs and clubs to enjoy itself , the older generation usually prefers locations with less noise and more atmosphere , yet not necessarily less fun .if one enjoys a nice restaurant or a dance then age does nt really matter - a 90-year old can enjoy himself next to a 30-year old and both will be having a blast .yet another point i would like to make is money and time .it s a known fact that older people , especially retirees , statistically have more money to spend than younger people , who might have to support an entire family of four or more on one single income , do .and unfortunately , in our society money equals fun .a very good example is travelling , which in our society is just another word for seemingly endless enjoyment all over the world .travelling is quite expensive though , a family of four will not be able to afford a carribean cruise on a ship , nor will it have time or money for an extended cruise or travels that last longer than a week or two .with more time on their hands older people can usually sit back and relax , enjoy their free time in foreign countries or even at home with their friends .which , as my final point , is what i think the most important factor of enjoying oneself .friends are the salt in the soup , and while older people do nt tend to have more friends than the younger generation ( true , i do nt have any hard evidence to support this , but it has been my general observation in my immediate environment ) , they usually tend to have closer friends that they have known for decades .sharing ones life with a life partner or a good friend is what makes life worth living to some people , and in order to do that age does nt matter - attitude matters .i think i have made my point clear that i do not think that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .from the outside and from a rather superficial point of view this might seem to be the case , given that according to the media - which unfortunately is made mostly for young people - only young people seem to enjoy life on tv and in the movies .it s a certain stereotype that the movie industry has been presenting us for many years and it seems to have attached itself to our society where age equals boredom and loneliness .personally i think that if i had a time machine and would be able to look at a 20 years older me i would discover , that the older me would still be having fun in life and enjoying itself just as the young me does right now .
