i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .although i agree with this , i think there is a difference of the meaning of `` enjoy  between young people and older people .at any time , we have a large generation gap between youngs and older people .and i think nowadays that gap is increasing more and more .i want to show the example of the conversation between my mother and i , when we were watching `` gohst in the sell  , which is japanese tv animation about the future world that people live with robots .in the story , almost all people have a computer brain in thier head instead of real brain , and they can process the information or the data that they see through thier eyes , like a computer now we are using .in that world `` ture human  which are like us , are decreasing .even they have a real brain in thier head , which is just tiny part of it for living .after watching this animation , i excited about the concept of the sotry .for me the computer is a really familiar thing .everyday i use my computer for the assignments which are given by my high school teachers .also i stoarge my favorite pictures , musics , and movies in my computer .so when i watch `` gohst in the sell  i even thought that i want the computer brain in my head !but my mother was defferent .firstly she couldt understand any concepts about this story .she couldt understant why the computer brain in people s brain , why they are not robots and so on .finally she said `` it is so boring .in truth , there are lot of dificult words about computer system , and also confusing time passege was in the story .but i really suprised at the fact that she did nt enjoy the story .and i realised that what i enjoy is not always what my mother enjoys .the meaning of `` enjoy  is different between young people and older people .however as i said above , these days , technology is everyday improving .new things such as computers are sometimes difficult for older people .but i know that there are many ways of enjoying life .i understand that everyone enjoy thier own life very much .
