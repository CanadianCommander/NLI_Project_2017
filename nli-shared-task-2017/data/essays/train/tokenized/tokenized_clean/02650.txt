as the countries of the world progress into the 21st century , the ever-increasing complexities have yet again slapped the question of time-management on the face youngsters today .however , i feel the young people of this century have responded splendidly by ensuring enough time for all activities .the youngster s of today are vibrant , dynamic , filled with an ever-increasing enthusiam to perform , achieve , aim high but in all this they still maintain their standards and attitude towards life .various qutodian examples of this can be citied from our society .renowed writer and booker prize winner arundithi roy is a classical example of this .she has not only helped in the cause of the ` narmada bacho abhiyan  ( for saving the river of narmada in india from pollution etc . )by preventing the formation of a dam that would have hampered the flora and the fauna of the region tremendously but has also added fuel to the fire by gainings wide-spread public sympathy and amenable opinion on this .the founder of ` microsoft  ( the no1 software firm in the world ) , bill gates has contributed tremendously towards various social causes like building up cancer hospitals , adopting entrie villages after the tsunami earthquake and promoting education at all levels .this would have definately required him to take out immense amount of time from his work and he stands as a perfect example with whom the youngsters of today relate .a very qutodian example can be cited as that of my own society s ` help the needy  organisation of which i am an active member .this voluntary organisation aims at heping not only those ( humans and animals ) who are needy but also aims at spreading similar feelings and enculcating in the youngster s of today the very essence of helping their community .at ground levels , it can be seen that the youngster of today are striving to help their communities and society as a whole by ensuring reforms are enacted and implemented correctly .the youngsters today are intelligent and discerning and they know that by helping their communities and societies they are actually helping in making their own future better .
