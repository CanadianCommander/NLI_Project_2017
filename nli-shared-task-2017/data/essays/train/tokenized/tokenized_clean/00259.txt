today man s dependence on automobiles is very much and will increase in the future .i disagree with the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .man is very much dependent on cars which forms his basic means of locomotion without which he can not dream of going out .he uses his car for many resons such as to go for work , to go out etc .futhermore the public transport is limited on which he ca nt rely upon for evereything .in order to access public transport he should go to bus stations or to railway stations for which he should have some sort of transport to take him from home to those places .the main thing which causes us to believe that cars will become lesser in twenty years is the pollution .automobiles cause a lot of pollution but recent adavancements in technology have provided new technologies that decrease pollution to a large extent .new technologies have come which help to reduce the pollution created by the automobiles and to make them more fuel efficient which is also a mojor concern for the car users .new technologies such as use of natural gas instead of petrol and diesel have come which decrease the pollution by a large extent .this is also cost effective and has become popular in the developing countries like india .another technology which is more reliable is the use of battery power to run the cars and this causes zero pollution .technologies like use of hydrogen gas as a fuel is also on consideration and research is still going on in this field .new technologies in the field of manufacturing are also coming which increase the durability of automobiles to a great extent i.e , they last longer .upon considering the following factors and reasons i dont think that there will be a decrease in the number of cars in the next twenty years .
