i think there  re two groups of people when we speak about success : people who gains a better position using at best it s own qualities and others that reach the goal thanks to the luck or to other people .in the first case if we pay attention to the past story of the person who makes success we can surelly find an invenction , an idea , a kind of stroke of genius that changed his/her existence .i do nt state that luck is unuseful in this occasion , but i can adfirm that it plays a secondary role .when we speak about success we generally refer to the world of our job .in my opinion it s easy to see that often the success is related to the ability of an individual to be able to solve different tasks in diverse fields .and these eccletticism can be formed during one s life in many ways : the most important is trying to have interest in different directions .risking to do something we think we can  t do permitts us to discover our limits and in many cases to trapass them .for these reason i agree with the statement .let s consider a high-specialized person in a job : we aspect him to defeat the oppositors thanks to his knowledge in his field ; maybe he believes it too , so he does nt look for new challenges .but nowadays it s difficoult to find a situation we can solve using narrow skills ; we try to cohoperact to fin a solution .this shows how we have to depend from other people if we do nt have the braveness to risk and to aquire a broad knowledge also in fields we do nt consider exactly as `` our  .can we reach the success if our destiny is so strictly related to other people ?moreover we have to consider that this people is often in challenge with us for a better position .if we look for new experiences which can enrich our luggage of knowledge , we break the bridge that unites us to our mates ; so we can find an easier way to the success .maybe it could be dangerous because a failure can stand for the gain of a lower position .when we have the skills and we are brave enough to risk at the right moment we can manage to surpass lying people and to obtain success .
