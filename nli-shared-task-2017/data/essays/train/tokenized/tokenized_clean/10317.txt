the issue at hand is if young people nowadays participate enough in helping their communities .this issue is important because it is directly related to our daily habits .in my view young people do not take the time to helping their communities because they have other responsabilties to take care of first .first , young people first think to their obligations .school has taken an important part in our students life which can not be neglictated .the work required from school is so abondant that it makes more difficult for students to bring their help for their communities .i think that can be consider as an eventual explanation of why young people do not give enough time for supporting their communities .secondly , we are living in a society where appears more and more distractions .young people prefer getting some relax after school rather than getting involve to another thing .helping communities required involvement and concentration which can be considered as similar as school so it is not really restfull .this point shows another aternaltive to explain this fact .additionnally , as it has been mentioned previously communities required involvement from us which means that we also have to be interesting in what they are goin to undertake .the subject or the actions might just interest young people .for example , if our community wants to prevent from steals or breakinf houses they will need volunteers .if nobody has encounter that kind of problems , they might not be interessting in getting involve to this .therefore not a lot of people will be in .this can be anothe aspect of the lack of yound people in helping their communities .to sum it up , their involvment at school , the fact that there are more and more distractions and finally that the actions made by the community may not interest young people can affect their involvement .howeve , they should have a look at it when living in community .
