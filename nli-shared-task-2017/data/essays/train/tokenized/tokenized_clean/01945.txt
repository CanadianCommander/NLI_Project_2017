in my opinion , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well becase of creating a chance to be success and possibility of sucess .first of all , if i am doing what i were already getting used to , i could never get a chace to make a lot of money or to sharply developed by myself because i would think same way and situations .when we see a sucessful people , they tried several aspects and a lot of ways with the risks .for example , i went to a seminar which donald triump opened in new york city two weeks ago , i heard that only people who catch a good idea and chance with risks can be sucessed .moreover , if i try to get new things , i believe i have more percentage of development .there is an article pressed by korea times in 2006 that introduced a man graduated from seoul university in korea with bechelor degree sells a sandwich and kimbab ( korean sushi ) .he makes more than $ 100,000 per a year .therefore , i firmly believe that in order to get new chance and good idea and grow up my possiblity of sucess , i should try new things and creative experiences .that is why i agree with that .
