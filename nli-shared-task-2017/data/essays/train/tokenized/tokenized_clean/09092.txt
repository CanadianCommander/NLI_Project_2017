while many people think that it is more important for student to undertand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , i think that a stronger case can be made by pointing out that learning about facts and real cases of life can give the student the opportinity to re-live togheter with the people invloved in those cases the situation which they went through .it is important to undertant well the concepts but nothing as study a real case .learning cases method leads the students to a group of posible solutions and teaches them how those solutions affect the final result .however to get involved in the facts and real life cases , needs a previous preparation obtained not only by the well understanding of ideas related to the fact , but also by the study of all the material concerning the case .in many universities programs , the profesors make a well balance combination of both methods and they obtain very good results .first they prepare the ideas and material to be learned by the students and after they present the real fact .it permits the student to apply their recent acquired knoledge and give their best result in order to reach a solution .not only the result gived by the student , but the final solution is then compared with what really happend .it allows students to know wich solution to the problem was right and wich one was wrong .a survey made by people maganize by the end of the year 2002 , shown that the learn real facts methods had a better approach of the right solutions to a specific problem that had the traditional method of just understand the ideas without application .there also exists thoudands of studies that support this topic .for that reason i think that undertanding ideas alone without application in real life , is not much a good method as it is the applicability in already lived cases .
