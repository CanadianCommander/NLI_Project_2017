on of the big topics in this new century is the pollution of our world , especcially of the air .to give our children a chance to live healthy on this world , the are some possibilities to the air pollution : one of the most factors causes air pollution are our cars .so a lot of states and countries think about strategies to increase the sum of cars in the next 20 years .they invest money in new and more economic bus - , train - or tube-systems .to use this transport system in the future has got a second advantage , too .in every bog city , there is a parking-problem .but the cities are rising , too .and so every month a parking place chances to a new building .in future more and more people wo nt have an other possiblity for arriving their jobs than to use this public transport systems .so the cars will be less at our streets .another reason to disagree with this statement is the oil .in some years , there wo nt be as much oil as today at our earth and therefore the petrol price will rice to regions much people wo nt be able to pay for .ok , there are inventions for non-petrol cars .but nobody really support that because of the big influence of the oil industry .so a lot of people will sell their cars and move with public systems or trains .a third reason to disagree is that there will be new kinds of transportation-systems in 20 years .perhaps everybody has got a small plane .we wo nt have any streets .only fly on the magnetic field of our earth without any petrol or electicity .or we get beamed to every place on earth like in `` spaceship enterprice  ?20 years , that s a very long time , and looking back to the last 20 years , a lot of things , nobody thought about , has been invented .we only need someone who invents this kinds of transport system , and then , i m sure , nobody wo nt use something like a car !because of this main reasons , i must disagree with the statement and can look hopefully into the future with clean air for us , our children , ...
