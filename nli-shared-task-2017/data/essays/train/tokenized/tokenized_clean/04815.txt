i agree with the fact that young people do nt give enough time to helping their communities .before i give the reasons and examples , i want to clarity the word young people .according to my essay , young people means the people at the of 15 to 25 .below and after those ages are out of the scope of my essay .if we look at the global trends in the world today , we see that it is mainly a world based on consuming more and more .consuming in the sense that , our happiness is getting more and more directly related to having more personal material under us .if it is not the same for every young person , it is the same among my friends .the main reason why i agree with the statement is because i believe that he world that we live in today is very individualised .the reason for this is the one that i explained before .in today s life , we have huge resources of data , huge amounts of toys to spend time and etc .people keep on spending time with those toys or vast amount of data that are available .for those people , having a time for other things are almost inevitable .as an example , i can give people who dedicate their lives to massive multiplayer online role playing games .i know my friends play these games for days continously just to have a better character in the game that results in a better reputation among their friends .in the scope of this example , for many people , helping out the community is just a waste of time .something that does not possess any value in it .because they do nt gain anything materially by helping out people .in conclusion , i think the way young people see the world is the problem here .we live in a world which is dominated by consuming trends .the happiness in today s world comes from material happiness , and for many young people around me , helping out the community is most of the time nothing but a wastage of time just because it gives nothing to their material possessions .
