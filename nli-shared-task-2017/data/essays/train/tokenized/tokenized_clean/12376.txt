i disagree with the opinion that there are fewer cars in use than there are today .nowadays , cars support a lot of things , such as nation , corporation of cars , our life .there are two reasons for my opinions : convenience and economic .first of all , cars is so convenient for us to move somewhere .in modern cities or nations in all over the world , most societies is cars society .the family living in town has one or two cars .it is impossible for us in modern societies to discover the person who do not have car or use car .for instance , my familiy has four cars such as my fathers , mine , my aunt , and my brother .my father go to his corporation by his car every day .futhermore , if you want to go to somewhere , car bring us to the place where we would like to go .today , we are helped by cars whenever we transfer anywhere and we feel convenient of useing the car .second of all , cars societies help our ecomomic situation .most people is use the cars .for example , in order to use the cars , we must buy it .all in all , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .we do not think the world that there are not cars at all because of convenience and economic .
