i disagree with the statement .students have to understand the main ideas and concepts on the one hand , but have to learn the facts aswell .if students understand an idea , they should be able to work the facts out in any case they need them , but only if they know some facts .when a student only learns the facts he will later only know them and might lose the view for the whole topic and thus not being able to anwer the question .he might lose himself in details .it is important to learn the facts aswell as the general idea , because you can not answer a question without having any facts at hand .in case a student only learns the general idea and forgets to learn the facts he opposes the problem of not being able to answer a qouestion once again .he might have understood the whole thing , but is not able to present certain facts that are necessary for explaining a specific topic .therefore an answer wo nt be possible .when a student has learned aswell the general idea and concepts as the facts he should be able to answer every question on a certain topic , without greater problems concerning his preparation .he might have other problems , but they are not to be discussed here .in my past school time i generally learned the facts but sometimes it occurred that i had nt understood the whole idea and concept and therefore a classtest was really bad .if i only had understood the main ideas and concepts but handt learned the facts i was nt usually not able to answer quoestions according to the given task .when i had understood the ideas and concepts and had learned the facts , the classtest was nt a big deal .so i have experienced just what i have stated above .serveral friends of mine have experienced something quite similar .bad grades when they had either only learned the facts or ideas and concepts - good grades when having learned and understood both .thus it is most important for the students to learn the general idea and concepts aswell as to learn the important facts concerning the topic .
