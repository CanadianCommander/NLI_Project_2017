i agree with the author s statement .since ` knowledge is power  says a proverb .so , in today s competitive world it is better to have broader knowledge of all academic subjects .if we have broad idea of lot of subjects , then the chances of oppurtunites increases .if aperson is attended for an interview for a post who is having good subject in various fields will be obviosly selected rather than a person who is specialized in only one field , more over the person with diverse skills will face the interview with confidence .the person with broad knowledge will not essential requires any type of training .but the person knows only one specific subject most probably he must be trained and guided under other matured people in that area .if the person with broader view of subject can easily follow the new trends in the market rather than a person with a little knowledge .although , a person with specialized knowledge in one area can perform very well in his field but he always abondon from tasks which consists other than his subject knowledge .a person knows only a specific subjet fails to perform well if the boom for that field decreases drastically or it is in slum .but there is no such type of problens arises for the person who is good at myriad fields .hence i conclude that a person with broad subject knowledge will always flourish in his field .
