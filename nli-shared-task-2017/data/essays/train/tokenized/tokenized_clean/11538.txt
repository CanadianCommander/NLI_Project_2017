so , how would you feel an elderly person watching a soccer match and shouting at peak of his voice .he has his goggles on , a bear can in hand , and say , england flag painted on him .wo nt you feel a bit annoyed by the scene .yes , its true that every diffrernt age group has a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy .but , it s quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged .just looking at the energy of the youngsters , the ways they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one .the main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy .with body getting older , it tend to loose its energy and even the muscles weakens .when young all the body cellls are young and can store and diliver the maximum energy requied .so with this we can go on traking , dance , jump , play , and many more things .but due to lack of energy elderly people can not enjoy much , especially the things requiring more energy .another good reason supporting my point is , number of options available .you just can not expect an old man to go for cycling round the beach for 10km daily .with sour joints , he has to bring lot many limitations to the kind of work he can do .in contrast , young men and women have many opitions open in the ways they can enjoy .a person fond of biking can go on long ride every week end , or an athlete can have a mounatin traking program set .along with this physically exhaustive joys , a girl willing o dance can take dance lessons and perform whenever she feels down .last in the list , and one of important factors of social life is fear of being caught .with increasing involvement in social life , each has o take care of his image in public .so the ways to enjoy the life get limited down for a man ho has lived much of his life than a yougster .if a company boss is seen freaking around on beach is definitely pointed ou , but , if it s his son is surely admired .thus to conclude with , i can only say that though youngsters have more ways to enjoy life than elder people , one can surely define his enjoyment .defining it we can be happy with what we have , with no greed for what we do nt .
