first of all , we must consider that the two things , learning of concepts and learning of facts , are strictly connected .i think the ideal way for a student to obtain the best result from his studies , is to learn facts and then analyze the ideas and concepts surrounding that fact .for example .it is very important to know the fact that there has been the first world war , but it is necessary to understand which have been the ideas and the reasons which lead to start something highly dangerous and that would have caused thousands of victims .the real problem , i guess , is that is often confused the meaning of `` learning a fact  .during schools , for example , teachers require us to learn by hard dates , names , cities and so on , and this lead to forget the principal fact .moreover , while less important things can be forgotten ( i will not remember the exact day of the end of the frist world war ... ) , the contrary is for the fact .( i will always know that there has been a grat war around 1915 . .. )furthermore , ideas and concepts may be more difficult to understand , but once you do it , it s almost impossible to forget them .besides , they can also change your thoughts , your way of live .they can make you spend your politic vote for one or another party . ..they can lead you to become a politician just to try to change something you learned .it has been the idea of freedom which took gandhi or martin luther king in the political world .it has been the concept of racism which leads me to hate adolf hitler , and not the fact of the second world war .there has been the ideas of ras tafari to give strenght to jamaican people reaching their freedom .in other words : some facts are important ; this is sure .but the learning system should not be based on them !it should be based on motivations and reasons which caused that event and on the ideas that were born by the event .if the system was organized in this way , i think we would have less `` mechaninc  students and more conscious future citizens and politicians .
