in this society , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both important to the students .normally , most of people think first step is to understand ideas and concepts , and then second step is to learn facts , so students can use the ideas and concepts what they understood into learning facts and make it easy to learn .however , for some reasons , i prefer to learn facts is more important for students than to understand ideas and concepts .the main reason is after students learn facts first , their own opinions and questions of the facts will appear in their brain .they may have a different or a similar ideas or concepts of the facts .therefore , after teachers tell students what is the true idea and concepts , they may get the answers of their questions and prove their correct opinions in their mind .it helps students understand the facts in a better and faster way and get to use what they learn in the facts .then , after students learn facts and understand ideas and concepts , they may use what they get in real life easily , and it decrease the probablity of making mistakes .when students are getting to learn facts better and better , they are in their way to understand ideas and concepts at the same time .in fact , understanding and learning have some similar advantages , students will get the ideas and use into the facts at the end anyways .everything depends on the students , like which way is better to them to learn and understand .different people may have different opinions .however , for me , learning facts first contains more advantages than understanding the ideas first .therefore , i agree it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .
