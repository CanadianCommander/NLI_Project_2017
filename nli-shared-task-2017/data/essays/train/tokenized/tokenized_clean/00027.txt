i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i think profit is the most important for almost every company , so when they advertise their products to the customer , the products have to be look nice so that their customer would buy them .in addition , the company should advertise the products nicer and i think this is a part of their job .for example , when vegetables are advertised on the paper , they usually look fresh and clean but not with dirts .brcause the company thinks they would better to advertise the clean ones so that many customers might want to go to the shop and buy them .however , as most people have already experienced like this situation .when you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy , it seems nice to you .but when you actually see the product at the shop , it is not that nice as you were expected and start to complaining .i think this is natural and what you need to do is see before you buy it .if company advertise their products as exactly as it looks , not many people would buy them compare to the situation in the statement .because of these reasons , i agree to the opinion that the most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
