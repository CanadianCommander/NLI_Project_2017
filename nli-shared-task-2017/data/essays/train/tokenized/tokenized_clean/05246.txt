discovery doesnt come from following instructions , it comes from going beyond those instructions and taking risks .for people to be successful they shoud take risks and reach a new point that no one had ever reached .taking risks needs strength and confidence , otherwise the goal will not be reached .the first reason why being successful needs trying new things is that it will open him to new chances and discoveries in life .and the second reason is that the people who will take risks are always brave to do so .when a person takes risks in order to reach a target that he drew in his mind , he will probably be successful .the reason is that those risks will give him a chance to discover his weaknesses and try to improve them , and his strengths as well .so when the person is aware of his weaknesses and strengths he will be able to succeed because those informations will reduse the apportunity to make mistakes .for example , the best student in my class used to follow instructions , and she was not that good , but when she decided to be better , she read alot of books , went places where she got important informations , made a lot of researches , and went to strange places and learned from .now she is the best student in the entire school .taking risks is a speciality of brave people .and brave people are always successful .when a person try new things , he will be special .and being spacial will make the person successful .for example king abdulazez had the braveness to come to saudi and fight and get back his home country , that is why now he is famous and he was so successful when he was alive .in conclusion we can say that success needs taking risks and trynig new thing , because the person will have more chances to try , and he will be brave .with those two thins he will be successful .
