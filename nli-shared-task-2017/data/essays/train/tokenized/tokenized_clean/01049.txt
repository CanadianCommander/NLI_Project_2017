in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .although cars manufacteurs have increased their production the last decades , there is strong reason to assume that there will actually be a lower number of cars in the future than today .this effect will mainly take place through various political measurements .in addition environmental issues , as well as economic considerations will lead to this development .politicies of goverments around the world will lead to a decrease of the number of cars .on one hand goverments will still oppose taxes on petrol and cars .in addition to an contant increase of oil prices cars will become more and more expensive .many people will not be able to effort a car and instead use public transport .the environmantal issue will become more of a problem and urge people not to use cars as they used to .i am confident that awareness for the problems of the environment will change the way of behaviour worldwide .the need for governments ( and other institutions , such as ngos and also the un ) to make environmental-friendly polities will become stronger .this in particually will lead to measures that support public transport , which will make it more attractive to use these means of transport .instable economical developments will also lead to a decrease of total numbers of cars .we will see economical difficulties and even crises .these will have an effect on the distribution of wealth .wealth will be less shared among many people in the future .many people will have a low income .at the same time fewer people will be rich and be able to pay for a car .due to economic uncertainty people will invest less in luxury items , such as a car .because of politcal , environmental and also economic reason there will be fewer cars in twenty .this total number of cars might not change significantly , but still there will not be an increase .
