i strongly believe that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than they just learn them as a fact .i found that important since this is more beneficial for student for their future life .to begin with , while students understunding the ideas and concepts , they begin to set connections between all the ideas they have learned .lets take an mba student .if he understands the different business concepts for a company , he can understand how a whole business works .for example , lets say he take accounting courses and marketing courses .at the end , he should make a connection between them to have a profound idea about that business .if he learns the concepts just a fact , he can not have a broad point of view about that business .moreover , students who learn the concept as a fact tend to forget them much easily than the students understanding concepts .for example , if a student tries to memorize matematical functions , he will most probably forget all those equations in a short time .on the other hand , if a student understand those functions , he will less likely forget them .concequently , i agree that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts .therefore , students should take into account that how they learn makes a real difference .
