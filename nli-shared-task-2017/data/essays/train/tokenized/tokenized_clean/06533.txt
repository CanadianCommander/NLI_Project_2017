in our daily life , more and more entermaint place comes up , most of them are for young people .so there is a debate also coming up we have to face .young people enjoy life more than older people do , is it true ?i have answer already .in fact , when a youny adult and an old man choise the way to enjoy their lives , there is something different between them .the young people have enough energy to play , and even more some sports games with risks , like skatting .it is a pity that old people have not such energy to play crazily as the same as young adults .they can not drink too much because their livers are easily hurt by alchol than young guys .what s more , in many aspects , old men are not able to enjoy like young ones .i believed , when many people were young , some gamble things often happened in our life .with the time flying , less and less risks would be taken when we are becoming older .i think the reason why that can happen is that the passion is lost with the ages .i think sometimes , the gamble things can bring us more passion and more happiness .unforturnetly , the old people does not think so .they think safety is more important than anything , which makes things faint .in morden today , more and more entertamant place are designed for young people .why ?because the wise companies catch the chance to attract young people , not older people , which represents young people can bring more economic development for the society than older people .that s also why young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are abound life for young guys .in a word , i agree about that young people enjoy life more than older people do .whatever any aspects , young guys can feel more happiness than older ones as the result of having a more younger heart .
