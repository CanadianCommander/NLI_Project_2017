in my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts as only learning facts .because learning facts is not the elementary problem .if they understand the main problem in general , it is easier to learn the facts , because they have enough scientific background .additionally , if they understand the scientific concepts and models , they do not need so much help , for example from teachers .the students can learn in self studies and answering their questions themselves by analzying the problem .the students have to learn how they can solve such problems .this is what the universities and schools wants to show the students .because in real life are too much facts .nobody can learn all these facts , because there is not enough timeand it will be very inefficient .so scientifics wants to formulate general concepts that are based on an important idea and developing a model , on which they can show the facts of the real world .these are the basics of research .the scientific result based on researching activities comes form an idea of the researcher .if the students learn these concepts and models they can use them for other situations and they will get new facts .the understanding of these models and concepts summarizes a lot of information and facts .it is very efficient to use such concepts and models and understand the main ideas they are based .
