life comes only once , hence one must enjoy each and every moment in his life , and live without that voice in the back of his mind that says i didnt enjoy his life one as much as i should have had .life is like a flower which has to bloom and which wants to enjoy in the sun .youth is the stage in life when one has the time of his life .at youth the young man is full of energy , at a tender age he spend most of his time playing with dolls , drawing or anything which amuses him .then in teenage , young people enjoy amongst their friend circle .not only that these young people will try to enjoy each and every time of their life by doing the most absurd things which one cant even ever think of , like me when i was young - me and my friends would occasionally ring the bells of our neighbours and run away .every one in his life might have done something or the other equally thrilling in their lives .if you look at it you will mostly believe that ones enjoying days are only during the youth , but who said that old people can not enjoy ?their lives arent over they still can have fun .take my grandparents for example .just because they are old doesnt mean that they can not have fun .my grandparents still enjoys by visiting place which they couldnt at young age because of education .although i know that due to these illustrations it seems that young people have an edge over the young ones with respect to enjoyement and if i were questioned if `` young people enjoy life more that olden people do  , then i would say thats a difficuly question my friend , the older people had an equally enjoyed when they themselves were young , similarly to the young ones , i would say enjoyement isnt over for you guys as yet , u have the rest of ur life to live ...
