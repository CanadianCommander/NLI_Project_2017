science-fiction movies depict a future , where there are no cars in the streets because it is subsituted by teleportation .although it is mere fantasy and a funny expectation at the moment , some people think that cars will vanish or their numbers will be reduced in twenty years .i do not agree with this statement partly because cars have become a part of our daily life .more importantly they have become a part of our modern life .mobility is an important feature in today s world since it offers escape from our daily routine , which is essential for refueling energy to ourselves to continue living .another reason is due to the market large corporations have at the present and they will not be willing to lose this market .the first aspect why cars will not become unpopular in near future is due to their strong impact in our lives .in this modern day , we do everything using cars : we drop and get our children from school using cars , we go out to entertain ourselves with our cars .with the movement to the suburbs , we need to go to the shopping mall and get our weekly needs .other than that , families in suburbs are usually isolated , and their only escape is gained through going out with their cars .in city life , we have to use cars too due to the fact that city has a fast life and we have to adapt to it .another point regarding cars is that they offer us an escape from the daily routine , which is something we need for continuing working .some might argue that we already spend time in cars in our daily routine .however , a car and an open road is usually associated with freedom and escape .in today s world , leaving our daily routine for a few days is considered as a way to feel ourselves comfortable and relaxed : we go on vacations using our cars or go for a picnic at the weekends .as in seen in the movie thelma and louise , where two women go away from their houses for the weekend for a change since this is neccessary to go on living .the market car producers have at the moment is another aspect why cars will not be outnumbered by other vehicles .since there is a big market for producers to sell their cars to consumers , producers will find a way to keep cars popular .to examplify , in the city - ankara where i have been living since i was born , there have been a great increase in the number new of cars in the traffic .this fact that i notice everydays shows that cars have not lost their popularity .on the contrary , more cars have been sold in the last few years than in earlier times .this is partly because car producers are conforming to today s needs by changing the outlook of the cars .in other words , they will not lose popularity , but the way they work will change .some people believe that there will be less cars than there are today in twenty years .i do not agree with this statement because cars have become a part of our daily modern lives , and we do every little thing using them .additionally , cars function as an escape from the daily routine of life to the people , who are exhausted in their daily lives and in need of energy .moreover , car producers have a big market of consumers , which is something that producers will never want to lose .
