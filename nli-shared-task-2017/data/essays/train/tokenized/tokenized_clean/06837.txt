i completely agree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having a broad knowlege of many subjects will give a lot of exposure , new subjects will create interests and also provide better career prospects for students .students will gain a lot of exposure by studying many different subjects .this will also prepare them to take classes in different departments .i personaly feel that this is a very good option as this will make them interact with other students coming from different backgrounds as well gain valuable knowledge .moreover , studying a wide variety of subjects will help students develop new interests that they might eventually take up and make a career of it .let me support this with an example .while i was studying `` architecture  we were asked to take a wide variety of subjects like interior design , lanscaping , theory of structures , humanities and history of architecture .while studying these subjects i developed a lot of interest in the subject of `` history of architecture  which eventually i went on to make a career in it .today i am working with the `` national heritage conservation committee  as a architect guiding the govenment about the various teachniques and means to protect the heritage and historical monuments .lastly this also creates better career prospects for students as a lot of prospective employers and firms want to recruit people who have a broad knowledge about a lot of subjects in their respective field .as their knowledge tremendeously helps them in a lot of projects where such inputs are required and turn it into success !for example a student with a broad knowledge of `` sustainable design  and project management will definately have an edge over a student with knowlege only in `` interior design  .thus it is important for students to have a broad knowledge of amny academic subjects instead of specializing in one specific one and i completely agree with it .
