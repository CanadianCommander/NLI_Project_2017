cars , which are considered as means of necessity now a days , were considered as luxury in 1950 s and 1970 s .people since 1970 has increased using cars because they stand for prestige .the present topic is use of cars in twenty years , whether there will be more or few cars in use .there are both advantages as well as disadvantages of using car .advantages could be 1 ) economical , as the whole family could travel at the same time and costs less when compared to the expenses of travelling by train or bus .2 )second advatnage could be halting or taking rest when wanted .the disadvanatges could be 1 ) pollution , 2 ) increasing traffic , 3 ) more accidents .now-a-days , people in cities like london , tend to leave their cars at home and prefer travelling by train to their destinations and this probably could be due to increased traffic , which delays people from commitments .so i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .the second point that inclines me to take the side of the statement is pollution .most of the people are suffering with respiratory diseases like asthma , chonic bronchitis and for this pollution could be blamed partly .people who lived all their lives working in bigger cities tend to retire in country side to avoid air and sound pollution .so this could be one of the reason that in future use of cars will be lowered .the third point which supports my decision regarding fewer cars in use in twenty years is obesity and physical fitness .people are more bothered about their physical fitness as they are busy with the work and ca nt exercise in leisure time .so as a matter of fact most people to improve and maintain physical fitness ride bikes to work than using cars .so to conclude , with all the above reasons there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
