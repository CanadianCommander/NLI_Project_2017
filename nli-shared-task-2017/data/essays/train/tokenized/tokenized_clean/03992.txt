i agree that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars than there are today .owing to the over-crowding of roads and highways and lack of enough parking spaces in large-cities and the global warming effects due to the fuel-missions , authorities concerned in advanced countries around the world would plan on taking of a lot of cars off the road or atleast reduce their numbers as such .cars consume too much fuel , fuel in the form of kerosense , petrol , diesel .and their natural resouces like the crude-oil reserves are fast depleting .so , the number of cars are more likely to be decreased in a few years down the lane in order to cut down the fuel consumption .countries/nations would invest in building rail road infrastructure and build a wider and larger sophisticated network of railroads for inter-city and intra-city connections .this will happen in 20 years from now .rail roads provide very efficient public transportation and this option naturally replaces cars .public transportation like fuel efficient buses , trams will increase so as to serve the society s transportation needs and hence people are less likely to be inclined to fancy themselves with a new car .bicycles , tri-cycles offer a very eco-friendly alternative as a personal mode of transportation for travelling lesser distances .traffic problems due to too many cars on the highways is viewed very cautiously by the dept of transportation in many cities .so , the only solution to cut down the traffic during peak times is to discourage people to buy cards and encourage public transportation like bus , trams , commuter-trains .air-travel will increase and there will be airports at most smaller towns and cities and this enable people to reach their destinations faster .airline network will be increased with better connections and better flights to serve the passengers needs in twenty years from now .scientists have already spoken a lot about the deleterious effects of global warming which is caused due to the dangerous fuel emissions from the cars .so , to check this , governments will plan , strategise and draft a plan to find global solutions to this problem .this will result in fewer cars in 20 years from now .cars may however remain a main mode of personal/family transportation now , but in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use which would result in a better enviroment across the globe and the world will be a lot cleaner and healthier .
