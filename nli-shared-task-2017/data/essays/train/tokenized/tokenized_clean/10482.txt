the statement says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .we dont know for sure whether this statement is true or not .twenty years is a long time , and anything can happen .with all the new technologies that are being invented everyday , it is possible to have fewer cars in twenty years .today , we see that there are too many cars being manufactured than the amount that is needed .in kuwait for example , every house has about two to three cars , if not more .having too many cars can cause disasters .as a result , more accidents will occur , and people would have to leave their homes earlier because of any traffic or accidents that would cause them to be late .in twenty years , we could have flying cars , or a different trasportation system that would result in less cars .more people might start using other forms of transportations .in my opinion , i believe that there should be less cars in use , and that people should use other forms of transportation to get from one place to another .some other forms of transportation are the use of buses , subways , or carpooling .if more people used buses and subways , there would be less cars in use .carpooling is also a good method that can be used to reduce the amount of cars in use today .if there was a rule stating that each car should have a minimum of three people , less cars would be in use .in conclusion , a possible solution is that in the future , people would realize the amount of money they are spending on gas , and how dangerous driving has become .and who knows how much gas will be available in twenty years .
