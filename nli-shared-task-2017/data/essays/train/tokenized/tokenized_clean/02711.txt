i have experiemced a situation many times when i was disappointed by the actual usefullness of a productb compared to the advertisement on the televisions .most advertisements truly make products seem much better than they really are .we see many kinds of advertisements on almost every channnel on television , such as laundry soap which makes dirty laundries exreamly white or jerm killing spray which killes all the jerms in three seconds .almost all products have catchy phrase and a song that goes with it which makes us want to try it at least once .in japan , tv advertisements play a big part in the society .they have ring tones of a particular advertisement songs that we can download or t-shirts that have a character of a specific character of a product .they are part of our life , and we are often unaware that we are actually advertising those products .because television advertisements play a huge part in japan , people who make the advertisements end up focusing on the `` side effects  rather than the actual usefullness of affection of a product .also , the company which makes advertisements focus more on the `` looking  of the product than of the actual taste of the usefullness of the product or a dish , because their job is to gather peoples  attention as much as possible .when advertising something , it is important to make sure that it looks good and attractive .but we always have to be aware that they are sometimes over exaggerating .
