it s quite common to hear judgment about young people nowadays .it s even quite popular the idea that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else life .well , i think it s the way adults use to solve some their internal problems , completely not tied with what the reality is .the reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time to helping their community than before , and i think this habits will increase in the future .the modern life has brougth us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can : or better , in order to earn as much as we can .this behaviur entay an important aspect : the rising of a new concept of common culture .what i want to say is that now every young people is enough preperred to understand that is better to work and to make efforts for the community instead of behaving selfishly .any good action can only improve the common happyness , but our happyness is just inside this commonwealth .it s even more and more evident how young people are trying destroy old stereotypes of thinking about what is defferent .although until few years ago hostile behaviours among human races were deep radicated in common thinking , new social dynamics are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference .thus making easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community ; and it s this new sense of belonging to make us spend more time with this new family .anyway the elevate number of young people involved in volunteer group , such as medical team in poor area of the word or even very young people helping in housekeeping elders , is a confirm of what i ve stated .in conclusion , i can even well understand why many adults think that most of young people ar poor in sprit : are not them to teach us in university classes that yhe only god we must pray is money ?and the only way to earn money is nt time ?
