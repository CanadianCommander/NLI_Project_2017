advertsiment has been one of the foremost discussion issue in my country as in many parts of the world in the last few decades .altough some people do not think advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , dominant people think vice versa .according to the dominant people companies think their own budget , so their advertisemnts do not show true products .and i also think like dominant people .one of the crucial reasons for my belief is companies behave selffishly and they do not think the customer price .companies show their products more attractive .that is why people want to buy this things .and as the time passes people are able to understand this products are not useful and beautiful as much as shown in the advertisement .another reason for my belief is , people always want to have much more attractive products .especially nowadays people do not think their needs instead they almost think atractiveness .in addition to this , companies know this situataion beacuse of this they advertise their product much better than they really are .thus , this situation is good for both side , companies and customers , nobody complane from this situation .the last but least reason is that , companies always compete with each others for having much more reputation .due to this reason they always want to show their products more useful and more qualty as well as more attractive .hence , they want to advertise their products more efficiently .moreover , sometimes products are not related with real ones .taking the points i have mentioned above into consideration , it would be appropriate to say that companies use advertisement to have a bigger pforit .in addition to this , they use customers to acchieve their aims .companies think selffishly , and they use people s feelings which about the having more attractive products as well as they reflect their competitions to customers .all of these reasons i strongly hold the idea of advertisement make products seem much better than really are .
