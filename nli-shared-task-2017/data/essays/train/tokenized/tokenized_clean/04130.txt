i ca nt agree with the statement .in my opinion .in the future , there will be more cars in the world even though there are some tasks to solve .at first , we need to concerntrait on the natural resources .the human beings are used it without a long term vision , so they will be almost used up in next 20 years .but , there are lots of studies which try to find another energy sources .for examole , gain oil from natural grains , using sun energy , and using the wind .the most interesting thing is hydrogen .it s source is water which is really fruent in earth .( actually , the hydrogen cell is only meterial problem now . )so , human being will find another energy resources in twenty years , i sure .second , china , africa , and india will have lots of cars in 20 years .as you know they did nt boot their real economic engins .as many economic specialist says , they will have rapid grow .so , they will have a lot of new cars .at last , like a hybrid technaligy there are many methodes which can enhance the efficiency of cars .the more cars means the more happiness in the world ?the more advance in technaligies means the more happiness ?i ca nt answer the questions .a important thing is we have to a master of technaligies , in my think .thank you for reading . .
