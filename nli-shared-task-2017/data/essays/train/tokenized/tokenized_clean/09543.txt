will there be fewer cars on road twenty years later than there are today ?this is complex and controversial question .but in my opinion , i do agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .my opinion will be proved by following discussion .first of all , the traffic jam .traffic jam already became a serious problem in any large cities in the world .for example , shanghai , it will take you 2 hours to go 3 miles during the peak time .government tried to build more roads but still can not meet the requirement .the solution is the rail way transportation system .this is also the solution for many other cities in the world .take subway , you can control the time accurately and will not waste your time on road .if more and more people take the public transportation system such as subway , there will less cars on road .secondly , the environment protection .more and more people and governments in this world already awared that protect our environment is protecting our selves .also , more and more people select other transportation systems such as bicycle , electrical powered trains and solar powered systems instead of a car .people is choosing not to use cars as possible as they could .this trend means that there will be less cars on road in future than there are today .third , resource shortage and government policy .as we know that the price of the oil always keep going up recently .this is because the oil has already became the shortage resource .if the price continue going up , less people could affort the consumption of oil and will stop use the car .also , to solve the traffic jam problem and resource shortage problem , the governments will issue different kind of policies to limited the use of car .for example , raise the tax of car and oil , or raise the car license fee which already selected by shanghai government few years ago .people have to pay extra money to support a car in future .this will force a lot of people not to use the car .in the end , base on above mentioned reasons , we could draw the conclusion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
