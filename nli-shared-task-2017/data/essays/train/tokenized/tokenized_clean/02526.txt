to my mind the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars on our streets than today is totally incorrect because there are a lot of ambivalent arguments that prove the opposite opinion .of course , there are some points that would admit such a theory , for example modern technology .our public transport systems are getting better and will improve within the next twenty years to possibilities we can hardly imagine today .computerbased , full automatical systems are already a topic in research .besides this it is a fact that our population in germany decreases and that our society is getting older .as a result we will have less drivers and older drivers who usually do not drive their cars very often in twenty years .this development of course effects a reduction of cars on our streets .on the other hand there are enough facts to come to another conclusion .our society will become more and more mobile .a husband for example living in the ruhr area with his wife and his children becourse of his wife s job or his children s school will have to drive by car when he gets a job offer in hamburg .this case is not unusual today and will appear more and more in the future .people have to be flexible and therefore mobile .you can reach this creteria only when you have an own car .furthermore we are living in a very service oriented society .everyone wants to have everything as soon as possible .therefore you need a great ammount of cars to provide people with their daily needs .as i mentioned above our society is getting older and old people probably wo nt have the opportunity to by all what they need .so they have to be delivered with foods or clothings or medicine by cars .that is why i do not agree to the statement .maybe in 100 years the situation will be different but that nobody k
