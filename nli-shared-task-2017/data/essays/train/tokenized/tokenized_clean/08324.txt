knowledge is one of the most important things a person can gain throughout his lifetime experience .it can be considered as the tool to be used throughout his life in order to prove himself as an effective person in his soceity and surrounding .some people believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject , and others believe the opposite .i personally agree with this statement since having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can further strengthen the person s personality and broaden his horizons .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help the person improve his thinking skills and his creative vision .i strongly believe that all areas of knowledge complete each other , so if a person knows about math , science , history , art , music , language and other areas of knowledge , he will be able to view life and its different situations in a better way than a person who is narrow minded by only one specific subject .although some people may think that speicalizing in one specific subject can be better , since the person get to have a closer look at the subject and get hold of every single detail of it and become an expert in it , i believe that in order to become a better person and improve different dimensions of one s personality , the person should experience different situations and different ways of knowledge that will all help in the building of one s thoughts and beliefs .when thinking of that subject , i actually realise how effectively the international baccalaureat dimploma program has helped me gain a vast and broad knowledge of many academic subjects and areas of knowledge , which have surely helped me build my personality and become a better critical thinker and a well rownded person .finally , i belive that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very important , but not to forget the fact that if one has a certain area of knowledge he/she is interested in , there is no problem in learning more about it and going into its details as long as a broad knowledge of the various areas of knowledge and issues is present at the same time .
