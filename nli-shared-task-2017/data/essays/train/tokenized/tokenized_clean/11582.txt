car industry is one of the biggest industry of the world today .car are part of the daily life of people all over the world .i do nt know how many people takes their car every morning to reach their job location ?so , for sure i can not imagine our society without cars today . ..but in twenty years ?to try to answer to this problematic i will first hightlight the reasons why i think it s possible to have fewer cars in use in twenty years .then i will focus on the opposite argument .first we can consider that with the development of other transportation industries like planes , trains , buses etc . ..people will more and more use these transports instead of their car .this will be probably more true for people who lives in big cities .for example , in mexico city , you may take 4 hours to cross the city from the north to the south .but if you use the buses or subways network , one hour could be enough . ..so what i would like to demonstrate is that the use of the car could be a drawback in such situation and i think that people will be more and more aware about that .the other factor that can influence people to use less their car is the competitive prices of other transportations .for example , with the low cost companies you can go and go back from paris to milano by plane for around 50 us dollars .secondly , i have to admit that even if new opportunities to move from a point to another one are increasing and will continue to , people like and need to have their own car .i will take two examples to show how i imagine the way the cars in use will increase .for instance , in france ( but i guess it s the same in most countries ) , people are more and more living in the suburbs or big citties .they think the quality of the life there is better .but with this new way of life , they will for sure need to use their car to go to the center of the city where their job is , but also the supermarket etc . ..the second example i would like to give you is a mexican example .in mexico , you use cars to show your social level .so most of the rich mexican people owns more than one car .they have a car to go at work , a car to go out , a car to do shopping etc . ..but mexico will be probably more developed in twenty years , that means more wealthy people and so more cars in use . ..so , from my point of view , in twenty years we will propably be able to decrease the number of cars in use , but due to the social life amd the habits of people it will be impossible .to conclude i will say that even if i do nt believe it will be possible in twenty years , i really hope that it would be in the future . ..we need to preserve our environment . .
