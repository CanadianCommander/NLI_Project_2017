some people say that learning facts without the understand are more important becase these days is information social .however , i disagree about it .there are a reason : if we do not understand idea , we can not use them .sometimes , we are required many information from modern society when we want to do something like writing a report an so on .absolutly , we can use it without understand ideas and concepts but we can not use that those are natually .in this case , i think that it is same we do nt know it .for example , my classmate , haemi kim , is a student in the columbia university alp .she wanted to write about a globle warming when she took an essay test .even though she has known it , she has not understood this topic .while she was writing an essay , she could not writing anything .so , she failed the test and then she had to prepare another exam .if she figure out this subject , she could pass the exam .that is a point , if we do nt understant someting , we do nt know it .as a result , when we learn somethig , we have to understand what is the meaning because when we need to use the information , we can be more comfortable than we do nt understand it .
