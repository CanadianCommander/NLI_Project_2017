some people hold that it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .as far as i am concerned , i d like to take a neutral stand on this issue .my opinions go as follows .in the first place , with no doubts , the society aspires talents who have comprehensive knowledge of many academic subjects .for instance , in some companies , a secretary is expected to perform not only in administration , but also in related areas such as banking , accounting , marketing and hr .nowadays it s not uncommon that more and more companies , in order to acquire more profits , often cut back costs on the number of staff .making one staff do the work of two or even three is not unusual .employees at work are expected to be equipped with broad knowledge , so that they can perform in all areas .as we all know that to do well at work , you have to be an all-rounder .many people have been aware that language command and computer skills all have become common tools , all modern people need to know how to use a computer .we have to admit that a lawyer who could speak english and has good computer knowledge can do better than his or her counterpart who does not speak a foreign language .however , in certain fields , people need to be specialized in one specific subject .this is especially true in science and technology field .to do well in a certain field , people have to be specialized in it .especially those students who take doctorate degrees , some are specifically in glass , some in optic fibre .in my opinion , even an accountant can do very well if he or she gets only specialized in accounting .we need to be objective in this issue .depends on what field you are in and what job you are taking , either has no harm .
