are young people happier than older ones ?i think that this statement is the sad reality .we ll quickly see the arguments on the paperfirstly , young people have much more occasions to make new friends than old people .if you go out every week , if you re invited at your friends  places twice a week , your chances to meet new people are amazingly high .the truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you re relatively youngbesides as a young personn you are not as involved in your family life as your parents might be .you can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duties you need to do back home .studying abroad is an opportunity you ca nt miss .with the increase of links between the earth nations it has became easier to study abroad than before .as a result , today students have much more chances to go in a foreign country than their parents had .proof of this point the increasing students demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationships that universities maintain together .last but not least , old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely .it s not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want as long as they are good at school at the end .a young guy can relax as much as he want .he even can leave school if he does nt like it .an adult can not afford it .he can not chill out because someone is counting on him : the young personn .to conclude , i would like to say that we mus nt be blind , there are too many arguments in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious .life is better when you are young .
