what are you going to do if you won the lotery ?most people have fantesy world in their maind and every body has own idea of live .some of them will go in vecation for the rest of live other will be egar to do more and try to make new goal .for me i would like to countenu working and trying new things because to be more successful in my life three reasonsfirst , good experience is the most important point ever time we look for a new job .that makes it the most important point to try new thing even if we think we will make mistake .i believe that we all learn more from mistake than other .second , every things start with firest time .for example , to like new food we have to try it first .trying a new thing is the key for us to like new job or carrer .third , most of successful people live in many plases before they start to work in this case they make their live more easy .make our live more exsited and enterasted by trying new thing .in conculsion , success needs more than doing one thing good .for me i like to try new things to get new experince , .
