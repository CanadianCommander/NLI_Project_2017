nowaday , the compition between the companies become more and more seriose .every company want to find the best way to reach the customer .one of the best way to reach them is the advertisement .in my openion , even though the advertisment is important to sell the products and to let the consumer know about it , i believe that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .if we take loosing wieght as an example .every day you will see diffrenet advertisement about the diet food or about kinds of exercises or even opening new gym .you can see this advertisement almost everywhere .in the street , tv , and movies . ..ets .however , if this product like they says it is the fastest and the easiest way to loss wieght so why there are more and more products about loosing wieght ?and why the fat people are increasing everyday ?some of this advertisments are not honest .they present a person as an example in the advertisement about how is the product is useful .however , in the real life there is no related between the product and this person , and he is just an actor .for example , my friend has a soft skin since she was child ; however , many cream companies tried to convinced her to show in thier advertisment and say her soft skin comes from this product .in addition , the advertisment uses a famouse person and how he uses the product and again in the real life meybe you will find that thefamouse person did not try the product before .in short , the company in order to sell thier products or serveses , they have tried whatever they can to sell this products .therefore , i really think many advertisment do not reflect the reality , and there is a differences between the advertisement and the reality .
