i agree with the statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide , but not always , as for the statement , there are advantages and disadvantages .starting with the advantages , going with a group of people and a tour guide will prevent you from being lost , or even being stolen .also it is much more fun to go with a group , like a group of friends or mates from a certain class .as a matter of fact , staying alone will also increase the danger for an individual because he might get stolen or robbed .but there are also certain disadvantages for a tour with a group with a tour guide , althought it will be fun , it might be much expensive than touring individually , but also any person will just feel dependent on the tour guide , or even if he has a certain job to go by himself he will face trouble and how to start like booking a hotel , renting a car , going to a resturant , also he wo nt be able to discover something new , like he wo nt be able to make friends , nor he will be able to talk to anyone except if he was alone or with a partner ,in my opinion , i would prefer to go for the first time with a group and a tour guide , and then when i will be familiar with the place i think i would try to go alone and figure everything by myself because it will taste differently .in addition to going alone , going with a group of friends is really exciting , as i had tried it once when we went with my friends to europe for vacation , althought we had nt a tour guide but it was fun exploring things alone and trying them , and looking at the fine places , and by asking you can reach any place you want to reach .
