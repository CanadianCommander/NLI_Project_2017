advertisements are everywhere : in the streets , at work , at home on tv and on the radio .they intend to make products seem good and cajole the consumers into buying their products .however sometimes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and betray the consumers .first , one should not forget that the purpose of an advertisement is to show the bright side and the advantages of a product .for instance a car company will show in its advertisement how fast its car is or how safe it is .however the advertisment will not mention intentionally the drawbacks of the product .the fact that this last proposal would sound ridiculous to anybody highlights the fact that we are all aware of the purpose of an advertisement .therefore if one advertisement insists on the velocity of a car it may not speak about safety because this is not a important characteristc of the car .it then appears that most advertisements doe not lie , however they only show the high skills or advantages of the product and sometimes it can make the product seem much better than it really is if the consumer does not consider the possibiliy of drawbacks .moreover , some advertisements do not only lack information on possible defaults of the product , but they intend to make the consumer forget all those default by emphasizing so much on the qualities of the product .there are many ways to hypnotise the consumers .for instance some advertisements would repeat an incredibly large number of times the same moto , which generally says `` this product is the best  or `` you ca nt be happy without this product  .this is nearly lying since they the company generally can not prove its product is the best , maybe the more sold but not the best .a lot of advertisments for cleaning products are based on this principle .they compare the efficiency of their product with an `` unknown  product , but we no nothing of this `` unknown  product .thus in this case it is not difficult to be the best .in conlcusion , a lot of advertisements take advantage of the consumers  naive beliefs and make products seem much better than they really are .their purpose in this case is not only to show the good aspects of one product but to incite the consumer to buy one product he does not need or he does not know about .
