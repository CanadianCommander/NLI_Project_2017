`` human mind has always had the unsatisfying hunger for knowledge  .we always try to grasp the things going around him us the nature .we tried to better understand our environment or surroundings by observing and learning from it .it is this compulsion to learn everything that lead us to the stage we are now .without the spirit of the man to study everything he sees we would not have made the advancement in our social life .having the broader knowledge about many academics is better in some ways because knowledge about one subject leads to the better understanding about other subjects .as in the case of physics and math .the subject of physics would look like a japanese to an amatuer if he does not have the background of math because every calculation done in physics involves math .as goes for some other subjects too .specialization in one subject involves intensive training in specific area of field .people taking up specialization only on a particular subject would have limited knowledge about other subjects .the would be doing research only on the given field and there would be no scope to further increase his knowldge about other fields .but having the knowledge about other subjects would be quite useless too sometimes .such as in the case of students doing their college .if a history student is asked to gain his knowledge in physics it would be quite useless , because he would be confused about his future , whether he would end up working as a physicist or a historian .it would rather deviate the mind of the student from his main ambition .take for instance many great scientists and researchers who have contributed immensely in their respective fields because of the liking they had for they subjects .therefore it is better to have a specialization in only one academic subject because it helps determining the future of the students taking it .as to what they would really become in the future .it also generates the interest in the student so as to expand his knowledge to the core of the subject .
