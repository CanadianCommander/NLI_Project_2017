i completely agree with statment that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there can be exceptions but in general younger people are tend to enjoy more on account of their high energy levels and will to live life to it s fullest .younger people are more energetic , fit , enthusastic , experimental , sporty in nature and more excited towards events of life they are facing or they are going to face .on the other hand older people are compratively not much enthusiastic because of ill fitness , lack of energy , lack of will to do things .fed up from their problems .they do not prefer experimentation or adventure .when i was of age 6 i always wanted my grandfather to run with me , run my bicycle .he used to refuse and he used to see my enjoyment by riding bicycle .i used wonder why he is not being part my happiness my enjoyment .but later i realised i grew up that he was heart patient and could not afford to run and enjoy like i did .age , diseases made him weaker and he was refused to do even simple things that he wished to enjoy .younge people can do whatever they wish and this is treasure of happiness .if one wishes to climb the hill one need to think about it .but this is nt case when it comes to older people .energy , fitness anr not the only things .willpower is lacking in older people .i had one professor who used to teach me langauge calles `` sanskrit  .he was always in demand to give lectures , teaching students .but now he is 88 and `` sanskrit  is something he sepnt his life for .he is very fit for his age .but still he is not able to teach students and give lectures even at renowed universities because he do not have that same willpower .he can ot enjoy something he did for his whole life .younge people on contrary can go and party late , they can play , they can race , they can climb mountains .they have willpower to acheive something in life .they can try their level best with energy and will and can enjoy their success .youngsters have broader vies towards society so they can enojoy what they get without any conflict .i know my borther who parties every night , goes on trekking every alternate sundays , get good marks , gets success out of whatever he wants to do .but in same home he lives , his grandmother can not enjoy beyond going to temples and to meet some relatives .also younger people can take defeat is something which will make them emotionally strong while older take is as failure .that takes the enjoying of winning away from them .confidence , will , energy these are key points of happiness .and unfortunately olders don not have them compared to younge people .so i think youngsters enjoy life more than olders do .
