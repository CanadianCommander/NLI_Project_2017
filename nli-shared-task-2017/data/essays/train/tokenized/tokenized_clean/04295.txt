i disagree with this statement because i guess that in the future there will be a lot different cars because the industry will produce more different models of cars and the people will be attracted by evolving future technology .nowdays the governments are making a lot efforts , but not enough in my opinion , to fight the pollution , and one of these is to give economical support to someone buying electric cars that doesn  t damage the enviroment .for this reason i believe that a lot of people will be needed to buy new cars and will be attracted by new futuristic models .another important reason of the car  s number increase in twenty years is that the people , like today , will consider to own a very nice car as status symbol and will try to demonstrate to each other to be the most actractive and respectful person only for having a beatiful car .furthermore another aspect that we have to consider , is that our society will be always more sedentary because the people will not tolerate to go to work or shopping by public transport and will like rather than moving towards the downtown driving a very new car with all optionals in order to show to other people .i think that this aspect is very stupid but i see every day this behavior and i guess that it will not change .in conclusion i believe that the number of cars will be greater than today , and we will have always more enviromental probems , and the traffic and car accidents will increase .this is my pessimistic view of the future
