enjoing life is not related to the age of the person but on the interst of the person .many young and old people enjoy their life but in different ways .now adays many young and old poeple enjoing their life because of the avaliability of many facility like tranning centers , theaters , golfe courses , libaries , shoping centers and ect which is located every where and it is open all the day .so regardless of the age people could schadual their time according to their daily commetments and enjoy these places .young poeple enjoy the new technology more than the old poeple because they have more knowledege and more intrest in this kind of life style .for example , my children enjoy playing vidio games and watching movies and tchating in the internet with their friends and when i discuss it with them they use to say that this is our time and this technology developed during our time and we have to enjoy it .on the other hand i dont enjoy playing vedio games and watching movies every week or even every second week because i do not have the interst in these kind of things .students in the university and collages travel more than the old people and they want to explore many things .some times they stop their courses in the university and travel to different parts of the world to enjoy their life .i think enjoing of life have nothing to do with age but it dependes on the person s interst and what life enjoenment means to him .
