i agree with the statment that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .if i think about my past when i was younger .i can remember the idea that my friends and i had about helping our communities .we used to spent at least few hours a week to provide services and help people that were in some kind of trouble .naturally our help was related with our age , but it was a good way to teach us the sense of community .nowadays i can see in many different occasion that young people are more selfish , they think just about themself and what is the best thing to do just for themself .during last years i have never met a young person that was giving some of his time to do something helpfull for the community .in our modern society there are many thing that everybody should do for the benefit of our community , and some of them should be done expecially by young people .for example they should spent part of their time staying with old peolple and help them .i think this is a good way to learn the history and get a sense of responsability .i remember that i used to do that expecially with all my grandparents , and i learnd many things from them .nowadays young peolpe prefer to stay with their friends maybe waisting time or doing something really useless .probably there are different reasons why young peolpe have this kind of attitude , but i think that the most important reason is related with their parents .i think they forgot wich are the most important values in a sociaty .they also did not teach what a kid should do for his growing and how relate with the community .i am sure that if i will have a children i will teach him how to give his help to his community and how to relate with it .
