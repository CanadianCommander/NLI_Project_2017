what are academic subjects ?does specializing in one specific subject help ?or is it better to have a broader knowledge about various subjects ?knowledge is like an ocean .there are various unlimited subjects .most of us choose our subjects according to our interests and preference .choosing a subject plays an important role in everyones life and thus an individual should make a clear dicission .the role choosing a specific subject played in my sisters life and the rapid change in the technology helped me realize that choosing a specific subject is very important in todays world .my sister is specialized in computer science engineering .she did her graduation and post graduation in only one subject .now as a result many companies are willing to give a high paid job .she was interested right from her chilhood days in the field of computers .so because of her consistant approach towards the subject helped her to reach her goals and ambitions .the technology today is accelerating .there are many new discoveries and innovations in the field of science and technology .to catch up with the pace of this change one should constantly concentrate in any particular field .this would intern help him/her to participate to make new innovations in any particular field .this process would help in nation building .therefore , i personally want to specialize in the field of computers like my sister and also be a part of innovating new technological systems .thus specializing in any particular subject helps an individual to know the subject in detail and more specifically .so this is the main reason i choose to select any particular suject and specialise in it .
