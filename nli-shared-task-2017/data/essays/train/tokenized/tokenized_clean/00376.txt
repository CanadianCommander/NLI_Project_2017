when i think of tv commercials , catalogs , and advertisements in a town , i certain agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the purpose of advertisements is promoting the products  sales .therefore , i think it is a natural sequence that advertisements try to make prtoducts seem better as much as possible .therefore , customers should be aware of the nature of advertisements and should carefully examine the products before purchase .however , this nature of advertisements has become a growing concern today .it has been for a while since catalog shoppings started , and online shoppings have been significantly increasing lately .customes can not look closely at or touch products before perchase on catalog and online shoppings .if advertisements make products look too much better than they are really are , customers may regret the purchase when they have the products in their hands .i often see this situation happens around me .i think it relies on the marketing strategies and also moral of sellers how much better advertisements are allowed to make products seem .sellers definetely should provide as detailed written information as possible other than `` a nice picture .sellers also may need to provide the information that customers often misunderstand about the product .sellers who are sincere about their products eventually attain customers  trust , and become a winner in the field of products , hopefully .
