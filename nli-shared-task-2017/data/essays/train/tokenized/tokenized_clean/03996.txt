i disagree this statement .although we do not need to consider about the schedule , we may loose the chance to talk with poeple who live in the tour place .i think it is one of the interesting incidents we have some opprtunities to talk with such as people .recently , there are a number of tours which is planed by tour companies .most of these tour is led by tour guide .parhaps , we have to go the places where we do not want to go , because the other members want to go .i think one of the reasons we go to travel is to separate from our own society .sometime we want to escape from the societies which we belong to .however , if we go to a tour led by a tour guide , we may travel with the other poeple who applyed the same tour .in this situation , we have to construct new society while we travel .if we could not get along with the other poeple who take part in the same tour , we might be tired , in conparison .in addition , the one of the interest thing about travel is planning the tour course , in advance .i think travel starts when we decided to go .no matter how tour guide construct the tour which is suitable for us , we become to loose one of the intrest thing of trip .for these reasons , we should travel by ourself rather than led by a tour guide .i would like to fun the quality of tour from planning , when we start , where we go , how we go and with who we go .
