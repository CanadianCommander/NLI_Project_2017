for me is important to say that most of the persons start from the same level .i mean same money and culture .so when somebody is joung he have to decide what to do in his life , so he has to decide .the problem is that almost anybody know what he will do in his future .that s the reason becouse a lot of people do a lot of different jobs at the beginning hopying to find the right one .the purpose of the man is to find the best way to live , at least for himself .when he finally find the job that he think is good enough for his aims , he will not do anithyng else , he will not find another job to replace it , maybe he will try to improve his job or find a secondary job .that s why this situation gives him stability and he will feel safety .that s could be the reason becouse even successful people try new things rather than ordinary people .in fact is very difficult that some business man risks to improve his , already good , situation .but even the ordinary people think the same : they wo nt risk to lose what they have , even if could be just a bit for a big business man .i thing that somebody will not risk anymore when he find the harmony between his requests and his possibilities .besides very often even if somedody do nt know how to do well one thing , the important is that it s linked with his aims .
