i fully disagree with this sentence .some people say that it is more useful to have bread knowledge of many academic than to on specific subject .they argue that by two reason ; these days , much informations are more valuable than any other things and it is more useful if you find job .i , however , have convincing evidence to the contrary .first , some people argue that much informations are most valuable .however they do not see why their argument is far-fetched .actually , information is very important to anybody .also many medias provide various information ; like internet , tv news , and so on .so we can get a much information by medias .but they do not provide always true .if you get wrong informatin , you could get disadvantage .so many companys and people effort to find currect information .therefore their argument which much informations are most valuable , does not stand to reason .second , some people claim that if you find a job , broad knowledge is more helpful .however this is not always true .actually , thease days , many company reguire knowledge of specific subject when they employ person .if you have knowledge of specific subject , you will easier find a job .actually , many companis emphasis that when they introduce their company in university or other places .hence , their claim , which is broad knowledge is more helpful , has no persuasion .therefore , with unswerving conviction , i firmly disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic .all in all , i strongly believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject .it is more helpful anybody .
