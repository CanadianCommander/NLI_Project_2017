after pondering this question thoroughly and prudently , i finally reach the point that it depends .if a student wants to go directly into the workforce after graduation , it s may better for him to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .on the other hand , if another student wants to become a specialist in a given domain , i think he d better specialize in that one specific subject .nowadays the number of college students who hunt for a job just after graduation keeps increasing .mainly because they are aware of that different job require different knowledge or skills .some jobs require a student can use a computer fluently and skillful , some may hope a student to be capable to speak different kind of lauguages , and some others may just use those whose have the intensive ability of coorporation and sccialization .to mee to various requirement of jobs , students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .take my sister for example .before graduation , she did nt know what job exactly she wanted to pursue .but since she had broad knowledge gained from many subjects in college .she sent innumerable applications to very diverse companys .guess what ?all of those companys said ok to her .and then she could choose the best one from them .but if a student , like me , dreams of becoming a specialist or even a scientist in a certain realm , he should and must specialize in that one specific subject .the foremost reason why i said that is , only this way , can a student make great consentrate on that one subject and learn more about it .like me , i always think i will becom a specialist in ee , so , now i put all of my focus and energy on that subject .by doing more research and reading more refference book of that subject , i obtained a profound understanding about it .although i ca nt assert that i am a master today in ee , i have took the most significant step to be a master i think .taking into account of all that mentioned above , i draw the conclution that this question depends .
