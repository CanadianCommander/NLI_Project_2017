i will disagree that there will be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years .i can give the following reasons for my opinion .firstly , the population of the world is increasing exponentially .this will increse the the need of transport .when viewed in detail about majority of the countries , the chief means of transport is car .as per to satisfy the needs of growing population the usage cars will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statementthe second reason is the declination in cost of car .when studied about the statatics from the time of invention of car .the cost of cars is declined to a larger extent .this made cars available to the large middle class societies in the world .since the economic and financial status of the people are incresing the middle class societies also incresing .this mens the need of car is also incresing .this combines the declining prices of car and the usage of car will be incresed .this means that in the near future the usage of car will be further incresed .nowadays cars are manufactured which runs on battery .so , eventhough shortage of the petroleum resources will never reduce the usage of the cars .car has become the comfortable transport . .the comfortability will increase with the advancements in the technology furthermore , which makes people to use cars as their chief means of transport .also cars are safier to travel when compared to bikes and cycles .in view of the above reasons i believe that the usage of car will never decrease in the next twenty years .
