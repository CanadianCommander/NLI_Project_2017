is not easy in this case to completely agree or disagree with this statement .reason being that ideas and concept can not prescind from understanding of facts .a fact is something that is happened , while a concept is the reason why it happened .these two things have to go together for an individual to be able to catch the complete essence of things .for me , what this statement says , is that what happened in the past can easily be ignored , that facts , what truly happened before , play little or no importance in a student s learning experience .every history teacher will scream when hearing such an opinion .in many cases , facts can teach a lot more than concepts .just think about our whole story , the story of mankind , and the big crime we would commit when ignoring what man did before us .you can study about culture and philosophy , about religion and mathematics , but you will never completely understand about yourself and the others until you ve learned about what has already happened and what has already been done .the concept of genocyde can be explained with hundreds of words , but will never be fully understood until what happened has been studied and observed through documents and videos .so the concept of , to give a contrasting example , driving a car can be explained with loads of words and ideas .but only when it comes to actually show what happens if you take a certain action you can fully understand about driving .at the other side , i must say that without a complete understanding of basic concepts , it is impossible to study proficiently any subject .whatewer will be shown to you , always needed will be a clear concept that explains the meaning of what you see .a major difference between an italian university and an american one is in the different learning method : while in the italian institution fundamental is the necessity of remembering word by word what is explained in the books , without any practical application , in the american method this study is accompanied by an active class discussion and group participation .the first method will obviously bring every student to memorize the concepts studied , but sometimes without even understanding them , while with application and confrontation in the class , basic understanding of the concepts is needed to constructively participate and learn .without concepts , there is no understanding of facts ; without facts there is no `` real  understanding of concepts .the two things must go together .
