i do not agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjectwhile having a knowledge of many disciplines may increase a person s know how a great deal , it does not make him an expert in any of these fields .one might spend so much time learning and yet be able to acquire limited information in each of the subjects that he studied .for example , if i study zoology during my graduation , and then go for a double major in international business and geology .i would know a little about each subject but not enough for me to become an expert .i would be confused in selecting a subject for further study as i would wonder if i know more about international business or about geology .the proverb `` jack of all trades but master of none  summarises this situation very aptly .on the other hand devoting all of one s time to studying one subject will give a person enough knowledge to make him an expert .one will thus understand the subject better and be in a better position to apply his knowledge practically .giving a similar example , if i choose zoology during both my graduation and post graduation , i will have learnt more about the subject as well its various branches like fisheries and ethology that may not be not covered in the graduate course .after knowing so much i can do a phd in the same field and that might give me a chance in the future to become a subject expert in the form of either a research scholar or lecturer whose opinion is held highly and who knows a great deal about his subject .therefore , i prefer studying one discipline in order for me to have more knowledge and insight into my subect of choice , better opportunities for further study such as phd and eventually better career options .after all , an institution would prefer an expert to be a part of their team rather than someone who knew a little bit .
