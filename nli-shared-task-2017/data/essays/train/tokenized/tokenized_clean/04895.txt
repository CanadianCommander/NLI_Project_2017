i think less and less young people nowadays take time to help their communities is true , but i do nt think the reason is because they do nt have enough time to help the communities .if you take times to go to some campuses to take a look at , you will figure out what do our yang generation do after classes .more and more coffee shops , restaurants were opened , yang people drink and eat whole the day , from sunday to monday , from day to night .it seems they rather than take time doing nothing , but not willing to do something for those people they might need to help .i do nt know what s wrong with our education system , however , it s really bad because most of our yang generation are so unconsiderable for everything .
