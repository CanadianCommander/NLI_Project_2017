according to my experience from the college years , i can say that learning facts is necessary to be successful in your undergraduate education since facts are used in every part of the lectures .also learning facts are of great value to understand the life and to make easier it for yourself .because the world and the environment that you live in is full of facts everywhere .for example , you wake up every morning , see the sun and then night comes and this goes on in this way .so you can not understand the difference between morning and the evening unless you know the facts about the rotation of earth around the sun .hence facts help us to examine the world and have a meaningful life .but i think that facts are not sufficient to understand everything .learning ideas and concepts is more important for students .because learning a concept means learning everything and understanding every term about it .in the same way , learning an idea consists of learning every concept , every thought and every fact behind it .so you can learn the facts while you are trying to get the meaning of an idea or a concept .also facts are hard to be memorized .when you get the idea once , you do not forget it and you remember the fact by this way also .furthermore , having studied ideas and concepts will give us a way of thinking about people and their behaviors .for example , when you are thinking on an idea or when you are analyzing an idea you may think about the people who had this idea before .questions such as `` why these people had proposed this idea such years ago ?  or `` what kind of differences are there between us ? `` may come to mind .thus , these kind of questions help you to understand the behaviours of the people and may be useful to find out new things related to yourself .as a conclusion , learning ideas and concepts are more valuable to students than learning facts .
