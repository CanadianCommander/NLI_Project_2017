some people are of the opinion that the best way to travel is to take a trip by alone .such people tend to think that they feel more comfortable taking a travel alone as they do not have to follow the schedules and intentions of others .in my opinion , however , the best way to travel is in a group by tour guide .this essay will discuss the two key reasons to support my opinion in more detail below .first , i am definitely of the opinion that it is best to take a trip in a group led by a tour guide .the reason is that i can get a sense of security when traveling in a group .for example , if i lose all of my money on the way to my travel by accident , i can ask somebody participating in the tour as well as the tour guide for help at any time .that is to say , in case of emergency , i do not have to worry about financial problems during my trip .hence , i do believe it is much better and safer to take a trip in a gruop guided by a tour conductor .second , i do feel that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is more affordable to take part in package tours as a group .not only that , i can get more useful information about the places and sites which i am going to visit from the tour guide in more effecive ways .on the other hand , it is really tiresome and troublesome for me to make my study plans such as the duration of my travel , where to stay , and making a list of places to viist on my own .to conclude , all things stated above considered , i do feel the best way to take a trip is in a group led by a tour guide as it is more secure , financially affordable and more easy to get the more useful and enjoyable information regarding my trip .
