i gisagree with this statement .it is true that some young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , but there are also some young people who do it .for example , my friend went to elderly peoples dorm to do volunteer work .she talked a lot with the eldery peoples .she said to me  elderly people looked happy when i talked with them .oher student just went there as intership , but i think we did volunteer work .we could make them happy .when i heard that , i felt that young people nowadays not all bad person .the are many young people who are kind and do volunteer works .another example , i had cleaned my city to do volunteer work to take up raddishes on the road when i was a elememtaly school student and a junior high school student .other students in our city also did such a volunteer work .moreover , it does nt mean  give enough time to helping their communities  but i want to say this .nowadays , i often see that young people give thier seats to the elderly people .i also often give my seat to elderly people .does nt it mean we help our community ?i also think that working very hard , taking great degree at school , keeping the best score by school activity sports and writing great arts also means that we help our community .for instance , great school which made grate students will be known other cities and thev city will be famous .there are many students who study hard or plactice sport to win the play .above all , i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their communities .
