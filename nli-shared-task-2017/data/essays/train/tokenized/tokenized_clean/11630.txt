i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .the twenty first century is accompanied with a lot of growth and development in science .globalisation has led to a lot of countries coming to our country and trading here .this is generally seen to leave an impact on people .the cultural values are slowly fading away from our society .young people are given the responsibility to help their community move ahead and have a strong stand in the society .unfortunately , the younger generation has failed to divide their time and use it to the fullest .the cultures are changing at a very high pace .it is seen that the young people want to take an easier path and go with the flashy stuff .little do they realise that by doing this they will eventually let their community to fade away in the longer span of life .they are so impressed by other lifestyles and communities that they forget their responsibility .people are migrating to different countries .most of the countries have formed a group of a certain community people .but , it is seen that there are very few who work whole-heartedly for their communities .others , usually either do nt have time or are reluctant to help .it is also seen that the younger generation lack the sense of responsibility .they have taken it rather too lightly .they will have time to go to a party with friends or go to a holiday with the family but find it too difficult to take out time for community development .helping out their community is rather a kind of formality for them .they might pay the yearly allowances but never care to go and check if its actually being used to the fullest .even if they make it a point to attend to it at certain intervals and make some improvement , it would make a lot of improvement .what is required is their full support and their ideas to help it flourish .they should realise that it is a kind of an investment .this will never go waste .the more they will help , the more the next generation is going to benefit from it .this should give it importance because if not looked upon now , the values will become extinct sometime .no-one will care for their origin .it will come as a setback later .the hardwork of our ancestors should not go waste .
