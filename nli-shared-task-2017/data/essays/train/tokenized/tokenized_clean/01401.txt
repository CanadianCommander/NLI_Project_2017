`` the world is a stage , and we are all players .as shaekespear told , we are the players on this huge stage , who try to enjoy in their short life span .in this case young people are more lucky than older people because they have more life enrgy , and they did not see the bad side of life yet .my first reason is that the vivid energy of young people is higher than older people , for they have less responsibility .the older people have to sustain their life themselves , and sometimes they have to look after the youngs .for example , older people have to work and gain money in order to get their basic life needs such as eating or housing .however , the young people do not have to gain money .they can get from their parents what they need .so , young people can use their all energy to enjoy the life , and they are more happy than older .furthermore , the young people do not have more experience than the older people , including the bad ones .the older people made mistakes in their past , and are afraid to do those mistakes again in their future .while they are preventing themselves from bad events , they miss the enjoyable things on world .on the other hand , the young people , who have less experience can move further steps in the enjoyful life , for they are not afraid doing the wrong thing .they even do not know what is wrong .while old people are being stuck in their bad experiences , younger people live in the sunny side of the world .to sum up , being a young person i can say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do , because we are loaded with more energy to use for being happy , and we did not see yet the realities which makes people unhappy .
