i think i would agree with the statement that it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having vast knowledge in several kind of subjects allows you to have an opinion on such or such topic whereas if you specialize in only one area of study , you can not form a rich opinion on any other area of study but your own .if you take the french academic system versus the american one .it clearly shows this difference .in france , when you enter university you have to choose a section , for example if i want to major in english , i wo nt be able to add psychology as a minor .so you have to specialize yourself quite early .although this system tends to change , little by little , now with the ects system , which basically premits french students to go and study through europe with the transfer of their credits and vice versa . .whereas in the united states , each class is assigned to a specific number of credits , during your first two years of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of classes as long as you get a enough credits to validate your academic year .this means that you can take an anthropology as well as an algebra class .thanks to this system , it enables you to get to know various subjects and to be able , later on , to choose in what realm of study you want to pursue your studies .in my opinion , this system is part of the reason why so many international students want to come and study in america .they want to see what each subject has to offer before specializing in one in particular .
