young people enjoy life more than older people dofrom my point of view , i belive the young and old people enjoy they life the same .there is time for everything and a moment .to understand peoples behaiviors , we need to see , where are they come from , what are they like to do , social and personal interest .for example ; i born in costa rica , small country where young and old people enjoy soccer , and dancing , and are no different from others people or cultures around the world .younger people is more active and careless , they no have many responsabilities , so they use all they free or spare time , doing many things , such as : a ) - sports , b ) - travel , c ) - dating , d ) - working part time , e ) - study. , hoping that something really works out for them and have some fun at the time .many like my self , take some adventure and leave the country , try to find new horizonts and adventures .older people the still have fun , and they enjoy they life in they way , becuse usully older peolpe have more responsabilities , such a family , childs , full time works or carries , they have less time to do what they really like , but that doesnt meant that they no enjoy they life .the meaning of enjoy life is in everyone , we all enjoy our life in so many differents ways , and as long we belive that is correct , is ok .be young or old is depent in each person , some people young are like old people , and some old people are like young people .enjoy life is a present from god , and we need to be gracefull just for be alive and see as much as we can of this work .enjoy life is no matter to be young or old , enjoy life is live life .
