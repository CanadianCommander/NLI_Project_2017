`` why do nt you get more involved in church community activities ?, my father used to ask me when i was younger .in my oppinion there are a lot of factors that have to be taken in account , when analyzing the modern situation .but the trend certainly shows , that young people spend less time for helping their community .modern improvements forced us to focus more on individuality than years before .for instance , many television advertisments show successful stars , who want to show the importance of individual potential .if you are a great actor or singer , why focusing on the community ?this will sooner or later evolve to an attitude of egoistic .which means , i am the most important person in my life and this is what really matters .second , young people are less bound to their evironment and requirements for a successful life changed .today , you need to be able to adjust in a short time , for instance , to a new city or country .otherwise , employers might choose someone else for the job .furthermore , expactations of adults towards children changed , too .school and marks are more important than anything .as a matter of fact , students in japan spend most of the time in school or at home , while preparing classes and learning from textbooks .there is hardly any time left for the community .yet , the most striking factor is human lazyness .for example , when you live in a big city , you do nt rely on your neighbours .however , many people living in huge , crowded areas do not even know the people living next to them .there is no reason for communication and as long there is a possibility , that people take advantage of your friendship without giving something in return , human nature tends to refuse interaction .supermarkets , cold stores and several other services enabled people to live independent from any community .there is obviously no need for a community .in conclusion , i agree with the statement .roughly speaking , young people avoid responsibility towards communities in recent decades .certainly , they should think about changing their minds in the future and realize the benefits .
