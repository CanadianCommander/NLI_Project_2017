to a certain extent i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in order to equip oneself with the basic information on life , science and people , the knowledge about all the areas is mandatory .i also belive that after gaining breadth of all the subjects , one should persue some area of her interest in order to gain specialization .it is highly important to have broad knowledge of many subjects as most of the subjects are inter-related .the knowledge about one subject is needed to understand the other subject .for example : science , in order to understand the concepts of science the basic knowledge of mathametics is mandatory and this knowledge of mathematics gives a better perspective and vision of science .also , knowledge about many subjects helps to understand other areas of education .a student specializing in mathematics would remain unaware of his histotrical background or would remain unaware about the laws of nature if the basic education of history and science is not imparted to him .the broad knowledge of many academic subjects also gives an individual an opportunity to identify her area of interest .lack of knowledge on a subject would never expose a potential student to that subject and he would remain unaware .when the broad knowledge of many subjects are important , it is also important to specialize in one area of interest to sustain in today s competitive world .in today s era , people are highly competitive and just the basic broad knowledge of subjects would not earn a respected living .it is required to specialize in one area and at the same time having the breadth of information about other subjects .
