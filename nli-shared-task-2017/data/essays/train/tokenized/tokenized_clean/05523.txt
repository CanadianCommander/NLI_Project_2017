in my opinion , i do not agree with the assertion becasue there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities .with the advent of internet or other media , people have become easiler to get information that their community need them to help .for example , in my apartment , the memebers of commitee announces the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up certain event .and they often receive a lot of responses that say they would like to help .comparing to the past , there are few people informed that they are needed to help something .thus , i contrarily think more and more yound peole involve in community activies becasue they are more familier with the internet than the people before , and understand they are in demand .in addition , in my shcool , university always encourage students to do something that can benefit our community or society .for example , they are encouraged to clean the streets and help teach older people who are illiterate to read .university do not pay the student that do service for community .nevertheless , many students often come to sign up for doing this kind of service .perhaps they will receive award , such as a certificate or a mendal instead of money .but after all , they do involve in and understandour society and community .when you broaden the scale to our society , you can also see that there are more and more institutions which encourage young peple to help disable people .for example , in my country , we have `` sun shine  gas stations , which only hire disable people and young peole who are willing to help those disability .inconclusion , i think that we have more chances for young people to hlep our communities becasue there are more ways they can choose to serve their own communities .this can be seen whether at shcool or our society or even in an apartment comunity .
