people may not deny that famous artist and actors are educated and trained by special programs even since their childhood .even though they do not have broad knowledge , they can be successful people because they are an expert in their special field .walking dictionaries can not survive anymore in this dog-eat-dog society .when i heard the story of my aunt , i was amazed .my aunt who really likes dancing was a trouble maker in the school when she was a teenager .she only thinks about dance , but not school working .she was failing in almost every subjects .her parents and teachers were very worried about her .she could not even adapt to school life because everybody thought she is very stupid .nevertheless she did not care what others think .she just keep practicing dancing and singing .nobody never thinks that she would become such a popular person .10 years later , everybody was surprised and amazed at her .the reason everybody was surprised , she became a actress who is acting on musical stages .everybody wants to see her acting .her dancing and singing make people fascinating and happy .her picture and interviews were on newspapers , magazines and tv shows .now nobody thinks that she is `` stupid .people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are obviously very smart but they might not know what is he or she really interested in .however , people who love speicific subject know what they are intersted in and why they are studying that subject , thus , they can learn more and deeper .
