i would say , that society definitly need to have a broden academic knowledge as much as possible in different subjects .let s take an architect as an example , to make my point .an architect should know a little bit of literatur , arts and biology , in order to create a better housing schema .because , he does not build for himself , or for other architects , he builts for people with totally different interest , and living ways .in the other hand , i think that people should also specialize in only one topic , but only after they get a global view of the world s chances and opportunities .what i think what the best method could be , is when you get an overview of the possibilities of the academic ( and no academic ) subjects , and after that , you can decide what fits you better , so in the future , you can not only improve your skills to the maximum , but as well be happy .in the spezialsation you get deeper knowledge , so your skills will potentially grow .let s get back to the example of the architect , he ca nt definitly make the whole buildin by his own , so after he search for the qualities of the surroundings , research about the urban spatial situation , and get a good solution to plan , he would need , architects that are specialized in sort of things , like construction , fassade , context , enviorement , etc. architects , which profundize , in those programs .but they could never work toghether , when they did nt have an overview of the situation .in my opinion , a doctor , or a music teacher , that does nt know something about geography , or bussiness admistration , is not able to respond to our actual world , which is a global world , where you have to act promptly with grat ideas to big problems an conflict , that are everywhere .finally , if a persone just get inside a box without looking forward in order to broaden his horizons , is a person that does nt have dreams .
