numbers versus ideaswhen students are considered to be mechanical masses that absorb and memorize words and numbers without processing them using their own intellect , one can easily believe that learning facts is the only virtue that students should need .however , this is too far from being the logical and humane approach to the matter .it is the ideas behind the facts that make the students evolve and turn into bright minded individuals that will undoubtedly lead their societies towards a better future .to compherend , for example , the mechanism that makes an aeroplane take off is far more important for a student than to memorize the maximum speed of that particular type of aeroplane .it is comprehension that triggers imagination .understanding ideas provides the learners with the opportunity to have an unchained mind which is absolutely the prime element of both individual and collective improvement .think of an individiual who has only been practicing in his studies the commonly adopted techniques based on the facts that are already available , without bravely experimenting new ideas .how far could he go ?not too far , that is for sure .if it had nt been for those who have bright ideas labed as ` crazy` , our world would nt have been as colorful as it is now .as a conclusion , one should always keep in mind that we owe what we have today to those bright ideas of yesterday .
