first of all i agree only partially with the statement above , and in particulary i think it ca nt be considered an always valid statment .i think that the problem is very simple : the statement can be considered true if we want to do a generical analysation of the problem .it s well known that advertisements are done to try to sell a certain product , and so if they are not convincing how can the productor sell them ?a second factor is that in the world we live now , we are completely submersed by products of every type , every form , every colour and every brand , how could we choose one of them without advertisements or explanations of what the product is consisting on ?i have also to admit that sometimes the companies of medias exagerate in telling lies , but is in the intelligence of the person who have to buy something to not believe in everything they say , and first of all see the product with their eyes , ask for informations about it , compare the price and the features with that of the other products of the other companies , and finally buy the object .generally i apply the way of thinking i explained above , but i have to admit that sometimes they captured me in their advertisement ; i will give you an example : some months ago i had to go to london to improve my english language , and when i had to book the flight i checked on internet the different possibilities .flight sometimes are very expensive , expecially for a young girl like me and so i remembered i had seen an advertisement on a train in my city of a very low price company of flights .then i found it on internet and booked my flight at a very surprising price !only 50 euros !first i was very happy , but when i arrived at the aireport i had to paid 50 euros more for my luggages and 30 euros more for the overweight of my luggages !!!i was very very very angry and i decided i wo nt believe anymore in the future in people who promit you something without asking anything !!
