there will be less cars than nowadays , in twenty years time ?my answer to this quetion is no .as the technology improves , there must be other transport that can replace the car , which is the most importatnt transport to people these days .people might invent something much safer , faster and more comfortable .however , i think it is just going to be an improvement .what i mean by improvement is that they change the shape , fuel that car uses or even electronical and technological things that car requires .for example , automatic car .automatic car is controlled by the computer system in the car so that driver do not have to drive him or herself .if they wishes to drive then they can change it back to mannual mode .also , fuel that cars needed migth be change in twenty years time .these days most of people use gas or patrol .but in the future we might use solar energy or electrcity instead of gas or patrol as its fuel .there are some cars already use electricity but it needs more improvement to make it perfect .futhermore , car might be able to travel above the water or under the water , not just on the road .i ve seen a bus once in liverpool that it can travel on the road and above the sea .it can be easily changable so that people can travel with their car above the water as well as on the road .to sum up , there are so many improvements can be made without inventing something new .beside , i think it is better to improve cars than inventing somethin new as we are used to it .
