i do nt agree because first its under conditions law , second to able to make an effective advertisement needs money .and that means if you are successfull you have money and you can make advertisement .third if an advertisement is lying that will increase sales for short term .in long run consumer will chose the trustable producer .so the advertisement cannot be in sight in long run .first the advertisements are under control of law .it has very big punnishments to lie costumers .everyone had paid attention to to the speaches at the end of advertisements like `` batteries not included  or `` each sold seperately  .of corse that s not the biggest example to the laws about consumer protection .but they haveto tell people even if it s just battery .my second arguement is money .if you want to make good advertisement you will need a lot of money .in turkey there was a tv mafia serial named `` kurtlar vadisi  .at the final of the serial sharon stone and andy garcia was acted as the worlds mafia leaders .and the producer paid 500 000 $ each of them .that means 1 million dolars for one and half hours tv serial .producers efford this crazy amount of money from advertisements .and the firms make the advertisement are really big and successfull companies .to became successfull you have to be honest to your customers .third if producers lie costumers it make the sales better at the test time .after then the sales will reduce .and every one will remember the company as a lier .do you pay attention how many advertisement we saw in a short time and we never heard this companies again .this is like natural selection .if you are good you can live as the examples companies can not cheat the costumers by advertisement .exactly no one expect wings from red bull its a little bit commedy .everyone can understand that i think
