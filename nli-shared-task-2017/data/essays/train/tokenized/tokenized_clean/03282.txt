i agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .in the following paragraphs i will try to defend my stand using various reasons and arguments .any learning process is useful only when it has some real world applications and makes a significant contribution to the life and personality of the learner .just take an example of any engineering or science subject .you know that an induction motor produces electricity in such and such way , and that this type of combustion may give this result .but what is the use of these facts learned ?the learning is complete only when you see that motor installed anywhere and doing something that is very useful for the individual or community , like drawing water from a deep bore and when you go to any smelting unit and see the same combustion process being used to process metals and make alloys .so , we can say that to understand concepts and ideas is actually application based learning whereas learning facts is just theoratical learning .unless theoratical learning is complemented with application based learning , the entire learning process remains incomplete for an individual .this does not apply only to science and technology subjects .consider a student of dramatics , studying a subject , say `` shakspear s plays  .he can very well learn the entire plot and scenes , story of any play , but how will that do any good to him ?only when he is able to understand the messages and implications , like what is the emotional aspect of the play , why is a particular character behaving in a particular manner , what were the circumstances in writer s life under which he wrote the play , that his learning can be said to be complete .so we can safely conclude that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
