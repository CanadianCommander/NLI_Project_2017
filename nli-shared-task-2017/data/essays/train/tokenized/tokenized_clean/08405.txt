the trend of our society is to become older and older due to the fact that the number of birth is strongly decreasing years by years .in this kind of society , according to recent statistics , old people try to continue to behave as they did when they were young some years ago , while young people tend to wait more rather than to be active .notwithstanding the results of this statistics , i strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .they have the opportunity to get in connections with more people as well to have strong motivation to do new things .first , young people have the chance to have good physical mobility .this allows them to profit of sport activities that can give many satisfactions .as an example , they can profit of scuba - diving and see the beauties of the sea or they can have a wide view from the sky when they perform some parachute activities .in addition , thanks to their mobility , they can reach different and new places and enrich their culture of precious , brilliant and peculiar images of world s gems .second , young people have more satisfactions from doing things as they have probably experienced some situations only few times in their life .as in all new activities , they have an adrenalinic peak in their body that makes them feeling happy .that creates a virtous schema : the statisfaction implies also a strong motivation to do new things and viceversa .therefore we know , from a recent survey done in italy , that more than the 50 % of young people under 35 years are eager to do at least one new activities or a travel in a not visited country per year .in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they are eager to do new experiences and have the physical mobility to do that .becoming older , they become more experienced but lost the motivation and the commitment to exploit life .
