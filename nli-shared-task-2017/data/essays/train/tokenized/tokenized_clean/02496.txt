some people believe that , in about twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in my point of view , i do not agree with such assertion , and i have two major rearons for my view .firstly , i am aware of the fact that people love cars .from the time the humans were able to build airplanes and automobiles , these dreams and the realization became the pride of the century .the history of the automobils stands for a turning point for the modern world .poeple design cars , and they cherish what they have done to open the market and world for automobiles .successful examples such as the volkswagen and the bmw have been the symbols of the glamour of this industry .therefore , in such a period of time of twenty years , cars will still hold the love for millions around the world .the numbers of prodction will only be steady , if only not to increase .secondly , we need the automobile industry to provide job opportunities .as a result , as we need this industry to grow at a steady pace , we need automobiles in our lives .imagine thousands of commuters boarding onto the public transportaiton in a single week .it would not only be a huge burden for the the transportaiton system , but also affects many aspects of our lives .overall , in the next twenty years , i do not think that there will be fewer cars .we need cars regardless what the world will become .
