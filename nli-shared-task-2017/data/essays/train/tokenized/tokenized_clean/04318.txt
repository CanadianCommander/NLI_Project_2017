recently , a hot issue about whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is wildly discussed among the students and professor .somepeople hold that one can learn more about the world by having broad knowledge .and other s agrue that having a expertise in a specific subject can led a bright way for people in their career life .as to me , i prefer to the former one that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .since we live in a complex and extensive world , having broad knowledge contributes to helping us to know more about the world we live in .with the knowledge of many academic subjecs , one can easily explain some case that happens everyday around us .for example , one of my friends always leads the origniation by observing the poision of stars when we hike outside .besides , have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can also help us to better understand the knowledge in a single subject .becaues the knowledge is interweaved to some extent , the knowledge gained in one lessen can be applied to solve a difficult problems in an other fields .for instance , i offen find that princples teached in management class can be a good guide when i plan to set a project that required by marketing lesson .at last , i think the student should not only to have broad knowledge but also to specialize in one specific subject as well in order to meet the demand of society /
