i totally disagree the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i disagree this because i am a young people who pay enough time to helping my communty .why am i so sure that young people give enough time to helping their communites ?first , i would like to say that in my university , there are numerous clubs of devoting .i am the one of these clubs member .we go to some retirement associations to chat with old people .some of them have children , but their children are too busy to go to meet them .so we go there to acompany with them and to clean the enviroment .sometimes we go to meet childern who lost their parents .most of them are still very young , but do have enough love from family .so we become their brothers or sisters .we go there for teaching and giving them love .moreover , every students in my university must help for the community .this is the course we must take , if we do not serving , we will not graduate .although some students are relunctant to do this , but after they help the community , all of them are happy and willing to do the service by volunteer .finally , i do not disagree that some people say we do not give enough time to helping .because all of the member in my clubs like to do this service .actually , we do not think that we are helping people , we think that we learn a lot from them .all of my friends like to do this , and we think we are not giving .in fact , they are really give us a lot when we helping .
