world is progressing towards pinnacles of technology and science everyday .people have become more conscious about living standards .earlier idea was to save maximum money for generations and thus , people spent less in luxury .nowadays , buying a car is much easier than saving money as government keep track of all your black money .can you think of depositing black money in bank ?do nt you plan to change your car with changing fashion ?do you really care for saving for future ?today , people think for comfort and not money .so , who can think of reduction in number of four wheelers ?i believe that car is not a status symbol but has become necessity .can you think of going to write your exam by bus ?oh !it is really pathetic .i would prefer a car as it will keep my mind relaxed and air conitioned environment reduces fear and anxiety .i disagree with the statement , `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .although , industrialization and increasing number of vehicles on roads has led to major problem of pollution , but this does nt mean that people will stop buying cars .we always have alternative solutions to a problem .now you will say that fuel is on the verge of exhaustion .but , with increasing technical and scientific advances we can come out of the problem of lowering volumes of petrol and diseal .you must have heard of `` biodiseal  been used successfully in brazil .there are so many alternative fuels available these days .thanks to science !what about gasoline ?it is widely used as an alternative fuel .in india , new delhi has shown dramatic results by using `` compressed gas  ( popularly known as cng ) .it is known as clean fuel thus saving environment from pollution .so , now what you say ?do we really have to stop buying cars ?after twenty years , will there be any change in number of cars ?in my opinion , yes there will be change but a positive increase in number because now people are more educated .they care for environment and thus fuel these days is used judiciously .scientists all over the world are experimenting in order to find oil from bacteria and plants .`` jatropha  , a drought resistant plant has been a boon for dry countries as these plants can be grown in harsh climate areas also .they are found to release oil which can be collected by harvesting the seeds of this plant and then sent to industries for purification processes .so , there is no need to reduce the number of cars as so many clean fuels are available .they are less toxic than fossil fuels .technical advances are on the way to create a pollution free environment and gives hope for new horizons leading to more luxurios cars in the future .
