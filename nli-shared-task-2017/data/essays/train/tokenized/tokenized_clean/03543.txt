i agree with that statment , and in the following lines i will support my idea .when we watch an advertisment about a product , in most of the cases we asume that the product is better than it probably is .in effect , we think that the product has a good cualities because we asume that the producers make a lot of exams to probe his product , but when we buy the product , and we follow the advetisments , we sometimes we can notice that the product has not the sufficient advertisment that it supposed to be .for example , if you buy a pesticide , and in the advertisments say that you can use in home , and you used in the plants of your home , in a few days your plants probably die .the reason of thism is because the advertisments did not tell you that you can not use the pesticide in the plants of your home .as we can see , because the advertisments we assumed that the pesticide was a good product , much better than really is .in conclution , i agree with the statement , because in many times , the the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , and when we used , we noticed that the products are not good .
