i agree that most advertisements make products seems to be much more better than they really are concerning the material used and satisfaction to consumers .useing a below average materials in some products and advertise it the best .for example , a hire dryer that will be bought and in the next day it is burned .the seacond reason is consumer satisfaction .seeing an advertisment about a very comfortable and wonderfull car for example and when rideing it it s completlly the opposite .in conclusion , not all advertisements are true .it s all about selling there products in other words it s about mony .consumers are the last in there tasks .
