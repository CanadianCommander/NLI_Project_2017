i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do becasue the following reason .to enjoy life , first thing we have to realize is how precious our lives are .the life does not have to be a special one such as celebrities s or politician s .the normal life itself is already special enough .without appriciate our lives we never really enjoy neither youth or life .however there are many young people who seem to loose their interest in thier lives .even though they are many things from they can take advantages , such as education for all children , development of computer systems , easy access to all around the world , avalability of social supports and so on , they do not seem to be happy .they rather seem to take all advatages for granted or do not realize how lucky they are .one of the reasons why young people lost their will to live thier life more actively is that they are not able to picturelize how they would be in ten years later .becasue of bad economy , political mess , untrustable politicians , strange teachers etc. it is not easy to keep their dreams and ambitions for children .instead they learn the word `` that s life  or `` that s the way it is  with a feeling of giving up .so , those chirdlen grow up and become young adult who has no vision for the future .on the other hands , even though older people is loosing their physical abilities they still have will to live .especially old people who have war-experience know how to appriciate what we have .life becomes enjoyable as long as people appriciate it .if life is simply to consume time , it could be awful time for waitng the ending .
