in todays maket of fittest to survive it is just like a ` rams fight  .the two rams , the competitors , have to collide very carefully .one wrong move may result in the death of the other .yes you guessed it right .understanding the ideas more than the facts or vice versa can give an edge to the other competitor or probably lack of satisfaction .in an age of managers , who are generalists , who need specialists .why would a company for example hire an employee with a specific knowldge of sales when he can get a person with a knowldge of all sectors viz a viz sales , marketing , finance etc. for the same job , for the same money .now a days every place we go or any person we meet tend impress us only if it is closer to perfect .as i said earlier i small error , destroys the emperor .leave about how the worlds takes you , think about your personal self .would it not feel unsatisfied with what you have if you can or should have had when wanted .its a little complex .let us take it this ways , you have to go through the annual report of your company .your colleague also gets it and at the presentation he outshines you in just knowing the facts by heart or take it the other ways round .would you not feel sorry for yourself for not learning the facts or probably not understanding the ideas and concepts of the report when you could have done that .yes absolutely .so here we are .now we can really conclude that having the basic ideas and concepts are as much importance as knowing the facts and facets .afterall its not just about completing the task it about compleating it perfectly
