there are several views which is related to this topic .some may think that there is no helping from young people for their communities .however , i disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays , there are a lot of social problems in the world .these problems have to solve by citizens .however , if it ca nt solve at the first generation , the new generation , young people is needed .therefore , we can easily observed from the cases that most of university student is participating for their society .they sometimes resist about unfair politics or not good enough international plans .for these case , we can realize that how they are really interested in thier society and try to help thier communities .furthermore , all societies are educating young people .this education makes student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up .so we can not determine that they are not helping their communities .because studying is the basic resource which makes educated people to think about social problems and to find the way to solve some problems .for a real , educated people usually participate their sociey .finally , the school has a resposible for educating people without any limitations except ages .they educate not only academic resources but also the importance about helpful behaves to poor people .we can easily notice from activities in school like go to orphanage and help orphans .of course , it is involved in the scores and most school requires the record of working for poor people .young people are educated efficiently for help their communities .when they educated , they naturally have an attitudes to think about social problems as well as the student who did not study hard .also young people is the main resources which will manage and control the world .thus , it is not appropriate argument that young people is not helping thier communities .
