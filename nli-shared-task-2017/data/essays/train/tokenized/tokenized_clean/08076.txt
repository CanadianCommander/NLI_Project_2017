recently , the products of advertisements have developed , so most advertisers advertise products much better than actual .is it really good for customers ?i disagree with the statement for these reasons .first of all , when customers try to buy something , the advertisements are also one of the points that they chose which to buy .if the advertisement is too much better than actual products , customers will disappoint .second , it takes much money to advertise .in order to attract a lot of customers , producers make advertisement wonderful , so when this situation happen , the cost of advertisement becomes much more expensive .if producers spend money to advertise more than to make products , they can not made real good things .in addition , products may become poor .also , it is bad not only customers but also producers to make poor products .it means that customers do nt want to buy poor things although the advertisement is really nice , so products ca nt be bought .in conclusion , it is important to attract customers by advertisement , but it is not good to spend too much money to advertise .so , i think that the producer should make products better and spend money to improve products and invent new things rather than great advertisement .therefore , i do nt prefer to make products seem much better than they really are by advertisement .
