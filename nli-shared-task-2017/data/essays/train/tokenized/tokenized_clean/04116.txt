i think it is more important for us student to learn facts than to understand the idea .for my personal experience , i learned more when i learned the facts first .i had been raised in taiwan .when i was a student in elementary school , middle school , and high school in my country , teachers taught us or asked us to memorize two times one equals two , two times two equals four , two times three equals six , and so on .at that time , no one told me why , i had been wondered why two times one equals two , but i had no choice and be forced to memorize them .as time went by , i have been taken many math classes , such as algerbla 1 , algerbla 2 , calculous , so and so .i realized why two times one equals two which bothered me when i was a 8 years old kid .i first memorize the `` facts  , and understand the `` idea  itself .although now you may think there s a time consume , and start wondering how long does it take me to realize the reason why two times one equals two .honestly , it did nt take me too much time to understand the concept , and the most important thing is i got the idea by myself which is more valuable .i feel more confident and start been an indepent thinker .moreover , i wo nt forget about it because people always learn by the experience .
