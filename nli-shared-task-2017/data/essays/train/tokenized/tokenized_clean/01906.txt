twenty years later ?it is considered as in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there were today .this statement may become true or false , because it is a guess but why people believed in that guess or not .first of all i strongly believed in that statement .as the time pass , transportation and different ways of transporting is being improved and while improving it is being cheaper .what improvements the transportation can see ; subways , busses , railways with comfortable trains , planes , jet planes etc .why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper ; because with supply and demand balances in the economy , wth the increased numbers in cars increases demand in fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is a fossil energy .as a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased .so people will choose to transport by bus by subway or unbelievable but expected by plane .because by improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles .i think it is an obvious choice : if you have chanceto go to your work by subway ; you will go to your work by subway .it is why ; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling .on the other hand people choices will change while travelling along the cities ; people prefer to use planes to go to antalya from istanbul or from antalya to istanbul - from a metropol city to a touristic city of turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car .because for making another guess ; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all .time is a valuable thing now ; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay the plane ticket for not being late for the life .in all these respects above ; transportation will see great changes in the aspect of the people lives .these changes will be rooted from the improvements in the transportation vehicles and economic conditions for instance in the fuel oil people faced .as a result for making a guess `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today
