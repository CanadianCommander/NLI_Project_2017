the textbooks in which the students study with are listed with facts .most of them can not be taught by the students themselves without full understanding of the content .by this fact , other examples and personal experiences , i have been convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .our current society requires students to use their knowledge effectively later in their life .by just learning facts , they can not understand the basic concept and idea to make their knowledge useful .our current society is advancing rapidly to fit our needs and wants .in order to keep the advancement , the students need to understand the concepts rather than facts .if , for example , a student learns only the fact that one plus one equals to two , and two times four is equal to eight , the student will only learn the answer of that problem without any progress .the society works the same .students must learn the major concepts and ideas in order to progress later in life .another reason is from my personal experience .while i was studying the political science , i could only memorize the facts and could not understand the concepts .in the test that occurred a day later , i could only answer the questions which were exactly same as the sentences stated in the textbook .i requested the professor for a retake .when i asked my father , who has a job involving politics , he gave me the basic concepts of politics and how it worked .consequently , i was abled to get a perfect score in the same subject the next day .only with the knowledge of the concept rather than facts can one to put it in various solutions to methods .by just learning the facts , one can only earn one fact .by learning the ideas and concepts , however , one can use it into various methods and eventually aquire numerous facts .therefore , i beleive it is crucial for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than facts .
