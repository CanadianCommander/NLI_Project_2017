our education system is always being criticized because of its non-analytic education .for example students learn something without even asking questions about the facts and the ideas of it .they just learn .however , it s important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .at first , i will try to summarize the advantages and the essential parts of understanding ideas .ideas and concepts are the first steps of creation .giving the ideas of an event or a problem forces the student to think aboout it .as a result , the student not only asks questions about the event , but also takes it further by trying to make an explanation to the cause of the event .this is what is called analytic reflection .for instance , we can talk about the exam in turkey before graduating from college .we study for 2 years or more without understanding the main ideas .consequently our future depends on one single test .on the other hand , learning facts is also important but not as important than understanding the essential .if a student is only learning facts , he ca nt get any further than providing simple relations between events or comparing them .he just ca nt figure out why .but a student wh understood the concepts can ask questions , `` why ? , who ? , what ? , where ?.he can eventually answer them too .we can see this as an escalade .the ideas help us to get to the top , while the facts help us to see two steps beyond .in conclusion , both systems are important .they help making progresses to the students  view of aspects .however for me , understanding the ideas and concepts are more important .they provide an analytic reflection .
