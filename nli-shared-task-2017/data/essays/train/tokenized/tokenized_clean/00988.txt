i think it depends on people because there are many kinds of young people , but i think many young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree this points .i would like to explain why i thought nowadays many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .i have two reasons for that .young people are very busy nowadays .they do not have freetime , so they have no time to helping their communities .first , they have to study hard for getting good mark on the test or pass the entrance exams .for example , they go to private school after their school for studying .of course , they will be smart and they can get good mark , but they do not have free time .second , recently many young people have part time job .after school , they go to work , part time job , for making money .then they do not have free time , so they can not have time for helping their communities .nowadays young people stay home .there are many things which can do inside .for example , computers and games .first , computers can give many things to them .computers give many informations , so young people do not get feeling bore at computers .second , there are many games in the world .young people can play game by them selves and it is fan .they can get fun from many things , so they stay home .in conclusion , nowaday many young people do not give enough time to halping their communities because they are too busy to work on studying or part time job .then there are many things which can do inside , so they stay at home .i think this sistuation is not good because people should help thier communities each other .i home young people realize it .
