people can be successful in many fields such as arts , sports , or study .in my opinion , successful people have enthusiasm that leads them to try and achieve something that seems challenging while other are just being lazy .as if there is a saying ,  no pain , no gain ..first of all , i would like to say that people who are successful are challenging taking risks .in my country , there was a famous swimmer .he was very famous , especially when he was young .he used to take all of the medals from the competitions and was considered as the best swimmer in my country .he was very eager to try the father distance to swim .after he retired , despite his age ( 40 ) he tried to swim across the river in korea .the river was the biggest in seoul , and the every scenes were being aired on tv .even though he looked very hard , people could see that he would success to swim across the river .after the success , he tried another river and also to the island near the mainland .actually , after that , he failed by tireness and long distances , but he kept trying to achieve his goal with his challening spirits .secondly , successful people have common in their willngness .what i mean by that is that people who are successful have strong wills .there is a singer who is very famous in korea and asia .when i saw him first , he was ugly .many people thought that he would probably not be popular and quit the job as a singer .but his capability to dance and sing was so amazing that people were surprized .after getting popularity , he had lots of interviews and he used to say that even if he is ugly , he promised himself that he would success as a singer by his talents .now he is a attractive and talented singer in asia .he never gave up and strived to become a singer despite the people around him who used to oppose him to become a singer .in a conclusion , successful people have their strong will and challening spritis in common as explained above .even if people know how to do something well , if they just lose their enthusiasm , it wo nt certainly lead to a success .people need to take the strong will before giving up .
