in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first of all today s research - and with it - education has come so far in so much different academic subjects that it is even difficult to be a specialist in one topic .and because of this , with broad knowledge you do nt have any clue from under the surface regarding any topic .you would be a generalist in many subjects , but in no one a specialist .but in nowadays job situation you compete mostly with specialits - especially in research .and so i think for most of the jobs in economy you have to be a specialist .a controller in finance for instance .or an expert for girafs in a safary zoo .you would be right to doubt this for jobs in general .for example a head of a company should also have broad knowledge of many subjects , because he has his specialists working for and reporting to him .however , for many jobs it is better to be a specialist rather than being a generalist .that is also one reason , why education changed in the last decades .another reason for specializing in knowledge is that you do one subject right and get ` deep  insider informations and skills in it .you ca nt do that for a wide variety of subjects .so you are an expert in one topic , because you learned and trained yourself to a large extend .that makes you quite useful as an advisor for other people and an interesting speaking partner .and this also has an positive effect to your psyche .because you know you are needed by your friends and customers not just for your personality or personal relationship to those people , but also for your special knowledge and experience .
