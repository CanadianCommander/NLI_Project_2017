science , for that matter any other field of study , have been broadly classified in to many subjects .its important for everone to have a basic knowledge of all these subjects but i think its better to specialize in one specific subject .concentrating on a wide range of subjects creates a lot of problems .firstly , the individual may not be able to find ample time to devote to each subject .secondly , the reader may retain far less than what is required because the details of the mix of all subjects might be really confusing .we always find that people who make their decisions early and act promptly and concentrate in a particular area of interest turn out to be high performers or high end achievers contributing a lot towards the development of society .dr. a.p.jabdul kalam , the president of india can be quoted as a very relevant example in this context .dr. kalam identified very early that his interest lies in the area of space science and technology and started working on it from his senior seondary school itself .we all know that he had always been a towering figure in the evolution of indian space programme ever since he joined the indian space research organization .he can be a real role model to the young students .i do feel that an exposure to all the subjects is essential for a student to make the right choice .it also gives him the confidence to tackle new situations and to effectively put forward a new idea before the general public .but ultimately one should try to become a specialist in any field of his interest .in this society i feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is working to make the other people listen their voice .it also generates a sense of belief among them over the things he or she is telling them .i feel its always better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all .
