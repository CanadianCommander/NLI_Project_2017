certainly some people think that young persons seldom participate and help the communities these days .but personally i believe that the education and society give young people the chance and the time to have a contact with communities to help other people .first , the school focuses on the importance of volunteer works in the community these days , so that students give their more time to do volunteer works than before .for example , when i was in high school , the teachers set up the volunnteer commitee which give the information and chance to do volunteer works in the hospital to clean the rooms .in addition , the school produced the event that students pick up the trash around the school once a week .the experience of attending the volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students .that experience give me the chance to have a contact with my community .i was very busy at studying , but i have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities .according to the newspaper , the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer works these days .this example demonstrates that schools make enough oppotunity for students to help their communities .second , the community have a chance to young people to help their communities .for instance , in tokyo , where i live , the number of the trouble of robbers and fire accidents caused by people is increasing .therefore , in my town , the commitee of the town decide to ask youg people to look around the town to protect the accidents during the night .i attend this activity once a week .this example also shows that the young poeple have a time to help the community because of their needs to defense by themselves .i can understand the opinion that young people are busy of studing and eager to play the tv game , so that they seldom help their community .however , the schools and communiries make enough time and chance for young generations to help their community .therefore , i definetly disagree with the statement that young persons do not use their time to helping their communities .
