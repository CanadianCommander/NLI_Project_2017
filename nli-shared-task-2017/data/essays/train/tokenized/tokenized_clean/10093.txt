although some people may think an advertised product is really typical to its form in the advertisements , i believe that products look much better in advertisements than they do in reality .my opinion is based on several experiences and examples .first , it is a known fact that all advertisers tend to show their product as the best in the market , a tendency that is increased by the increased competition among producers .so , any producer will only show the advantages of his product and disregard its disadvantages .for example , an advertisement for a certain product will only show people who were satisfied with the product , and allow them to give a lengthy explanation of how the product changed their lives , even though the product may have no impact on a person s life at all , such as dog food , and in many cases the person talking in the advertisement has not even seen the product .an important point to consider when watching an advertisement is the size of a product , which is , not surprisingly , larger in the advertisement than it really is .so , a burger sandwich could be nearly as large as a pizza , and similarly , a piece of furniture , such as a table or a chair or a desk can be misleadingly large in an advertisement .another example is shampoo .an advertisement for shampoo will show girls with silky hair , giving the impression that this particular brand of shampoo will make the curliest hair more nourished and healthy .another technique that misleads the customers in an advertisement is to show people , and in some cases celebrities , using the product and having a great time , which gives the consumer the impression that buying the proct will make him feel happier .since we are all searching for happiness , many people may be encouraged to buy the product .personally , i have had several disappointing experiences with advertisements .i have bought bags , clothes and even furniture after watching misleading advertisements on tv and reading great customer reviews for products on the internet , which turn out to be much less satisfying than they are portrayed .i have to admit that some of the products were good , but still not as good as they appeared in the advertisements .the problem associated with the fact that products may sometimes seem better in advertisements than they really are is exacerbated by the use of the internet for shopping , where the consumer buys a product without actually seeing it .still , advertisements are interesting and do provide important information about products , we just have to learn to think before we buy .
