i completely disagree with the statement that state : `` successful poeple try new things and take risks rathen then only doing what they already know how to do well  , because the criteria to be successful person doesnt depend only in doing new things that no one did before .in opinion , that doing ordinary thing is better for many reasons .firstly it more safety , for example , trying to fix electrical equipment even if its very simple , will be dangaer if there no enough information how to fix it .second reason is saving money , for instance if you trying to take risk of something not ordinary such as throw yourself from high building to small swimming pool , may leads to break some of your bones and get ingured , if the risk didnt be seccesful , so you will spend the money in vesiting hospitals and doctors .other reason for holding is opinion , that is waste of time , so trying to do something thet you know it very well will reduce the time to trying do something no one did before .although some poeple argued that doing some thing new is criterial of successful person , for example , discovery of useful and good invention is successful , such as invention of light by adison .however , nobel invent the bomb , but i can not consider him as successful person because he invent awful thingin sum , in my view the successful person who do successful work , even if the work is well known .
