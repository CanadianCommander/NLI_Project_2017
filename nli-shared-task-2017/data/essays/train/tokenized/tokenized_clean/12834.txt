i agree that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .since the oil is running out , the cars , in the future , would be less valued and sought than in the past and present , also there are increasing demand for private helicopters or airplanes by which people can save the time of waiting for the traffic congestions .furthermore , the public transportations would be incredibly convenient and easily accessible to the extent that people only prefer to use the whole of them .first of all , in less than twenty years , the oils would run out and the oil-required cars would be completely replaced by the electric cars .however , the electric cars have tons of problems associated with their speed , efficiency of the electricity , and so on .considering this fact , i think that many people would prefer to find other ways of accessing to the place they want .second , more public focuses and interests are being given to the private helicopters or airplanes .somewhat wealthy people might already possess one or even two .there are several reasons why people prefer to own private helicopters or mini airplanes .in recent societies , the most prevalent is the vehicles on the road and the most rampant one is also the vehicles on the road , which causes lots of traffic congestions and sometimes even the high ways are jammed .there is no single family that does not own their private vehicles .also , the traffic accidents are incredibly increasing and many people are deceasing without any guilt .some or many people are toxicated or drunken during their drives .no matter how bad condition the person hit by their cars is lying on , or no matter how softly the cars were crashed with each other , the up-coming consequences are strikingly huge that they even can drop the person down the hell , or topple the person with his all authorities and properties .third , the public transportations are remarkably advancing as the public interests on them are focused more and more .many people prefer the public transportations to their private vehicles , because they do not have to be late in their working sites due to the harsh traffic congestions .the well-designed schedule , which does not change from time to time but stays the constant , guarantees them of the time of arrival to their working places .to sum up , i think there would fewer cars in use in twenty years because of the reasons i mentioned above .in my personal case , since i tend to be late at my school and i m not the typical student who are very organized and scheduled in time , i prefer to get my private helicopter in the future .
