travelling is a good choice to spend weekends and vacations .however , one is usually faced by the decision : `` is it better to make it on my own or within a group led by a tour guide ?.apart from the extreme points of view that are either `` individualistic  favoring doing everything alone , or `` extremely sociable  favoring having everything done in a group ; i believe that the correct decision to this problem depends on the situation .to clarify what i mean by this , let me cite an example .suppose that you are planning to go to egypt or greece for instance to watch the ancient monuments and museums there .this kind of travelling is known as cultural tourism .then , it may seem reasonable in such a case to travel in a group led by a tour guide .after all , being alone may prevent you from making full benefit of the trip .for example , you will not be able to know exactly what the most important histroical sites are , and what their history was .in such a case , a tour guide will provide you with a valuable experience ( let s assume he is a knowledgeable guy ! ) .without explanation from somebody , you will most probably be unable to understand and hence appreciate the monuments .but does this imply that it is `` always  better to travel in a group led by a tour guide ?absolutely no !in many situations , travelling alone will provide you with a space of freedom you might need .suppose , you are going to washington d.c. to watch the significant historical sites there .since the sites are really diverse , ranging from musuems of science and technology to museums of modern art , it may seem unlikely that you can really enjoy it if you travel in a group .people have different tastes , and what the tour guide will probably do is to divide the time evenly between all the sites to cover everything so that no one will be unsatisfied .the problem as you may infer is that , this way , in fact , nobody will be satisfied , since everyone will find himself `` forced  to go to places he almost hates , then spends only 5 minutes or so in places he really likes the most .so fianlly , in making the decision of travelling in a group or alone , one should consider the situation !having an ex ante point of view might not be objective !
