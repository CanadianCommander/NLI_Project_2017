some people say that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do .however , personally , i disagree this opinion .i think that older people can enjoy life more than yonger people .i will give you some reasons to support my choice .my primary reason is that older people have more time and money for enjoying their life than yougers .youger people , like studesnts have a lot of things that they have to do .so i don  t think that they have much time for spending life really .in fact , now i m studing arts at the bunsai college .in bunsai collefe students learn arts and english every day .teachers both arts and english at bunsai always give us a lot of assinments .so students always are busy .they also can not have a little part time job .as a resolt , we have no time and no money .this every day life gives students strong stress .other reason is that older people have more experiences than yonger people , so i think that they know real good things for enjoy life .for exsample , i have a lot of kind of interesting things .for example , drawing picture , dancing , singing a song , i want to try to everthings .but time is limited .i think that older peple will be able to chooce a best way rapidry .as a reult , they can spend time usefully .therefore , i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
