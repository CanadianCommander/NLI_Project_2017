everytime you watch a science-fiction movie which is supposed to take place in the 21st century , you ca nt help but notice that all the cars seems to have been replaced by super space-ships , teleportation devices and similar revolutionary things .but this is the 21st century , and apparently cars are still holding on , even though we sometimes find their presence questionable seeing the global oil crisis and the environmental problems .are cars going to become less and less used until they disappear ?i rather think that the car as we know it is about to go through a major change , which does nt obviously means its end : it just needs to adapt to the world s new conditions .first of all , it seems rather clear that in a few years , 50 or so , there wo nt be any oil left for us to extract .what will we do when our ressources are out ?it s going to be a huge problem for cars , because they ca nt work without oil .will we have to abandon them for another means of transport , one based on a different carburant ?well , maybe we just need to find a way to make cars work with something else .actually , the process has already started : more and more cars are built as to work with oil combined with a natural product .in the future , it may be possible that oil wo nt be needed at all , and therefore we will be able to keep on using as many cars as nowadays .still , another problem remains : what about the environment ?while people buy more and more cars , it has become obvious that the quality of the air in big cities like bombay or paris has been increasingly dreadful .the solution seems to be to forbid the use of car in those cities , and to use instead other means such as the subway .but wo nt the problem be solved if we find a new carburant for cars , one that does nt pollute the atmosphere ?once again , this possibility is already studied by many scientists in the world , and it might come true one day .as a conclusion , i would then say that there really is a need to change the way cars work if we want to keep using them .it s their quality , not their quantity , which has to be modified : they will still exist in 20 years , but maybe under a different form .
