the issue at hand is `` young people enjoy life more than older people  .i agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in so many ways .i want to give some of the examples why i agree with this statement .the first reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is because young people have lot of energy than older people .for enjoying life it is not suffient having money , enregy also require a lot .for example travelling different countries gives so much of enjoy to us .for travelling different countries money will not sufficient , lot of energy also required .but in older people they have less energy and they can not travel such long journies .in this way young people have more advantages to the older people .another reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is that younger people can get lot of entertainment in so many ways which older people can not enjoy .for example going to the discos and watching late night movies and playing games .but the older people are not intersted in watching late night movies , going to discos and playing games .this is the other way that older people miss alot .furthermore , some young people are enjoying life by concentrating on his job or any bussines work .some people are enjoying life by developing their companys and bussines development .inorder to develop their growth for their work , so much of concentation , patience could require .the advantages for young people is they can produce lot of concentration , patience .but in older people , they have very less patience and they can not concentrate for long time .in this way also young people are more advantage than older people to enjoy life .finally , for all the above reasons i have mentoined , i want to say that i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in many ways , however i mentoined some of these advantages to younger people for enjoying life .
