the word community includes every single creature in a particular area .this categorzation of communities is based on some of the following like caste , religion , workplace , age etc. , the examples are like brahmin community in inida , hindu community , infosys development community and senior citizens community respectively .i agree with the statement that young people these days are not spending enough time in helping their communities .firstly , young people particularly of teenaged are busy in their studying activites as they feel it is most important to get higher grades in their is more important to them which would help them in having a good life at a later point of time .for example younger ones who are studying in the semi-residential schools are forced to spend most of their time in school or college which would make him difficult to attend the helping work because of the fullday busy schedule .secondly , with the advance of technology in various fields has reduced the need for younger ones to help others in their community particularly the elders among them .for example in older days where if a elderly person in a community desire to write a letter , he would take help a younger one for writing .but , with the advent of phone the necessity of a younger to help the aged-citizen is avoided .thirdly and importantly the selfishness feeling among the younger ones has changed their minds to deny help to any one in the community .although mutual co-ordination is important in a communtiy for good relations among the people in it , it is given least importance than it should be given only because of the feeling of selfishness .for example , a younger would like to lend his belongings if and only if the person he is lending is offering something in return to what he has given .lastly self-enjoyment is considered important these days which is preventing a younger to help his community in some way or the other .for example one would prefer to enjoy in an event organised by someone else rathre than to organise the event for others .finally , with all the above mentioned reasons the younger ones are not able to spend enough in helping the communities in which they live around .
