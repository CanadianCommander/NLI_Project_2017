it is a fact that cars are parts of our daily lives .and you can not deny that we do need them , but if we will look in the furture ; are there going to be more or less cars used by human beings in twenty years ?i would say that there wo nt be many cars left on streets worldwide , for the following reasons .firstly , technic and its experts constantly develope new technologies .who knows which transport possibilities are there going to be in twenty years ?nobody of the nineteenth century had ever dared thinking that humans are going to fly or even fly to the moon in the twentieth century .may be all people are not driving anymore in the future , but they are flying with little u-boats ?secondly , as our environment is nearly totally damaged due to pollution and cars , i do hope that people will recognise how important our environment is , and will forget about using cars .without any doubt it is the car industry which is mostly responsible for the damage made on earth .if people do nt stop polluting our environment , there wo nt be an earth left where we can life .and thirdly , cars are expensive .they are even so expensive that people can hardly afford them .and the cars industry is definetly not making cars to be good for the environment , but to make profit .and this situation is not about to change in the future .on the other hand , we need our cars .without having a car your daily life will turn into chaos .we are completly depending on them if we want to go shopping , go to work or even if we want to go on holidays .the argument of people being lazy does support the idea of cars being part of human lives , even stronger .nobody really wants to walk , if there is a change of driving to a place .finally , a car is simply a symbol of wealth .most people do own two or three expensive cars just to show that they , in contrast to others , can afford having expensive cars .as a conclusion , i am convinced that cars are helpful and will always be helpful in the future .but what consequences might there be if we do not reduce the use of them ?
