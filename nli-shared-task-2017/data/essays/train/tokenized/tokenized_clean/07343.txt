although the argument has been made that travel with tour guide is best way to go to somewhere , in my point of view , i would like to travel without tour guid and some people .when i go to a travel as a group , i always have some problems about where will we go to next and why theyto begin with , without some people and tour guid , i may not go to some places where i would like to go and take some pictures .if i travel with some people and tour guid , i can go to that places and i have to follow the routs that the tour guid lead .in addtion , the tour may not provide the places where i want to go so that the tour may be waste of money .if i have a chance to travel famous place , i want to chose places myself .second reason i should mention is that i have to take care of a lot of people .this is great stress to take care of all opinion and use a lot of energy , so that i can not enjoy my travel .and also , there must be some troubles among people .for instance , people dislike the tour that we will travel tomorrow , that people criticize the tour guid .and also , when people do not arrive on the time , we may miss some events which is very famous at place where we visit .therefore , when we travel and visit a lot of people , we have to have some risks as travel the tour .considering all of above factors , i disagree this statement that travel with group of people and guid tour is best way to visit somewhere because of some risks for people and following guid s direction .
