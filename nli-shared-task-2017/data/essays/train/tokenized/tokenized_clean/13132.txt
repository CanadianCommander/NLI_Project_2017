success has always been an important topic in people s daily conversation .but what do people think of most of the time when they discuss success .the answer can vary but could be restricted to great achievements .but who can achieve success and will never be successful ?`` no risk , no gain  , i would have put it .since centuries it has been proved that people with broader initiatives and people who dare take risks are the mostv succesful .every person has unlimited potentials to succeed in this world but the difference between people lie on how ready they are to embark on new initiatives without making to many calculations you can not know you potentials and limits untill they put yourself in a situation where you can really assess what you are capable of and where your abilities stop .you can enjoy success if you are not willing to take risks .the first europeans that landed in america were ambitious and wanted a better life .so they take the risk to leave every thing behind and challenge the mercyless oceans and savage forests filled with wild animals .those people became happier than their fellows they had left behind .those who dared not challenge the rough waves of the sea , remained there and had to face all kind of bad treatments .if you find yourself in the teaching field with tremendous abilities to understand several languages but you still choose to teach for fear you might find yourself employed once you leave
