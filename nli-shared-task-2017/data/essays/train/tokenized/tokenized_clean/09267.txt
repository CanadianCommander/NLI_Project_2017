i agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do .in hte modern society , there are more and more entertaining resorts for young people to enjoy .such as wonderland in canada , bars and club .the most important thing is young people s ages and hearts .as the economics increase all over the world , everything is changing .the buildings , people s dresssing , cultures , fashioness , and transportation .the reason the world is developing is all because the way modern thinking are changing .people s lives are getting better and better every day , especially young people , since they live more in modern society .they have not esperienced the life during wartime .for example , the american scientific engineers are focusing on project about the building the longest abd excited train in the world .the train is very similar to the one we often play in wonderland .and of courses it is more likely oftered to young people .i actually do nt that pld people can not go to that train to experience the happiness and excitedment .but use our common to think about it , if we do a survey in a city , we can calculate the percentage , how much percent of old people like to go to those places to have fun compare to young people ?even though they actually go , i believe they will bring the kids or grandchildren there .this is another example , in north america , they build more and more bars and clubs only for young people , but for this situation , they have age limit , from age sixteen to eighteen .this is a very vivid example shows that the society cares about the young people about enjoying their lives and have fun .however , we do care about the old people as well .they would like to enjoy their lives and have fun too .but the way they enjoy their lives compare to young people , it is more silent .instead going to those resorts , they rather just invite some friends to their houses to have some drink or just watch newpapers at home .in then modern society , young people really enjoy life more than old people .
