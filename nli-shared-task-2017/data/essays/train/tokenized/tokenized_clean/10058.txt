i agree with the statement because to me undeerstanding is the most important factor in learing for univerisity .the first reason is that if you understand an idea it is easier to remember it and the idea stays in mind longer than than a learned fact .secondly i find it important to be able to apply the learned knowledge to other situations and study areas .one should be able to adopt the learned features and work with them .understanding is very important for ideas you have to remember not only for a specific examination but for a long time .they stay in mind because you can imagine how the idea works .although you can be sucessful in an exam just by learing the facts you will not be able to remember them later .the most important reason why i prefer understanding is that facts which are understood can be adopted to your work .for example an engineer who knows how to build an engine but does not understand how it works will never be able to invent new feature to the engine , but someone who undestands the priciples of an engine will be able to improve it .this can be easily transferred to any other subject .so a psycholigist has to understand the theories of disorders , e.g. a depression , in order to help his patient .if he does not understand it he can only tell the patient more details on his disorder but can not transfer the information to the individual .so this doctor is no real use to the patient because the patient can easily find these information in books .if you understand a certain technique it is easy even to transfer it to completely different study field .it can help you to learn and understand even topics which are not related .the given reasons are only a few reason why understandind is the more effective learning method .besides there are many other advantages of understanding ideas .so for example learning can be a lot more interesting when you understand the ideas .it can be motivating and learning can be more fun .
