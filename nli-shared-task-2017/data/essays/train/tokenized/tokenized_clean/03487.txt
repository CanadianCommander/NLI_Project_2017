well , according to me it depends on the real time situation .sometimes its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one subject .for example to make a living a person should be able to adapt himself in any kind of working atmosphere .suppose , mr.x has done his graduation in say , chemical engineering , it doesnt guarntee him a job in chemical or any related industry cause its hard to get a job in the chemical industry as the number of employees required are fewer compared to the it industry .if mr.x has learnt basics about computer , which is usually thought in undergraduation school , then his chance of getting a job in a it industry is more compared to chemical .it industry do require chemical engineers to deal with the clients related to chemical background and he can do a great job in understanding the problems of the client .so , his broad knowledge about all his academics subject can get him a job .one more example , lets talk about a paediatrician , a person ( doctor ) specialized to treat children problems .well he is much more familiar to diseases of a child than a grown up .suppose , he is travelling in a train , and suddenly there s some problem to an accompaning passenger who is a grown up/elder person .as a doctor his duty is to look at the problem of the person rather than saying i m a child specialist .at this instance of time a broad knowledge on his academic subjects could help give a immediate initial remedy to the person before he is taken to a hospital .at times you need to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge about all his academic subjects .for example a person specialized in nuclear engineering and working in a nuclear power plant .well , its a must to have a specialization in that one subject subject rather than having a broad knowledge about his other academic subjects like sugar technology , petroleum engg .. , etc. , because he is responsible for the processes going on in the plant , and any problem can cause great havoc .at this situation its worth to have a specialization in one subject .i , conclude by saying that it really depends on the job , the atmosphere one is working into have specialization in one subject or to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
