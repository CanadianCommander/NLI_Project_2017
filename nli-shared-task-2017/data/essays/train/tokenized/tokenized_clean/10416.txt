the environment is suffering from all the air pollution , that leads to a warmer earth climate .this has already the effect that poles are starting to melt .that is why the protection of the environment is becoming more and more important and everyone is getting aware of the dangers and risks we are provoking .everyone means mainly people in first world countries because the developing countries usually cope with other severe problems first .the worlds population is increasing exponentially .developing countries strive to achive a life standard equivalent to the first world countries .some , such as india for instance , are getting closer to this objective .they work very hard to participate in the world trade and in forming a strong economy .they attempt also to raise their life standard and this includes the purchase of cars .in first world countries a car is a sign of wealth and independence .as long as there are no further inventions to replace cars this will not change in such a short time as 30 years .maybe the gas will change to renewable resources but in the end a car means more comfort and independence and that is what nowbody wants to give up .that is why i do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
