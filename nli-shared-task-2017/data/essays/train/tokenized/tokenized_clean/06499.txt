i strongly disagree with the statement given .it is not good to have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects .a broad knowledge will not get you good grades in the examination at school .everyone has heard the famous saying `` jack of all trades but master of none  .also little knowledge is a dangerous thing .it can infact endanger a person s life .for example while doing the cpr technique to resuscitate a dying person you need to have the complete knowledge about the procedure , otherwise you can put his or her life in danger .another place where the specialized knowledge is useful is the `` school of life  .having a specialized knowledge can create a great career oppurtunity .this can translate into a prosperous and comfortable life .another point to be considered is that people who have a broad knowledge about many subjects are generally restless people who can not concentrate long enough on any subject to master it .this loss at concentrating will result in failure at every stage in their life .this will make them a complete loser .also people who have specialized knowledge will make a positive impression on their kids .this will result in highly inspired kids who will then become able and successful adults .these kids will in turn produce another great generation .in fact specialized knowledge can transform a dismal or moderate nation into a truly great one .this is the stuff winners are made of .a broad knowledge will only take you so much far , but to go that extra mile you need to have a something `` extra  .this extra is specialized knowledge .in the end i would like to say that it is really much better to have specialized knowledge about a subject than to have little knowledge about everything under the sun .go for specialized knowledge guys , it is certainly worth it .
