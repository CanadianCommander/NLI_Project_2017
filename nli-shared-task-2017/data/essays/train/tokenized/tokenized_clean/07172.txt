the statement that s exposed on the left is an important point of the own life of every person .i think the that statement rappresents the two large kind of person in the world : the successful people and the normal people .as like as the statement , successful people try new things and take risk .instead normal people only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with the sentence .in my opinion trying new things it s the best way to grow your personality .however a different point of view to the same thing can open your mind , and open to you different way to resolve any problems .in 1492 cristoforo colombo went to america and come back .he was a successful person becouse takes risks in his adventure .since 1492 , the conseguences of his choice during still today and past the ages .today his name is in the most popular history books around the world .the different between colombo and a normal person it s in his choice , it s in his point of view .to be a successful person we have to fallow the colombo s choice in our own life .if we are going to do only the things that we know how to do well we probably remain normal persons .in my personal experience i can see the meaning of the statemet that i exposed before .the person who free its mind going to be a successful person .at school , but not at all , this concept is more understandably .a large part of students study on book and do nt practice what they have learned .the proffessor gives to students a basic formation , that they can enlarge only trying new thing and new experience out of the school buildings .a successful student , like a successful person , has to try some different experience in his life to the complete formation of himself and to become a successfuf
