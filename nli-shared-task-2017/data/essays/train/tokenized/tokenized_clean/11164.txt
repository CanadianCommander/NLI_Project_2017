to answer the question if there will be fewer cars in twenty years is not very simple .there are various factors which might or will play a role in this development .in the following i will try to explain my point of view on this topic .if the useage of natural resources and especially oil will continue in the next two decades there might be a lack of petrol quite soon .but using up so much oil would also mean to continue wasting our environment tremendously .a lack of oil would probably cause an increase of the fuel prizes up to the point where only very few people are able to even afford it .this development might lead to a thinking away from the philosophy that every household needs at least one car to a more money-saving one of using public transportation systems instead .in this case the number of cars would of course decrease .but i think it is more likely that other resources will be used to provide energy to run a car ( for example gas or electricity from renewable resources ) .this would mean that there will be no considerable change in the number of used cars .another posibility is that due to the polution of our indespensable air the people s awereness of their environment will increase .this could possibly have the effet to make people think more sustainable about the question whether they need a car or not .if people are aware of the causes polution has on our atmosphere they might be willed to find different - maybe more uncomfortable - ways of transportation .but in my opinion i do not think that this mental change will take place - at least not in the next twenty year .to sum it up , i think that the number of cars used is hardly going to change unless it gets either unaffordable for most people - so they are forced to use public transportations - or an awerness of our nature arouses in the peoples mind which makes them willed to benfit their environment not regarding their lose of comfort .
