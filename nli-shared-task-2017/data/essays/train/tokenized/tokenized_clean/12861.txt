as far as different concepts for education in school are concerned it s still a great issue if learning facts or understanding ideas should have the main priority .the given statement says that to understand ideas is more important than to learn facts .i personally agree with this statement .these are my main points :at first facts can be read in books , thus also be looked up .in our age , when information is so easy accessible ( one could mention the internet here ) , i think the importance of remembering facts is much lower then it perhaps once was .on the other hand it is very difficult to read ideas in books because it is part of the essence of ideas that one must have understood them once if he wants to remember them an use them later .that leads me to my second point : facts can only hardly be remembered .i personally often had to learn a large amount of facts ; and i forgot them only a few days later .concerning ideas , that is not the problem .once unterstood , ( this is truly necessary , as already mentioned ) certain ideas can be remembered a long time after one had learned them .but there is another important point that has to be mentioned .learning ideas helps to create own ideas .once the structure of a certain idea or argumentation is understood , the student might be able to adapt those structures in his own way of thinking .in the end this is definitely one condition for maturation and responsibility .just learning facts wo nt help you to think on your own , perhaps not even to use those facts in a new situation .to put it in a nutshell , i definitey agree with the statement .thougt there are certain cases in which knowing facts is quite essential , e.g. as history as a subject is concerned .i think it s not possible to dicuss this issue argueing just for one of the mentioned concepts .but refering to the thesis , just saying that it is more important to understand ideas , i can agree .
