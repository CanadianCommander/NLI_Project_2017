since the younger people have more energy , some may argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .personally , i disagree with the statement .i belive that the older people have better understanding of life and therefore are capable to enjoy their life more .first , as people get older they experience different situations and learn various things .older people tend to know more about how life works and be capable of accepting things as they are .younger people , on the other hand , tend to complain about their lives more .they are always dissatisfied with their lives and things happening around them .they spend more time on questioning and complaining about things than on accepting things and moving on .older people , having experienced in different situation , can look at things more objectively and move on faster .second , younger people spend more time on different things such as studying and working than the older people .young people are often too busy trying to achieve what they want to take a closer look at their life and understand what they really need for their lives .in the novel , tuesdays with morrie by mitch albom , for expample , morrie , the old professor who was dying , tells the reader how young people tend to waste their time trying to earn more money when what they really need is each other .as people get older , they learn the valuable things in their lives and tend to enjoy theri life more than the younger ones who are often stressed out about their jobs or status .finally , one may argue that young people often are capable of spending their time and engergy on doing something wild and therefore can enjoy their life more .who says doing something wild is the only way to enjoy one s life ?sitting around at home and having a relaxing converstion with some friends could be more enjoyable than trying to jump off a bridge with a rope attached to oneself .
