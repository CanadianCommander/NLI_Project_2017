in teaching of studends , there is always doubts and discussions about the teaching manner .somebody think that for a student , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is tor them to learn facts .my personal idea is that both sides should be learned by students .firstly , the facts are the bases for the ideas and concepts .ideas and concepts should be supported by facts , so that facts have to be learned as well .for example , a teacher should tell the story of euclide in finding euclide theorem to the stuents .by this way , the student can think and imagine the conditions of the time that euclide lived , and he can remember euclide s situation while he is working on a new concept or what did he worked on while finding the theorem .unless knowing these sittuation , it is so har to use euclide theorem in anywhere .thus , telling the story of euclide make the lesson much enjoyable and funny to listen .secondly , facts and ideas , concepts can not be separated each other by the means of completition .these three elements are completing each other .an airplane designer can not design a new wing concept unless knowing how the factors will be when the plane fly , in a snowy weather or cloudy weather etc .it is very hard to understad a subject without the facts is very hard for students .if you want to teach the results of world war ii , you should tell the situations again .knowing only where did france captured , where did britain captured or which new countries are formed are all informations to be forgotten .you should tell where did these countries fighted , or why they are fighted for that , with facts , could be better to teach .as you can see , there is a lot of connections between ideas , concepts and facts .facts can not be separated by the other two .teaching is a complete job and facts are supporting for ideas , concepts .
