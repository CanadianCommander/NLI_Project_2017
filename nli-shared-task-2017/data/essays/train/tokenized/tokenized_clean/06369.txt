the landscape of our cityes has completely changed in the last 100 years .during the last century our grandparents were used to move through the city with horses or just by walk .but after the introduction of the car , and also the blast of economy in our country , our parents were the first to buy a car for their family , instead of a charriot .the industrial and economical revolution is keeping to let us think that we need more technology in our daily activityes , but i m not so sure .i really think that we actually can not controll the rise of our factoryes and also the pollution that they produce .at the same level i do nt think that we can stop the industrial revolution and the idea that `` we are reaching the perfect society  as they would like to teach us .this is why i really think that is quite unreal that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in our streets .i concour with those who think that the numbers of cars are going to increase in number without control , especially those cars that are particularly made for specific purposes , such as the city cars .i live in rome , where we are actually almost 4 millions of people , and i think to be right when i say that every family owns a car , sometimes more than one .in the last 5 years in rome we have been witnesses in the introduction of a new type of car called `` smart  .this car looks like a toy .it  s small , compact , coloured , and the most important fact is that it s easy to parck , due to its small dimensions .the fact is that in rome we actually have almost 400.000 of these small cars in the streets .once i have read an article on a german newspaper that showed this phenomenon .the fact is that all the big factoryes that produced this small cars , that by the way is designed by mercedes , are closing worldwide .smart factoryes are out of business in china , germany , france , but not in italy .in fact in italy , of course mostly in the big cityes , the problem of the number of cars is huge .besides our governments have been so clever that in the last 10 years they have always thought that a good way to solve this problem was to economically help people in buy a new car , instead of improve the bus service or the subway lines .besides i really think that our economy is based on oil .all the principal wars worldwide are based on the oil possetion : iraq , afganistan , iran .i know that almost 20 years ago someone discovered the possibility to let our engines work with water , or alternative propellers , but still our cars work with gas .thus as long as our economy is based on oil , the number of cars will not decreased in our cityes , but they will also increased in our small towns and countrys .
