some people argue as if it was a general truth that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today , so there was no need for me to put any emphasis on what the disadvantages of cars were .but to the frank , i did not agree with the title statement .there were numorous reasons why i held no confidence on them , and i would explore only a few primary ones here .the first reason for my choice could be obviously seen that the price of the cars had been more and more cheaper in recent year .because many car companies reduced their price in order to attracting customers and got the ideal profits .and they would not care about what bad influences the cars would bring about .the second reason for this problem could be involved that people had more free money to buy cars with the improvement of living level of people .perhaps , a family with three persons had three cars for each one .moreover , in some people s mind , the cars was a sign of social position and powerful authority .of course , i also designated that the vehicles had a couple of merits , such as convinient , save time and so on , these ware the aspects of itself that could attract people to buy it .the last fact showed that the goverment did not have the laws which were relative with cars and had ever never to restrict the number of vehicles .although everybody knew that the cars would make pollute in our country , there were still so many people to buy cars and the goverment did nothing about it by laws .as far as i was concerned , i came to the notion that i did not support that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .i put my standpoint to believe that there are more vehicles in the furture .
