i strongly agree with the statement `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .students are required to understand ideas and concepts .the main reason for this is the ideas are going to increase the way they think and the concepts help them to implement their taughts .the lecturers should teach students for getting ideas for new things from there childhood .they should give some question and tell them to implement their taughts .such that their brain gets more ideas when they see or come to know about a perticular point .suppose for an example let us take a topic in mathemetics , there are many ways to solve one perticular problem .here comes picture of ideas the , student thinks in many different ways to solve a perticular problem any how , these can be implemented only by concepts but not facts .and puzzles con be solved by implementing different ideas .suppose a puzzle has many ways then only idea can help him to find the right way .facts are that which have already taken place .facts can be learned by there own .one can gather facts from newspapers , magizines and many other places .facts are implemented earlier , before facts ideas and concepts are developed , with these development of ideas and repeatly occuring of the same thing they were recorded as facts .some facts may help the student but with out concepts these fact may not be understood clearly .facts are those they are already implemented .these can be read and know about them and can implement only up to a certain level .but , when an idea is striked it can be implemented by their own knowledge using concepts .for example , scientists would read facts and keep in mind but they implement or invent new things by their own ideas and the concepts they had learned .finally , we can conclude that facts are developed from the implementation of ideas and concepts .
