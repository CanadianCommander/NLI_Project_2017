yes i agree with the statemen , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  as people gain success they experiment with new ideas and takes risks of implementing those ideas .the main purpose of this experiment is to increase their growth and success in fields other than what they already know perfectly .for most of the successful people success is not the only goal , but their goal is an increase in success with the passing time .i think risks must be taken so as to explore other fields inorder to achieve success .success of an individual depends mainly on his self confidence and his skills in adapting what he dont know .trying out something is the basic step of attaining success or failure .only after trying out something that is new people are directed towards success or failure and in case of success people try to expertise themselves in that particular field and later on try for some new things to add on to their success .an organization which is successful in providing people with a soft drink of a particular flavour will later on take a risk of trying out something new by introducing a new drink , if it fails then the drink may be withdrawn from the market but in case of success the gain a huge business and sales .success it attained by dedication , hardwork and skills , a successful person feels independent and keeps on trying new paths or ideas to increase their success .but people who dont try new ideas maintain the same position at which they are present since a long time .success is achieved by taking riks and implying new ideas , new ideas are helpful steps and a right path for people who are successful .
