with the above made statement , i fully agree for the following reasons : the best example would probably be the tobaco advertisements shown on tv , the cinema or as large posters at bus stations .nobody could say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free , but a certain brand tryes to provoke this picture by showing landscapes , cowboys and horses .another example is the food industry - what they say to be healthy often turnes out to be tho opposite , if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back .but often people do nt even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they do nt have the knowledge interpretate the meaning of what they read .of course - not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might become to our health .and that is one of the points i really think to be unfair from the froducting firms .to sell bigger quantities of their product , they willingly make believe people wrong things .especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body .they just want to do , have , eat or drink everything they are told is good , brandnew , cool .and so do their friends .concluding my essay i would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even ` most  as is written in the statement .it would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false , dishonest or dangerous .there definetly are advertisements which state the truth about their product !many adversitements even show a houmorous content and can be really amusing .- for these reasons we can see shows at tv containing the ` funniest tv spots of the world  - what an enrichement to our tv programs !
