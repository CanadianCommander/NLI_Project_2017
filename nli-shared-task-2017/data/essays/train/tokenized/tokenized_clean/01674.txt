the idea of advertisements is to help the company to sell more products .while competing with other companies , companies tend to make their products look better in their advertisements .i agree the fact that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are , but i do nt disagree with the way companies do it .the same as a movie preview , the director always want to show the most exciting part of the movie .companies tend to skip the inconviency and disadventige of their product .instead , they always show the best of their products .sometimes , the companies will use special editing and filming skills to make their product look even better .for example , when the new i-pod nano first came out in the comercial , people were amazed by its pretty disign and how small it was .however , buyers soon realized that the i-pod nano was very easy to be scrached .moreover , the i-pod nano has a very small menmory compare to other i-pods .the funny thing is that i bought a i-pod nano right after i saw the comertial .of course , the nano was not as exciting as the ones in comertial , but it was not much worse .however , i was really angry when i saw the first scrach mark on my i-pod nano .in now days , since people are living in a material word , there are many products are meant to make our life better , happier , but we do nt neccesarry need them in our dayly life such as a i-pod , cable tv , computer , fancy clothing , and more .because of these products are not neccesarry for our life , companies have to make people want to buy them and do not expect a stable market without having any advertisement .of course , since advertisements are the only way people will know these products , companies try to make them look as good as possible .therefore , most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
