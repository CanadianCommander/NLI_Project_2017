i disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .being different age stage , older people have different spirit world with the young people .firstly , old people have more abundant experience in their lives than that of young people .young people will have a lot of risks to attempt to do everything that they have not meet with , and they will suffer the failure that the world gives to them .when they feel fail they will rely on the older people to help or to share the experience that the young people have not .and the older people enjoy the quiet and idely life in the world .they can do everything calmly and happly , they will happy to teach the young people the proper ways that live in the world .they have so many nice memories that happened in their past life , even meeting with failure , they will become more wiser and sophysicated .secondly , old people have little stress from the society .in the advancing technology society , with the advent of new technology and discovery , young people feel the great stress in the society , they must advance their knowledgy and technology level to fit with the fast pace of the society .they should work hard to make money and not be dropped out by the peers in the intense competition .however , the older people have no stress , also they will benefit from the advanced society .because they have accomplished the task and have more time to share the achivement they made in their young times .they can do fishing and travele by airport not just spend more time on train as past , they will communicate with their friends on internet , not must to write a letter that will arrive at their friends after a few days .they will have the happiness to teach their granddaughters .of course , the young people has so many enjoyment in this world .their curiousity make them to discover new things .it is so wonderful to taste the different foods in differend country and feel the different culture in other countries far away from the country they live in .they have the energy to climb the mountains that abundant their adventure experience in their lives .they have so many chance to see the change of the world .in summary , older people will enjoy the wonderful world in their ways , and young people will also find so many interesting things continuesely in the world .
