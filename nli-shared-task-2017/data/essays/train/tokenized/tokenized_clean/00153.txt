i do disagree with the idea according to which young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their own communities .i would rather think that nowadays young people do a lot of efforts to try to help and solve social problems in order to improve and join their own communities .though young people are usually considered as lazy and selfish and without any particular interest towards social or cultural problems , i do not think that they actually are .let is consider , for instance , the case of young volounteers .they are widespread as you can find them everywhere , in every country .it does not matter which specific field they are interested in , it is just important that they are engaged in something they believe in .any little help given by young people helps the society to improve itself .in addition , any single minute they spend for the communities is meanfull .in my particular experience i was used to be a social volounteers for nearly ten years , first in a community of down children , and then as a phone listener in an association called ( telefono amico ) : it is clearly a lot of time .thus , in my opinion and in my experience , i think that it is not that true that young people do not give enough time to helping their own communities .they actually can do , and they do , that .
