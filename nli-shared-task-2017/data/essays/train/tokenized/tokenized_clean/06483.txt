young people contribute themselves in helping out the communities .though these people have a very much little time to spend on these communities , they do more .they stated few programes like collecting funds to orphanages and old age homes .they move from one organisation to other organisatoin , from one individual to other individual to collect the funds .the future politics is also in the hands of these young people .much to be changed in the feild of politics , especially in the country like india , where the political people are not so beneficial to the society .every young man is ofcourse not helpful has they have their own problems .they have to attend the classes fulltime and he gets frustrated , while some are employed etc .but , somehow these people should find out minimum time to help thie societies .ten out of hundred in india are still illterates and unemployed .one among us should find the source to eradicate these conditions .due to other bad conditions availing is the influence of narcotics i.e drugs .many young people are been addicted to the drugs , where they are not in a condition to maintain themselves .by the influence of these drugs , youth is disturbed .besides drugs , even cinemas , telivision sets also disturb the young people .everyone should get awarenes on the influence of these drugs and media .besides all these things , youth get themselves in active participation for helping out the communities .the most prevailing problem now a days is aids , these awareness programes are actively done by the young people .
