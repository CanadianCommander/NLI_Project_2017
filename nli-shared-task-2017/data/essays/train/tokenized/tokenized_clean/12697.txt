life is unique and is all what we have .there are different kinds of people experiencing different stages of life .obviously the two major kinds of people are the younger and the older .what everyone wish to do is to enjoy their life and i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life when compared to the old .first , younger people have very less responsibilties in their life when you compare to that of a older guy .a old man usually keep thinking about his family and his responsibilities .he got to sacrifice many of his pleasures for the sake of his duties .on the other hand most of the young guys main aim would be to enjoy the life whether its college or job as they got someone who cares for them .second , not all things are possible for a older guy as he doesnot have the energy or capability .energy is innate in an younger one .considering an example in which both the younger and older goes on an expedition probably a mountain .the later could not do it alone as he does not have the potence in him .although he might have a good knowledge about the place , he is not physically suitable .finally there scope of enjoyment for the older is narrowed .the narrowing is due to society and physical capability .normally a oldman can not go around adventorous trips or play different kind of games especially outdoors .society brings a lot of change in the older people especiallty their thoughts , their character and their behaviour .for example , he can not flirt around with a girl as he had a wife , he can not go on a risky job as he got many people dependent on him .coming to the younger people the scope is as broad as their imagination .they can enjoy thier life in the way they wish to .i hereby conclude confidently that young people do enjoy life mre than the older people do .
