there are some people who think making products seem much better in the advertisements is better , but others prefer to let the product looks like what they really are in the advertisements .however , i would have to say that , if i were faced with this issue , i would probably disagree to let the products seem much better in the advertisements .in the following discussion , i would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint .no issue is more important than the one that to let people know what they really want to buy .if all the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , how can we buy what we want ?we have to go to the place where sells the product and then figure out what it actual is .in this case , the advertisement will lose its importance .do nt you think the example quoted above are very pursuasive ?the advertisements will become less important that is another head and chief reason that i have chosen to put here .people will become to figure out the product by themselves instead of trusting the advertisements .it is no better illustration that can demonstrate the view .if you can see that , you can understand it more deeply .superior as making products seem much better is , either make products seem much better or let the products maintain the original situation has its own demerits .to sum up , the reasons discussed above which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more pursuasive .as a result , we can safely reach the conclusion that the advertisements should nt make products seem much better than they really are .not only do i prefer to make products seem what they are , but also i prefer that the advertisements should use a proper way to make the products seem better .
