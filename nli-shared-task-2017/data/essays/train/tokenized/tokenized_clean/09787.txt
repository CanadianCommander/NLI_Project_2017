in many different ways of the transportation , i think using cars are the most comfortable one in our daily lives .although there are newer technological ways of transportation such as metro and plane ( preferable especialy for long distances ) , car usage will never decline in future years for several reasons .firstly , travelling with your car is different than most of the other transportation ways as you may travel alone in it .but when you choose a bus or a metro or a plane you have to travel with other people whom you do nt know and whom you may not want to be together .secondaly , using cars gives you more freedom as you do nt have to catch up with scheduled times of other transportation ways .you may plan your travel or vacation as you like , you may stop whenever and wherever you want and do nt have to worry about the restrictions of bus stop points for example .thirdly , although some people may argue that fuel stocks will be diminished and therefore there will be fewer cars in use , new technological inventions will always find a solution .there are some studies such as cars working with solar energy .such kind of inventions will solve the giant need of fuel for cars and they will be in use also in future .perhaps , their appereance and thechnology will be different then now as a result of constant improves in technology .finally , as cars are different than other transportation ways , in their comfort and freedom , they will always be used in the future as much as they used now untill there will be an invention of a new transportation machine as speed as and as comfortable as cars .
