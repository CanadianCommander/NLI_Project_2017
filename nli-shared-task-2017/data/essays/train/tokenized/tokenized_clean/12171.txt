the question of this essay asks for an opinion of whether or not the number of cars will be decreased in twenty years .many people have been using cars for the last several years and cars are still in use today .my opinion is that although this is true , people will not be using cars as much as they use them today in twenty years .to begin with , one reason that i think there wo nt be many cars used in the future is the connection to environmental problems .the air have been already polluted because of so many cars that have been used , among other pollution problems such as smoke coming from factories .the polluted air could eventually lead to global warming in the next twenty years .scientists are aware nowdays that the tide of the ocean is rising every year .if people were to use more cars in the near future , this will probably cause an effect on global warming .scientists will probably try to convince the government to inform nations to decrease their use of cars .another reason that i think there will be fewer cars in the future is that people are already risking their health by using cars more often that instead of using trains or buses for transportation .every year , countries , especially in the united states , are suffering from car accidents .although adults have been have been suffering from drunk driving , ( when they drive their cars when their drunk ) , teenagers have also been having the same problem .the united states especially had been having hundreds of teenagers dying from car accidents when they were drunk .although the rate of driving cars while drunk are beginning to decline , hopefully the goverment of the us and of other countries will ban the law of drinking and driving .in conclusion , i believe that the use of cars will probably decrease in twenty years because the goverment will try to establish laws due to pollution , health and accident risks .hopefully the world will improve to be a better place by using less cars .
