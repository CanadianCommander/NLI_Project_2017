there are certain areas that differs from each other according to how a student studying in those areas should respond to the needs of the area he or she studying in . .although some of them such as mathematics require a student to learn facts , understanding ideas and concepts about an area or an issue is more important .one of the reasons that can be given to the statement that understanding is more important than learning facts is ability to apply what a student learn practically .for example , i am studying pyscoholgy and it is not enough for me just to learn the facts about certain things .as i want to be a pyscologist in the future i need to apply what i learn and i need to solve my patient s problems .this certtainly requires to understand ideas and concepts of what i study .the other reason is that a person can be more creative and do well on their exams when she understand the ideas and concepts .rather than accepting the fact after learning it , students can discuss the concepts and even improve the ideas that they understant .in my department i have a frind whose conception of studying is totaly different from me .while i always try to learn the main facts and concentrate on them , she focuses on concepts and just tries to understantds ideas .what i observed recently is she is doing better than me in exams and this lead me to become a conclusion that since i only focus on learning facts , it makes me limited to them and i can not answer or respond to anything practically .what is more is she is more creative than me in producing solutions to practical problems of some patients that we study as an exercise in a hospital .to conclude , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .that is the way i want to change myself towards also .
