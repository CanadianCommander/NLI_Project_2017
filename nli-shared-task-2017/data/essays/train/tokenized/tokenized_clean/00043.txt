i agree that .in my case , i agree .there are few reasons .first of all , having a lot of knowledge makes me live easily and useful .for example , when i see a tv news program , i can understand almost of every issues and have my own opinions against them .secondly , having a plently of broad knowledge means having a lot of topics to talk about .for example , when i go to a party , i have to talk to a person who i do nt know .at the time , we should talk something .if i know a lot of topics , making a conversation is easily .when we first meet a person , we do nt talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meetings .ofcourse , a person who mastered a specific subject can help many person or things .for example , doctors , lowers , scientists , etc .however , i am not the kind of person .my way is that ask a specialist when i do nt know .so , they are .conclude , i agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject .
