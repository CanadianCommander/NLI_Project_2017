i do agree with the statement that , `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the possibility of author statement being right in some situations and untrue in others renders the statemant deabatable .i would like to highlight severals examples in support of my position and on my way .firstly , on the looking at the the statement in twenty yers ther - e will be fewer cars in use than there are now presently might look quite convincing but on a closer scrutine the statement is unacceptable and downright erronous .for example , when we consider traffic problems and other problems which lead to blockling of roads the statement is acceptable as it stands .secondly , by considering on the number of people and the area to park the vechicles whic , h creates lot many problems the statement is acceptable .but when we consider the commucating point of u view , cars are required for almost every individual and which makes he or she to communicate easily .on this condition the statement is unacceptable .thirdly , by considering this the manufacturing point of view , in which more and more number of cars are manufactured and since there is demand in cars they manufacture them and it never ends but with little updates in model of the cars .since in the demand point of view also u ca nt agree with the statement that cars decrese day by day .finally , when considering environment point of view , the government may put rules that only whose financial position is good enough only has to buy cars if so then the statement can be accepted .but i think it do nt really work .in my point of view , i oppose the statement that cars decrease day by day and i also stateted many examples to support my ideas and my own opinion and also in more twenty years it doubles .neverthless , on a detailed analysis reveals that the statement is unacceptable and even indefensible also .in sum , the issue in quesion is entirely debitable and therfore a balanced view must be arrived at by thorough analysis .
