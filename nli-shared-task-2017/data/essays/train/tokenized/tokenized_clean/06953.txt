it is of course crucial that students understand first of all ideas and concepts ; one can not build a genuine knowledge of literature for example , if one does not understand notions like romanticism , modernism , post-modernism , etc . ..these notions are a great help to understand and define similarities between writers ( or their differences ) , and it allows the student to categorize them , and to see if these categories really fit them or if they can be challenged .the purpose of these big concepts is to create categories , types , which provide landmarks for the student .if we think of history , it is impossible to understand the history of the xxth century without being able to define and understand major concepts such as facism , communism , capitalism , or feminism , since all these concepts are significant of a certain era , and of certain ways of thinking .however , understanding concepts and ideas is useless if the student is unable to relate them to actual facts ; indeed , it is difficult to write an essay on the evolution of the feminist movement in a given time period if the only thing the student remembers is the definition of feminism .one needs facts to support one s point , and what is more , the student will not be able to handle the notions easily if he has no actual facts to relate them to , and to clarify his or her point .facts are often very useful to understand better the concepts , and they also allow us to illustrate our point .in this perspective , a teacher will rely on facts to illustrate or prove his or her point ; it is easier to convey the meaning of a given concept through an illustration , and it is also easier to remember for the student , especially if the example given is shocking , or amusing .a mere knowledge of the general concepts and ideas would be too restrictive , and would result in a superficial knowledge , which is not very useful in the end .on the other hand , a good mastery of both concepts and facts will allow the student to have in-depth knowledge , which is the most important .in that sense , it is impossible to focus only on the general ideas and to leave out the facts .
