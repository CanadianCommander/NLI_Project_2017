the topic discuss about the less time that the young people have to halping their communities .i think that the young people have a lot of time for helping their communities but they do nt want help it .for example , i go to help a lot of young students to study and to learnt every weeks .i study at the university and play guitar in a rock band but i have more time to helping my communities .the young people nowadays think only about to theirself .in my opinion , we need to educated all people to give their time to their communities but this way is not simple because today all people think that is better stay at thieir home to play a playstation than help who have a problem .on the other hand , life is more difficult and quikly than 100 years ago and the young people do nt go to the community because they go in the city to study and when they return at home they are more tired .in addittion the country do nt have a good place for education and for meet other people .in conclusion , i think that the government need to gives places and he need to does an activity in the schooltime for increase in the young people the want to helping the other people with their ability and possibility .
