during my life i made many social work to support my community .i think that i can disagree with the statement : `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  because i m a young person and i do its .but i kown that this statement is truth in many communities and in many group of young people .infact many young people do nt make nothing to help or to support their communitie .this situation is because they do nt feel part of their communities .for example if a young person changes his home many times he ca nt feel a part of a community and i understand that is difficul to help some unknown thing .also because if you do nt know a thing you ca nt imaginate of what this thing need .sometime young people are criticated by their communities and so it very difficult that young people want help them .sometime young people have really too many things to do .for example school , sport , work . ..and they have no time for social attivities .i think that is very important for a young person make some thing for his community because in this way he can feel able to help some one .
