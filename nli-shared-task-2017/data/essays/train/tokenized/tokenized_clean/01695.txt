i m from a coutry in which history is more than millenary , and it is absolutely true and right that s always useful and needed to learn from the past to look up to the future , but in my personal life and experience i ve always found that the fact itself ca nt stick permanently in to our memory ( but this may be because i m not a huge fan of history too ! ) , more often it s the exact contrary , we kind of filter what the fact was trough our senses and what most has captured our attention on the matter .if nothing has captured our attention it s more than probable that we wo nt remember it for as much time as needed for the growth of a critical mind .i ve often been in the situation of having to choose between formation and information ( where for information i mean thetwo or three pointers that can help me in a short time , but wo nt leave me nothing for the future ) .well , i ve attended classical studies in high school and one of my professors , who has been a real menthor for most of our class , used to say that school has the primary objective to form people , not to inform them , and it can be done only by giving the instruments and possibility to approach a new fact with a proper critical sense .in other words the students deserve to think with their own minds , preferably open minds .it has to be assured to them the possibility to dig under the fact , understand it s logic , by analyzing it from different points of view , discuss it , in a certain sense make it of proper own , infer the essential contents andthen desume a lesson for the future .all in all if we want people thinking with their own minds we have to give them the right instruments and focuses , so it s way better to understand t
