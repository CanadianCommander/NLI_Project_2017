young and elder people have different ways of enjoying life .in fact , some enterainment are specific to your age .for instance , sports well illustrates that difference between generations .so , with respects to those differences , do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?according to me , young people enjoy life more tha older people do .first , i think that contrary to older people , young people do not have any physical limit .they can enjoy life in any conditions , compare with older people , young people do not have any limitations considering their activity .they can play any sport , they can run .when you are young , your body is still a place to discover and to grow playing sport or doing any physical activity .on the contrary , for many older persons , any activity needs a long preparation , for instance shopping or even just walking .so i think that in those conditions , young people enjoy life more than older people do .second , when you are young , you know nothing , you are curious .it means that during your youthness , life is an extraordinary place to discover through relationships , knowledges , travels , cultures , etc .everything is new for you : people , love countries , language .though , when you are young , you can not be messed up .each experience is a new one .on the contrary , i think that when you are older , life is hardly a daily surprise and , by the way , easily becomes a routine .it s harder to meet new people , traveling becomes difficult .so , that is to say , that young people have to take advantage of their youthness .according to me , we are young only once in our entire life that is why young people do have to enjoy their life more than older people have alrea
