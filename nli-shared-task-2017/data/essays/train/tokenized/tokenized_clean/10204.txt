in contemporary society , specialization in one specific subject tends to be the most common thing .some people spend all of their lives studying a particular year of the life of a king , or some kind of abstract things related to an unknown topic of algebraic topology .this kind of people tend to extremely focus their point of view on a single topic , and to examinate it in every side .i think that such an approach to an academic subject is a bit limitating .in my opinion , one should have a broad knowledge of many academic topics , rather than fossilize himself on a single point of a matter .first of all , i think that everyone should have a personal amount of knowledge , and be prepared at least on the basic things .everyone should know , for example , that the earth orbits the sun and not viceversa !!some people , instead , may know everything about the poetry in south italy between 1900 and 1910 , but ignoring at all such a basic thing .this is rather an extreme example , but it is what happens in practice .another point pro having a broad knowledge of many subjects is the fact that there are many things that diserve to be studied .the world and human history are so rich in beautiful things , that i think it is a crime to not take them in consideration .an objection to what i am saying could be made : such a way to proceed , that is to fly from a flower to another like a bee , could lead to nowhere .acting this way would bring nothing more to society .no improvements can be reach .my opinion is that to invent something new , it is necessary to grasp relationships between things .for example , it is the contrast between classical mechanics and electromagnetism that lead to the theory of relativity .no one would have though to relativity if thinking to classical mechanics or electromagnetism separately .for this reason , i think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .
