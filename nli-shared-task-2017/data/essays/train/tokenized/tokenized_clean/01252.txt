nowadays , most of the people are looking for a very secure and non-stressful life whereas , in the same time , most of their dreams are made of success , money and interesting experiences .this is paradoxal as the behavior which consists to not be afraid of taking risks and trying new things is a must have in order to reach such goals .this statement can be supported by pointing out how innovative people create their own success yet also by analyzing the risk theory in a financial view and realizing that we need to look ahead and not behind to create our futur .by paying attention to the current most succesful businessmen such as bill gates or the creators of google , we can firstly learn that innovation is a major key of success .in fact , a person who has no fear to try new things , to take risk or just to think about something different or bizarre for most of the people will be more able to create a new need for customer .for instance , the compagny sony in the 90s bet on producing walkmans , which are portable music maker , and by this new product created a new market without any competitors .such a great innovation sharply increased sony s benefits during several years .if we talk about risk on a financial view , we will notice that , furthermore , according the risk theroy , for every investment there is a level of risk implied .so , if a compagny wants to develop its profits , this one must undergo risks .in other words , the riskier is an investment , the more lucrative it will be .this financial theory , which deals about shares and bonds , can be extended to other field such as education , self improvment , sport etc .all in all , im my opinion , we can pretend to be success
