i agree with the statement as i think there have occured various societal changes during the last decades which have influenced the attitude towards community-help in general and especially for young people .in my point of view an essential step is taken in the early childhood .influenced by the fact that more and more parents are working , even mothers return to work earlier than years ago , children have to occupy themselves also in young age .for sure , children choose activities which occur attractive and interesting for them .this point leads to a further factor which influences the decrease in community-help of young people .the new information technology , for instance internet , computer-games , ...appears more attractive and challenging to young people compared to community-help .also influenced by the fact that mostly both parents are working , they do not have time to help in communities .consequently children do not have anybody to look up and follow .further i believe that young people do not want to spend too much time for activities in communities , as they are much more interested in a variation of different things and want to explore the world and its diversity .this is supported by national and internation policy which is presenting attractively the advantages of going abroad , make self-experiences in other countries and cultures , learning foreign-languages while staying in a country where this language is spoken , and so on .further thinking on my own experience in my home country , universities and colleges are more and more centralised .therefore young people have to leave their home-village pretty soon after finishing highschool if they want to attend higher education .consequently people are at least locally separated from their communities .to sum up , i regret that community-help is decreasing , however i can see reasons leading to this development .and deep in my heard i hope that young people reflect on this development and put more emphasize on communtiy-help in future .
