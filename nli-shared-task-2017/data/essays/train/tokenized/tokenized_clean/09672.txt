i do not agree with the statement .the reasons are three which are written below .first reason of disagreement is not to be able to choose places where i visit .places where we want to visit might be different by each person .however , we have to dicide one place if we are led by a tour guide and travel as a group .in addition , a tour guide explain about someting i am not interested in at all .i want to travel wherever i want and i want know that i really interested in .i can ask to people who are familiar with the places instead of a tour guide .second reason is responsibility .in a group we have reasponsibility as a group member .we can not do something selfish and have to follow a tour guide .however i can go aroud freely if i travel by my self .the responsibility is only for me .when i went to washington d.c. , i wanted to visit some ghetto places .we should go out in a group .however i can not take responsibility for my friends if my friends and i go some ghetto places and bad things happen .therefore i went around by myself .third reason is about time .when we travel in a group led by tour guide , our travel will be scheduled like `` 6:00 p.m. visit musium  or  9:00 p.m. eat dinner .however , how much time we want spend will change by each person .because of those three reasons which are choosing places , responsibility and time .the idea of statemant is not confortable for me and i do not agree with the statement .
