when it comes to travel , travel itself is not to pass by some places or roads , but to pass the memory of past and to broaden each person s sight , which is different from one another .thus i disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide .travel with a certain tour guide could make people informed about the facts of touring places .but it never makes people appreciate their real values as much as touring by oneself or with a group of two or three .i have once made a trip to seattle , canada .there were about 100 people in my company and several tour guides .in addition to the gloomy and murky weather there , what it made me frustrating , there were some restrictions that we , 100 people , should nt do such as going outside hotels and shopping .i knew how much trouble it would cause if one person were missing .out of all exciting and curious feeling , it did nt make sense to me that we care and count the number of people missing if any .so after coming back from the trip , i had not much memory with seattle .all memories about tour guides incessantly infinite information without moving around freely came up on my head everyday for quite few days .in contrast to the trip to canada , only with my sole body and my friends , i have gone to california from texas where i was living then .on the way to go to my destination , los angeles , we dropped by las vegas .everywhere i could meander was enough to inspire my sense of appreciation .although i did nt come to learn any information about travel place in detail , i was content with even small matter that i learned by looking , walking , and asking if i had any questions .after that trip to california , i could not help but thinking about the fun memory and wholesome information i myself had asked ( so never forget ) .moreover i was so thankful for the time and nature , for very little thing .i felt i enjoyed so much that i wanted to go again .there is distinct different thing between traveling in group with tour guide and traveling in person without tour guide .if i had made a trip twice with exact same course consecutively with a group and tour guide , it would have been boring and pointless .the realing meaning of travel in my opinion is when i have refreshness every time differently even at the same route .and the real tour guide is in oneself who is capable of seeking for the joy of the travel .
