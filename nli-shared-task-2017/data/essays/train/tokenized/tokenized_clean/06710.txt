i agree with this statement .understanding ideas and concepts is more significant than learnig facts because undertanding ideas and concepts affect on the skill of remembering and explaining things , and it also helps to learn other information .understanding ideas and concepts means that understanding things deeply .if you understand details of thing which you want to remember , you do nt forget it easily .also , you can explain about it when you are asked some one about it .if you learn only fact , it is good for remembering for short time to answer tomorrow s quize , but you may not be able to remember it for long time .you ca nt also explain about it deeply in the class .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning just facts for studernts .another reason why understanding details is more important than learning facts is that it affects on learnig new things .if you perceive details of thing which you learn perfectly , you can understand things which you will learn next easily .most of the things which student learn in school such as math , chemistry , phsyics or english tend to relate to each other .when you learn new things , new things are came from old things which you have already learned .therefore , if you understand ideas and concepts deeply , you can understand new things easily .in conclusion , understanding details deeply helps to remember and explain things which you learned and to learn new knowledge easily .for all these reasons , understanding ideas and cocepts is more important than learning facts for students .
