nowadays there are so many cars throughout the world .and people can see so many cars when they walk on the street and it may find limited place for car park .in my opinion , i agree with that in twenty years it will be fewer cars is use than today .first of all , generally speaking , people who drives car are make many pollution such as air pollution , soulnd pollution and so on .these pollution may affect people s health and even get some serious diseases .in additional , everyday on the highway there are so many cars in the morning and those drivers who are rush and want to keep time so they always overspeed and then may make accident .if there can make less cars thus it is not only prvent the traffic jam , but also few accidents in a day .however , sometimes it s much easier than we act .if people want to make less car-user and make sure it really work ; here i provide some recommendations that may handle these problems .one of the solution is that people can people should use less by driving car and they can use some other public vehicle to replace to drive car .for example , mrt , bus etc .this will reduce lots of air pollution and it can be provide more car-park space for other driver and it can prevent people are polluted by the cars .another solution is that the governemnt can also help people to perform this activity use different ways such as make a new policy that limite people only can buy one car for every household and increase the tax of the care and licience per year .therefore , it will make less number of cars and people and people who do not purchase too much cars to spend the extra land for car-park .overall , there is lots of cars around the world and people should make use less of car .therefore over twenty years it can prvent air and sound pollution , traffic jam and even accidents .
