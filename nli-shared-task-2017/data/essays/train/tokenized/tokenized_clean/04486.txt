in the modern world we are able to sell goods which are producted in europe all round the world .to let our potential customers know about our goods or services we need to ad them .thanks to the modern mass media : tv , internet and the press , we can ad our products everywhere .ads could be pictures or tv clips or internet banners where we can explain which are the uses of our product , what customers can do by it and how their life will be improved using that product .so we use the ads to pesuade people to buy our products for its characteristics or peculiarities .someone said that `` the advertisement is the soul of the commerce  , no sentence has been so true like that .often , for this reason , who makes ads tries to give to the product more than it has really got .in this sense i agree with this statement because very often this people tries to persuade us with false adjectives , false implicit meaning trying to force us to buy that product .producers of ads often can persuade people to buy their product , but i think that , if the product is nt like the ad on tv , people will be very disappointed with it and they will talk to other people explaining what happened .in this situation the company which ads will lose his possibility to sell anymore his products .anyway i think that we need an international authority which checks all the ads trying to delete lies and what can illegally persuade people to buy that product .we need a code of advertisement and who makes ads must respect those laws and he should be clear with the potential customers .i know is difficult to create an international authority , especially in those countries where also the market is without specific laws that can regulate it .but i think that if all the developed countries join the efforts , some improvements could be done .
