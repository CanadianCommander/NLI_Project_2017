i agree with the statement that mentioned above .for example a bussiness man should attempt new markets or develop new strategies in addition to their rational states .because envirement always changes with it s advantages and threats .so if a bussines man wants to survive and gain more benefits than the others has to differ hisself with their risks .everybody knows investing is a critical case .if you really do not know the rules or other parameters in the market that you attempt to exist , you will lose your money .it is clear that it contains risks because you are a new character in the market .you could be beaten by your competitors .the information and skills is a key point to accomplish the new situations risks and threat .you shoul have skills and information , lack of information could sink you .but if you have information , and qualify enough with the state of brave you could benefit and defend yourself from the threats of the market or somoething else .surely seeing the future is an ability but you can estimate the future conditions with the today s informations and trends .you can be the best at what you are doing at , but if you do not improve yourself to an advanced level , you will see somebody has already done .and has already benefiting that you could be did if you had not been a lazy one .a sweedish king said ` i would be at a position of winnig with the help of the lossings that i had  .this life i think not for the people who does not improve himself or has a lack of brave emotion , there will be always risks but we all have to try to accopmlish , and let to lead ourselves to advanced levels .
