i agree with that the most adevertisements make procucts seem better than they really are .i have two reasons .first , the informations on the products are different from the real contents .for exeample , i often use cataloge shopping to buy my clothes .at that time , the clothes sended from company are totally deffrent the pictures .the size , color seconds , the advertisements do not send real messages .for instance , the rabel of foods says only main materals .the advertisements need our life so , it have to send real information or massage .
