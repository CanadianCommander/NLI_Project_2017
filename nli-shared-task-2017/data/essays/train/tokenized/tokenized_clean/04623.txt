many people consider that it is better to specialize in one specific subject , but in my openion , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better .there are three reasons to support my statement .people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make subject more interesting , broaden their horizon , and have many different perspectives to watch the world .although some people think that spcialize in one subject will make themself more professional .however , if they do not pay much time on their study , or think the subject is so boring , they still can not make themself professional .hence , study in many kind of academic subjects will make people feel more interesting , once they enjoy what they read , then they will real understand what the book said , people still can become professional .next , major in broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects can broaden horizon .for example , if people just major in one subject , they only know the field , but if they study in many subjects , they may know history , the foreign language or learn hot to appreciate the fine art , they will not limited what they study .`` enjoy what i learn , then i will become excellent .if people interest in t many kinds of subjects , that will broaden their vision , and it could make people to have different respects to watch the wonderful world .they may have positive thinking than those people specialize in one specific subject , bucause people have broad knowledge may also have positive mind .
