helping communities is one of the most important thinks that can improve a state .as a matter of fact some years ago people spent more of their time in helping the others .although nowadays people , and expecially young guys , are not used to spend free time for their own buisness rather than giving a social contribution .in my opinion this behavior is not useful , because if all people go on thinking only about their owns , so many problems are going to increase .i can give you an example to make you better understand my state .first of all i would like to speak about the poors .these people have a lot of problems that are linked with their economic health .worldwide there are people that prefer to spent their time in increasing their amount of money and in general their beneath , instead of investing some of their huge amount of money in the communities .if all of the richest people in the world would invest some resources in helping others , i m sure that everyone could be happier , also the richest ones .in fact one of the most important things that this kind of people can not understant is the emotion and the sensation that they could feel when they help someone .when people help someone else the benefits are not only for the poors or the receivers of the help but also for whom has given the help .in conclusion i want to say that people , and in particular young people , would learn again that give is the best thought that someone can have .if young people would improve the way to give help to the others i m sure that all of us could have a lot of benefits not only in the closed future but also in the far future .in fact in this way people that now are guys will be able to teach this concept to the offspring and go on .all the world would be better than it appeares now .
