i do nt think that it s important for students to understand ideas and concepts as compared to learn facts .i think ideas and concepts help the students in learning in their intial classes only .in my opinion , the facts are more important to learn as they are used in long run .for example , i was a student of the physics class .as part of our course structure we have numerous derivations to understand the idea behind a particular fact .at that time i used to cram all the derivations in order to get good marks .but now at this point of my age i can just able to remember what was the fact not the idea or the concept behind it .like i remember that what is the density of water but i do nt know how to calculate it .so , i belive that students should more concentrate on facts than understanding ides and concepts .
