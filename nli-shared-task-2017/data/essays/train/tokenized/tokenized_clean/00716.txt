during the first reading of this task i have already made my choice .i personally disagree with that statement .why ?i have experienced that many people in may surrounding spend much time in helping their / my community .let me give you an example .i know many people who give evening - courses for pupils in their age for being better in school and that for free !another quit good example is the group of some pupils who meet older people / seniors during christmas-time for giving some hope and the feeling of being part of the society and i personally think that this is a great supportment for the whole community in a city .there are also some young people in my surrounding who created an anti-drug club for preventing youngsters and also older people from taking drugs and / or commiting crime .i do not want to show that topic onesided , i mean i clearly know some people who have not taken part in a free social programm instead they prefer watching tv , playing computergames the whole envening or night , disturbing other people , stealing or destroying things but i think the majority of the youngsters i know are really motivated in doing things for the community , just because of fun and avoiding to be bored by a situation .i know in other societies ( china ) pupils have to work for their family and others instead of wasting the time because it is traditional .but relating to the statement , what is enough time to help the community ?i think it is quit enough when someone also do only a half hour or less every day for the community .so it is clear that it is up to everyone to do what he wants to do but i think everyone has also the task to show respect for the community itself and for what they do for every part of the society you live in .
