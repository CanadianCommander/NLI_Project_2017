i agree with the statement `` sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is a well known proverb `` no risk no gain  .when someone thinks about some idea or plan that is not common , he works diligently over it and tries to accomplish his dreams .all the scientific invention are based on this idea .if the scientists follow only the traditional patterns then there will be no new invention and our society would nt have been as developed as it is today .right brother thought of a flying vehicle and this was not a conventional idea that time but they followed their instincts and worked hard for it and invented aeroplane .and today we all know them for this accomplishment and it contributed a lot to our civilazation .taking risks at time worth as the end results are more beneficial and pathbreaking .if we do not try new thing our life becomes boring and less challenging .it is a well known fact that in business , at times some great business man as mr. henery ford created a new vision and inplementes it successfully .if he had nt taken the risk we would nt known him as a leading businessman .it is a fact that we all want to do things that we know well rather than trying something new as it envolves less risk and the chances of failure are reduced but to achieve something extraordinary we are required to take chances in our life .as an ordinary approach towards life will yeild only an ordinary result .there will not be any opportunity to achieve something that is not streotype .all the achievers in the history are known for their adventurous spirit instead of taking the safe side and sticking to their regular job .i can personally state this because my brother who did his enguineering , instead of doing a regular job opted to study further in a world known university .for this he took a loan from the bank and taken a big risk but today he is successfully working as an interbnational aeronatical expert and repaid all the sum .his sucess taught me to dream big and work hard to achieve it .conclusively i stongly support this policy of taking risks and gaining more friutful results .
