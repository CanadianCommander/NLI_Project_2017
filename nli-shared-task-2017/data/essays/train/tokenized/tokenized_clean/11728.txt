in these days , advertisements are really important part for the companies .people who make ideas for advertisement always try to find creative and impressive ideas .in my view , it ca nt be avoid for the companies to make products seem much better than they really are in their advertisements .there are so many advertisements in the word and the companies want that people are interested in their products .besides , to make interesting advertisements , they have to show only good points of their products instead of short points .first , most advertisements are made to grab people s eyes .for example , we can see so many advertisements for cell phones on tv .whatever , they are all just cell phones which help our communication with more conveniences .but every cell phone company makes their own advertisements differently with others , because it need to grab people s eyes .and it will be connected right away with their selling .also , the advertisements have to show only good points to people instead of short points .we do nt have any those kinds of rule .but , there are no more silly things than showing your products very candidly .if you say to people that my products are really really good but it have some short points , too .then , no body will buy your products , because the short points are looks like bigger than good points for customer .therefore , in customers  view , the companies or sellers are telling a lie to customers or make customers to think the products are better than they really are .accordingly , it s true and it ca nt be avoid for the companies and sellers to make their products seem much better in advertisements .they have to grab at least one more customer in rough advertisement s world .and they have to show only their good points to sell their products .
