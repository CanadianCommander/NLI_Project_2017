there are two ideas about knowledge .one encourages the person to have extensive knowledge of his/her academic subject and the other thinks that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects .the subject should be discussed in terms of the efficency that knowledge would enhance the person to .altough knowledge adds much to a persons general culture , specialization would let scientific truths to be turned on .broad academic knowledge , would give much to a person because of the ability that knowledge provides to think in different ways .when a person gets to inforamation in different subjects , his ability of thinking improves .the reason of this matter is that when a person learns about an academic subject , it is required to learn its logic behind too and the different logic lets the one of thinking in different ways .in this way having a broad knowledge seems more effiecnt for a person .another subject that should be concerned is the general culture that a broad academic knowledge would come with .this would both let the person to have a better social life and also provide him/her to get a knowledge about a veriety of subjects that he/she is interested in .despite the adventages of having a broad knowledhge , specializing on a specific academic subject has an adventage of leting one to know the nearly every information possible .when a person specializes only on one matter , one could lead to new discoveries and improvements on the subject he or she is studying .in this way , specializing in one specific subject would let one to go further to the limits of his/her subject .itlooks better than to have a broad knowledge because one could give something useful to the society by specializing .to sum up , it would be better for individuals to make their own choises to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to speciazlize in one specific subject .if to have a broad knowledge is choosen , that would provide on to have a nicer life full of different knowledge that may lead to different points of view but specializing on one subject would let the person to invent or to discover some improvements .
