in many schools and institutions it is beleived that the importance in learning is by memorizing facts and concepts other than actually understanding them .we are facing two very different types of learning and teaching , and i personally think that the best way is to analize and comprehend .in the older days , teachers left asigments to the students of memorizing and copying facts , dates , names , numbers , among other things .then , the student woul ve passed not even 1 year and he would have forgotten everything the history teacher told him to memorize about the second world war .it would nt have been of any of memorizing in the first place .now , in the other hand , i think that a more modern type of teaching is by making the student analize the problems and understand the answers .for example , in mathematics or physics , instead of the teacher giving the formula to meassure the air , or to find a number , let the student find the formula by himself .in a way , i think this type of teaching helps the student to develop certain abilitys and its esaier for them to solve problems in a far or close future .i think it is very important to actually use the whole porcentage of brain we are capable of using and to think , and figure out our own answers .we are not born with the abilitys we have , but we reforce them , make them stronger .in my personal opinion , it is much more imoportant for us ( students ) to understand and comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn and memorize them .besides , memorizing is always boring .its funner to learn by aplying this type of teaching .thinking is fun .understanding is fun .learning is fun .
