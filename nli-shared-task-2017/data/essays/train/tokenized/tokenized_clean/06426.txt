now , the generation of young pepople is seen like rebel , not nice , bad boy , ...but it s not right for all young children !in the life there are two part : when you are young you do all you want without soucy and when you are an adult it s different , you have a wife , you must work to leave , your parents are died or too old to help you !we will see im the first part it s a good thinif the young children help the communities and in the second part when to participate communitie s life is not a choice but a necessity !when you are young , you have your parents , your family to help you if you have a problem !you have nt got any soucy , you do nt need to earn your money to live , it s your father and your mother who make all !your one problem it s just to be good at school and your parents are happy !you have your friends and you play everytime without conscience of life s problem !it s the beautiful life !but it s not eternel . .....one day you see you are a great boy , simply a man !it s stange because you are father , you have a wife , you work to earn your money because if you do nt work you ca nt live , you know the life what s the problem , what s money , who are your really friend , and you know the justice and all you have to do like you are a citizen !you must help your communities , your city , your country where you live !but all this it s because your parents explained you when you were young all the things you will have to do to be a good citizen and to be accept of other !you did nt invent all this you learnt your power and your homework !in conclusion , i think in the life there is a time for all thing , a time to grow up , a time to learn , and a time to have important responsabilities !it s not a good thing to go to fast and do nt take the time to discover all the life s things !i m agree to say you have to participate to the communities but when you are able to do this and not again when you are a young boy who does nt know anything of life !to finish i m not agree to the young people help the communities when they do nt know anything o life !in some country this young pepople who help the communities are called : slaves !
