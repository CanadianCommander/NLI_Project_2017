in the present day situation , cars are not a `` luxury  item , they re a necessity .every place , whether it be household , or in factories , etc. transportation is incomplete without fourwheelers .looking specifically to cars , or technically `` light motorised , four wheeled vehicle  , one cant really expect there numbers to sink , at least for sure within 20 years .one of the practical reason is that the roads that carry the current capacity of cars , are already there and functional .if the number of cars will reduce , then the traffic levels will go down , and one of the biggest disincentive that prevents a person to buy cars ( the congestion on road ) will also die down .so if the car numbers will go down , it will in itself , motivate people to buy new cars .a nice alternative to using cars is using the subway system , or the railroad , or airways , or bus .but still , one cant make a subway station everywhere in the city , or a run separate trains between every two pair of stations .although for long distances , people might opt for subways or rails , but the `` number of cars  will not decrease , because some time you may need to do extensive shopping , receive your kins from different point in city , move to various locations in the city or out the city where there is no rail connectivity , or no station , the travel plans can change suddenly , with no prior notice .all mass transit systems have a schedule , they arrive and depart in fixed manner , but urgent situations dont .so people might prefer to use mass transport facilities in daily life , the density of traffic may reduce , but the `` number of cars in use  wont decrease .neither can one expect such a huge development in mass transport system to come within 20 years , and continue thereon .one may say that fuel used in cars can get changed .it is said that petroleum reserves will get over within 100 years ( too long !! ) .however , hydrogen powered cells to run cars on electricity is a concept that wont let cars stagnate due to nonavailability of petroleum based fuels .they can be said to be not secure owing to road accidents , but accidents , to point out , is drivers fault and not the vehicle s .also , accidents can happen in any vehicle , but in cars you can have seat belts , air bags and all sort of safety devices not possible in other vehicles .if earning is said to give financial independence , then cars can be said to give transit independence .you need not ask anyone , you need not worry where to go , when to go , how long to stop at any place , and your driving safely confirms the safe transit of other persons in the car .although bike can be an alternative as a transportation medium , but its mainly a 2 seater . ..and no more , and you cant afford to carry various luggage .
