community involvement has always been viewed as an integral and substantial part in the development of young people into mature and responsible people of the society .even today we have academic institutions strongly involving their students to `` give back to the community  through a number of programs .i am in strong view that young people today think of themselves as important members of their community and try to devote time to help out in their own way .more than ever , young people today have been exposed to a large array of problems that their ancestors or even parents never faced .seeing the maginitude of crimes , social and political disturbance , racial and cultural discriminations , environmental problems have made today s children more emphathic to the people and surroundings around them .comming from broken homes in cities falling prey to rising crime rates and poor environmental conditions , these young people have a better understanding of the problems their communities face .me and my friends have been involved in several community projects right from our school days .from helping out at the local library to assisting the rotary club in our city in organising drives for collecting toys and clothes for the lesser priveledged children , we see our work in such projects as a meaningful extension of our lives .today , several young people see their community as one of the most central aspects of their being .from deferring a year before college or graduate school in order to travel and volunteer for social organisations to choosing to work with non profit organisations for their internships , young people are increasingly becomming aware of the ways in which they could help not only their communities but reach out to people across the borders and seas .one very positive aspect that works in the favor of students who actively contribute to their communities is that their work gets highly appreciated by colleges and universities that view them as prospective admits .they see such students as well rounded people with more than just a prestigious degree or job on their mind .there are several trusts that set up scholarships and travel grants for young people who have showed a more compassionate side of their self .this motivates students to set time aside to work with social and environmental groups in their academic instituitions and communities .due to rising competition , it is true that students need to put it long hours to study for exams , write papers , prepare for job interviews and so on .but i believe that by balancing their work with a sense of duty towards the world around them , they could do their part in making a change in their community .this ideology is not only mine but also that of thousands of young people across the globe .
