`` everything was better in former times .i guess all young people know sentences like this from their parents or grandparents in particular with reference to the opinion that young people nowadys do give enough time and energy to supporting the communities they live in .but is this true ?in my essay i will debate , if peolpe spend enough time and enery to helping their community .in particular i will highlight why the help of young people is bitterly needed as well as why also young people would benefit from helping their communties .in my opinion young people , particularly teenager and twens could and shoul help much more in their communities .firstly , i think , nowadays budgets of communities are often almost empty , and as a result , much help is needed .lots of municipalities do not know how to provide services , e.g. for older peolpe - preventing them from isolation - or for children .the only way of providing these social services often is unpaid work of residents .but as far as i know only less young people are interested in providing time and effort to help their communities .they are more interested in having fun , traveling and planing their carrer .e.g. in my hometown almost all people working unpaid for the community are older than 50 .hence , i think the quality of community life would benefit from an increase of engagement of young people .moreover , i think also the personal development of young people would benefit from an increased social engagement .nowadays young peolple - at least in europe - often take anything for granted .they are not aware that we all depend on support and that lots of the things they take for granted cause much work .by doing it on their own they would learn to worship this work .taking all these points into consideration it can be stated that young peolpe increase their engagement for several reasons .bot , the communities as well as themselves would probably benefit from it , however , it will need some time to realise .
