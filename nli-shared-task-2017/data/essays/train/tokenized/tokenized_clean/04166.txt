with the developmemt of the industries all over the world , a though race or competition has begun between companies to sell their products and therefore keep surviving in the industrial environment .for this purpose the companies put a lot on advertisement , most of which shows the product much better than it really is in order to sell it .there are several reaons why a product is perceived much better than it is by the customer .first reason is that when introducing a product , the advertisement mentions only the good and attractive aspects of the product .the consumer purchases it without knowing its  negative sides .for example a product may have many technical properties , which are also presented in the advertisement , however the product may not be durable and in the advertisement it is never mentioned .second point is that many products have some certificates , presented in their advertisement , which do not really account for the quality of the product .a low quality product can even get a cetificate because the requirements for the certificate are only based on the documents that the company presents to the quality assurance comapny .the company is not actually examined for conformance to the stated issues on its report .the advertisements tell that the product is very high quality and shows the certificates it has as a proof .an example for this type of certificate is the iso9000-9001 .this worldwide certificate deals only with the documentation of the quality system in the company and usually fails to account for the actual quality of the product .when consumers see this certificate on the advertisement of the product they take it for granted that the products  quality in convenient .last point is that advertisements usually do not use real examples when introducing a product .for example a person who is advertising a sports device is usually an athlet or even a body builder .however when the consumer watches that advertisement he usually thinks that the man or woman on the advertisement has built those muscles and become fit by that device .another example might be on high fat containing foods .people on the advertisements of these foods are usually slim and the consumer thinks he can also be slim although he consumes that product .to sum up , advertisements generally mislead the consumers about the properties of the product due to several reasons ; they mention only the attractive and good parts of the product , they expose insufficient quality certificates as a proof of quality and they use unreal examples .therefore , consumers should be more careful in buying a product relying on an advertisement .
