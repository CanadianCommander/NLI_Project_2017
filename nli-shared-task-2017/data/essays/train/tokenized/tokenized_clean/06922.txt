one day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who takes the car and goes to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so i disagree that will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years .cars is one of the most important thing that people cant live without , without cars people wont be able to go to work or live their life the way they want .cars is the main thing that is making life easier these days .there are many reasons why number of cars will not decrease for the coming years .one of the most important reason is that cars is the object that help someone go to work and get what the family needs .first of all , people use cars to go work and do their jobs and get everythin that the family needs also it allows them to do many things they like .also one of the most important reasons is that the car helps from moving from place to another .many people needs car for going from their house for example to visit their family .after that cars are made for moving from place to place wheither its far or near .finally , these days number of cars increased because amny students are graduating from schools and they close the age of 18 and they apply for the license to have a car .all people like to drive and mostly teenager .these days who turns to the age of 18 applies for the license test and later on they get a car .in conclusion , i dont think that number of cars will decrease no matter what and through the examples i mentioned cars rate will keep on increasing for the coming days and years .
