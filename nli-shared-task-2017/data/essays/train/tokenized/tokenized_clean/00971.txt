vehicle prefrance in order to travel is usually a problem for the people .people used animals like horses , camels for traveling but with the rapid growth of technology nowadays people are in love with cars .in my oppinion people will reduce the usage of cars in twenty years because the air that we breathe is getting dirtier , the oil that we use in order to get energy for cars is reducing and technology is still improving rapidly so there will be more appropriate vehicles for transportation in the future .first , with the usage of cars the air is getting dirtier day by day , the carbon monoxide , emitted from the turbine of the car , is polluting the air .in some countries like the netherlands governments started to encourage their citizens for using bicycle in order to travel .by riding bikes people , not only will get fit , but also they will breath more clean air .second , and the most important reason for my expectation in reducing car usage , is the oil resources will vanish in the future .more and more people are using cars nowadays but our sources for oil is limited .the oil reserves are becoming less that is why the oil prices are getting higher .in my country some people can not afford buying the oil in these prices .they have cars but they are not able to use them because their financial situation is not well enough to buy oil so often .third , the scientist will find more suitable vechiles in order to travel in the future .in an article i have read , i saw that some researches in the us did find a vehicle which can fly as well as riding on the ground .so with the developing technology some other devices can take the place of the cars in the future .tu sum up , i think less people will still be using the cars in the next two decades .you will think that the cars are safe , econemical and fast but they are also leaving a bunch of carbon monoxide for us to breathe , the oil prices will get higher day by day and the technological improvements will make faster vehicles .so in my opinion people will forget their love towards cars in the future .
