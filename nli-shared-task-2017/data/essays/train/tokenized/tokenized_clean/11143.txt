i agree with the given topic .i think that it better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .i am an engineering student i feel pretty good my subject when i am talking with another engineer .where as it is very difficult to me , to talk about any other subject with other person .recently i went my home town and met my friends .they are all art students .at that time i had to talk about history of world richest culture .they talking well but i could not even talk a single word .at that moment i feel very bad and thought that if u have knowlege about some other topics i definitely able say something .we are living in interdependent society that means we have to help others and take help from others , we must know about our duties and responsebilities and some famous persons .it requires to know about some subjects those are knowlege about history and geography and political sciences and knowledge about some biology .last year summer college a big accedent occur .at that time i and my frined were near by .we do nt immediately what to do , what i mean is to make a phone call to police station .at that time we did nt make .actually it is a our mistake , this is because of lack outer knowledge .in conclusion , every student having broad knowledge of many subjects is better .then only we can easily manage society and studies .
