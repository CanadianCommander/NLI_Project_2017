nowadays there are lots of selections or attractions for young people to spend their leisure time .i agree with this resolusion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .my primary reason is that they are indifferent from their communities .especially where i live , in tokyo japan , young people are not interested in their enviroments .we do not know even our neighbors .it is totally different from the old era in which people used to help each other .in this era , we have the system , what is called , goningumi .it consists of 5 neighbors .this 5 menbers must help each other .for example , at funeral the neibors have to be receptionists and make dishes for comers .this way of thinking to compensate each other still remains in my hometown , but it is definetely decreasing .the communication among people is getting lower and lower obviously .it might be because of the invention of internets .we do not need to communicate neighbors actively .we can buy or enjoy thorough the internet even in case of emergency .the core family is also the evidence for their indeffrence .they like small group .another reason is that the system of society can not allow them to help their communities .i mean that young people have to aquire the up-date skills to catch up with the improvement of the computer .the content and how to use new software is developing day by day .then they tend to consentrate on studying at home , and consuquently they do not have enough time to help their communities even if they are willing to .for these reasons , i agree that young people nowadays don not give enough time to helping their communities .this might be because of us .we had better encourage them to devote our community more .
