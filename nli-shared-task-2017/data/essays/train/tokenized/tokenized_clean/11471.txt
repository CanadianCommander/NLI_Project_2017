you ca nt say its better or bad .if you are a worker in a factory you do not need much academic knowledge .but when you are a teacher on a public school it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjekts , because the pupil want to know everything .in some jobs it is essential to specialize in one specific academic subjekt for example a doktor for the heart or for the brain .in our big world with unbelivible much information it is no more possible for one person to know everything like in the past .some academic subjekts are so big that you must specialize in one specific academic subject , for example the space .since the global wide net has been installed it is easy to becomme information about the whole world .when you are a global player it is important for you to decide which information is good for you and which one not .in such cases it would be good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .and then you must give this information to them one who has specialized himself to one academic subject .at all you can say if you are a teacher or a proffesor or a manager it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .but when you are a worker or a specialist it is better to have knowledge about one specific academic subject .at the 16 and the 17 century it was normall to know everything the so called genius-mind had knowed everything , for example ghoethe or schiller are well knowed genius .but in the present it is very heavy to know everything and in the future it would be impossible to know everything .i thing that specialists become more and more important for everybody .
