it is impossible to determine weather younger or older people enjoy life more .youth has wonderfull advantages , inocence , coming of age , naivity .what a wonderfull surprise to see something for the first time , to touch the snow , to fall in love , to meet a goal .to realize life , its potential and beauty at an age when one is still vigourous , perfect and with all those futures ahead .not one future , multiple futures , so many different paths , options and possibilities .a bounty of choices and a healhy body to fullfill them .the option to choose a life , our life , with such few strings attached .to pick up up our things and start againg over and over , to sit down and establish ourselves when ever we want , such are the choices of youth .intoxicating situations abound in our summer yet as fall and winter come around one develops certain joys , odes to the time allready spent .memmories come into play , recolections have a special flavor , those things that we will never do againg and those friends we no longer laugh with .yet no one can take away those songs you ve all ready danced to , age allow us to see our errors and our goals flourish .a successfull buisness can keep us going for many years past the the retirement age , some say its the thing which keeps one alive .while a successfull son can yield beautifull grandaughters , happiness keeps coming yet in different packages .a bittersweet moment when one switches from the driver seat to the passanger seat , from being an actor to being a spectator , from the field to the stands .yet enjoyment is an everyday activity which no one is deprived of , lets just hope we relize this sooner rather than later .
