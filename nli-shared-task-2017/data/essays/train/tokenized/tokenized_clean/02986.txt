in my opinion , succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because of their character , they are succesful .for example , the architects build buildings .aldo rossi is one of the succesful architects .he has a lot of drawnings , industrials design , buildings .in his school years , his teachers didnt like their drawnings and buildings .they made him to draw the way they wanted .if he didnt do the teachers wanting , he didnt graduate from the university .so he give up studying in university .then in his work , his boss wanted him to draw the way his boss wanted .he didnt give up drawning .he has alotof drwanings altenatives about one building .in addition to this one drawning about his design is not enough for him .so you can alotof drawnings about one of the buildings .also he searchs while designing .he always tries alot of alternatives about his design .so he takes risks .for example : his building or his design arent sold or liked by the people .in addition to this other architects disagree with him about the buildings or his design .but to explore new things ( pozitively or negatively ) makes him more successful .by the way this make he is different from the other architects .by trying new things and taking risks help him while other designing .he can easily improve himself and her career .so her designs and products are not similar .in architecture the variety is very important .so aldo rossi is very successful architect .on the other hand , if he only doing what he already knows how to do well , he repeat himself and his career .so aldo rossi isnt known as a succesful archtect in the world .in conclusion , trying new things and taking risks is very important in our career .if we want to be successful , we always do the best that we can .
