i am disagree with this statement , because for me it is the same important .to understand ideas and concepts about a topic is important because you know about that , but if you can not see the facts you only will have your own opinion and you may not see how this things will be carrying to the end .for example if you study biology you can not stayed only reading and understanding concepts because when you finished your career you could not work because you do not how that thing make .insted if you learn for diferents facts you know how you should drive a situation in the moment because you have already seen and practiced .in my career , ingeenering , i have to learn of the facts because all that i made should be experimented and prove so this experiment is a fact .for other hand you can think that the fact are not only the most important so in diferents careers is not a rule have the facts because are more important ideas and concepts , but in some cases this things should have some facts to prove and learn .so in my own experience the two ideas are many important , if you have the first you should have the second idea , the first can not live whitout the second and the second can not live whitout the first .this ideas are a complement each other and i think that the teachers have to carry to the practice this situation .use this two things , the students feels more self-confident about that they know and how can they solve a problem .
