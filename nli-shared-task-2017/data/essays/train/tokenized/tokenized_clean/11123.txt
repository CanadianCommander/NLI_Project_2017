i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because we may create new things to transport .or , we may try to reduce the number of cars for the environment .first , i think we may create new other things to transport .more faster , efficient and economical tool .in the fact , we are already creating some new things for transporting us .high speed train is good example .it is quite expensive to use , but it would be lower because other more high-speeded things to transport will possibly appear .moreover , i think we may try to reduce the number of cars so will be fewer cars , because cars produce many impacts for the environment .they produce carbon dioxide that can break the ozone layer of the earth .the ozone layer is protecting us from strong uv that can heat up the air of the earth .now a days , many people being aware about this .so , in the future , we will be more sensitive for the einvironment .in conclusion , i agree with the statement , because we may create new other method to transport instead of cars and we may try to reduce the number of cars for our environment in the future .
