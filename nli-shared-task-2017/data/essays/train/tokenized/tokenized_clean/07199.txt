think of it if we would have had no internet facility and we would have send this response through a letter .what would have been the turn around time ?its even hard to think of it .its because of few successful people that we are savoring all these facilities .human being is blessed with a mind power not to use it for things he is already aware of , but to try out different things so that he can help others with it .people who try out new and different things are better known in this world compare to the ones who have been amongst the common ones .successful people differ from others in different perspectives like courage , approach and many more .first lets take an example of sachin tendulkar , the youngest player in the history of international cricket .if he would have assumed that a person can only be a part of country team only at adult age .then his name would not have been written in history .with his courage and strength he gained the major place in world .its his different styles of batting that make him stand different from others .otherwise he would have been like other common players .there are many others and few of them are abraham lincoln , mahatma gandhi who were known for their courage and stood against the governing bodies to bring in the change for all .second , think if einstein would not have come up with those innovations .had it been easy for men now to relate different things which are made easy now , with those laws .if he would have stopped because of his continuous failures and would not have taken another risk then people would have been deprived of another innovation .its the approach and abilty to take risks that counts the most in this world and makes one successful and distinguish person .how many know us ?well very few untill and unless we come up with few distinguish ideas or achievements that make us stand different from others .this is the reason why the researchers or specialists are given high positions in the society .its not becuase they have different degrees attached to their names , its because of the innovations and their capability to try out new and different things .
