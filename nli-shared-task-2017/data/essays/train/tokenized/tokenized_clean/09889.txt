nowadays the competetion for academic success has increased a lot over the last decade .the youth , most of them students , donot find time to help their communities .i am not denying the students  participation in the activities ngos and other social organizations .but their numbers are not much and a significant fraction of them do this work for personal advantages .this should be looked at more as a consequence of the changing lifestyles and culture .the role of decline in the importance of traditions , not in the significance of occasions and festivals , but following of the traditions in `` everyday living  , which has almost vanished is undeniable .the religion and the cultures have always preached `` giving back  to your community .the youth can not be alone blamed because this trend is generic .most people , with the exception of may be the older citizens who still stick on to their old habits and customs , donot show social concern for their communities .in the indian context all of the above have been most obstreperous .increased competetion could be thr driving force in decreased importance of other issues in the youth s point of view but the role of changing customs is nevertheless present .
