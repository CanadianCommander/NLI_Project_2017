i agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are three reasons to support my opinion .first of all , especially where i live in japan the population is getting smaller every year .some people estimate that the population would be half in the future .of course , when the population gets smaller , people who use cars will be decreased .second of all , the focus on the environment is getting bigger every year .without doubt , the fossil fuels that cars give to the air are very bad to the environment .so i think that the use of cars would be restricted internationally in twenty years .lastly , it is more dangerous to use cars than to use trains .the number of the traffic accident increases , so people might get to think that they should use trains to move because it is much less dangerous than to use cars .for those reasons , i definitely agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
