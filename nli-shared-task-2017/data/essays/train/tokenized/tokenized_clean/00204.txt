i think that a general knowledge of many academic subject is the best way to understand which will be my future work .i believe in this because of my last and still coming on the surface doubts about `` what i will be in the future  .infact if you would be listening to my telephone calls or discussions with my mother in the last times , for estance , you would discover me speaking rightly about this .i think in this period of the life , almost everybody has already decided what to do so this is why people decide to attend specialized courses , and to take part to lessons on specific subject .if your interest is so specific and you are sure about what are your passions and loves , you should nt waste your time and pick up specialized subject studies .but not for all the people , things are clear . ..this is my case , i have nt nearly a clue of i surely will be , or in which envoironment i would like to work in , maybe turism business ?maybe in the army ?is working in a bank the right choice ? ......i really do nt think so !an this is why i really trust in what i stated .an other problem is that the decision , applying the question on which the essay is based , on college choosing period of our life , an other factor come inside : time goes on .having the possibility to have more lifes i would surely try both approaches , attending specializing courses and lessons on a subject or few of them , then trying to find my way through , also having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .my answer , so my solution to the question , could not be so clear after what i m going to state right now , but , reading what i have just wrote above this final lines , you will be able to understand my vision :if we have already decided what we are going to do in the future we must `` carpediem  ( so take time by the hair ) , and pick a specializing academic path .but if we are not sure or we think our ideas will change , taking part to the study of many academic knowledge is the better decision .referring to the question `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  the first will be a more flexible choice then the second one .
