young people feel life inside , while old people loose their energy .this is the main difference i think .an old man has a lot of experience inside him ; he could feel tired sometimes : things are nt even more new , they do nt communicate the same sensation they were used to do in the past .in fact a young person knows that he has a whole life to live .he enjoy living looking at the future , while an old man lives looking at what he has lived in the past .a young person has the enjoy to create his future catching each single sensation coming from the outside ( the world ) .a baby is usued to enjoy everything because everything is new ; a very old person may feels like he has no more reason to live , and so his life becomes something like `` waiting for godot  , waiting for something trying to find some distraction to spend life .we have to underline that physical condiction is essential for enjoying life too : normally young people feel better so they can do a lot of things that old people ca nt , like sport , that rappresents an important way to satisfy ourselves .the preoccupation of healty is another main attitude that contribuites to make old people to life in fear .but this is nt always correct : it depends even on the society .i explain : in this years i can see that many friends of mine has lost their way of enjoying life  like they are missing something .they are just living waiting for a better future condition .my grandfather instead was used to have fun in each single moment of his life  even when he was said he would have died .it s wired i think .in my personal opinion i think we have to enjoy life always bacause it has given to us a great opportunity and we must not let it go away .
