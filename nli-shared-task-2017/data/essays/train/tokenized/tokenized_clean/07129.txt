having risk may mean to open l ?fe to new ares .it may be dangerous but it is necessry for developments , i believe .otherwise , most probably mankind would not come to the point he is at the moment .i will try to discuss how man ?mproved his exitence on earth taking risks and signing so many succesful project in the course of history .i will also support the idea from my own life .the first example to be given for such courageus initives would be the invention of fire .fire has been the most determining find in the history of man .the f ?rst person who found the fire obviously took an incredible risk in his or her life .apparently , it was not easy for that person to trancend the supersticions of his culture .but the person gifted a marvelous present to mankind .let me give you another example : colombus took a tremendous risk to reach to the new world .that great journey was the exploration of a new part of the world , of course , for the ones who lived in the east part of the word .as a matter of fact , it was so great a succes that the map of the world has changed after this succesfull but very risky journey .i would like to give you an example instane from myself .after graduation from high school i should have a university examination to enter university .my transcript did not show a great success in my high school education .i could accept this situation and i could go a university according to my level of success .with also the help and supprt oa my family , however , i embarked upon studying the examination .this was a turning poin in my life .rather tan sitting at home and waiting for my fate i tried to change my life course .it was a success and i could be able to enter a prestigious college .to change something in the world also means tking risk .our world improves with courageus initiatives of brave man , i believe .this has always been my principle in my life .
