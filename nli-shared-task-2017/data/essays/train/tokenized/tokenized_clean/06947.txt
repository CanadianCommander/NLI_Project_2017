i agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .basically our mind is like a fire which needs to be kindled and not a vessel to be filled up .ideas and concepts are the right catalyst to set our mind wondering and thinking on those topics .famous scientist albert einstein used the age old calculus to derive the theory of relativity .our inventions and discoveries have relations to the past .the present technologies owes a lot of its origin to the earlier generations .we can not do things abstract and all of a sudden out of the blue .it may appear to have happened that way , when we superficailly go through the matter .a deeper study reveals the connections , which are very interesting .facts are simple statistics .they are very important .they need to be collected and kept for rational reference .we take decisions based on facts not on ideas and concepts .so that is the role of facts in our life , i feel .for example , if we need to know whether a specific disease has become an epidemic and if the government needs to msuter more support and put in more efforts to curb the further spreading of the disease , we need to know the number of patients registered at the hospitals with the symptoms of that disease recently .these are essential in leading us to make a crucial decision .facts can be of various types .some about the past which would relate to the history of the land .some relate to who did what etc and some good to know information .they have their importance in the society .a students life is very important phase in his career .we need to choose carefully what he needs to understand to keep his inquisitiveness and mind in search of quests .this will take us a long way in builing a society where there will be no deficieny of innovations , discoveries and inventions to acclerate us towards further growth and development .
