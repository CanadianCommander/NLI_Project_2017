in today s academic world , one can see increased specification among different disciplines : even in the same discipline there are different subfields on which academicians focus .although it is a great way to progress within one field , the disadvantages should also be considered before taking a stance on the issue of the benefits and drawbacks of specification in knowledge / medical doctors can be used as metaphors while talking about the profundity of the knowledge .on the one hand , general health of a society depends on the general practitioners who can prevent diseases or give advice for healthy living to the public besides diagnosing and curing basic illnesses .on the other hand , the medical knowledge is extended to a degree that it is virtually impossible that one person could have all the information available on each and every problem which can occur within the human body .a specialist can come into the scene where a practitioner s knowledge about a health issue is insufficient to cure an illness .since a specialist is able to know more profoundly on a topic and has more time to be more up-to-date about an issue , he or she will be more help in solving the problem .it is important to keep in mind that generalists are as important as specialists .since speciallists concentrate deeply on an issue by making extensive research in their area of expertise , they tend to forget to see the broader picture .on the contrary , generalists are able to see the broader picture more easily since they have more limited knowledge about a lot of things .seeing from a broader perspective can help people to raise some questions about what is necessary and what is not in terms of scientific reaserch for example .it can be argued that inventions such as birth control pills are initiated by the general need for an effective mean to prevent unwanted pregnancies .as an invention which changed a lot of peoples  lives in posotive terms would not be available if the progress was only depended on specialists who concentrate only one issue .it is clear that we live in a time where extensive knowledge is accumulated through the course of humanity .it is very different from the times that it was possible to be a rennaissance man where loenardo for example could make paintings and do designs and inventions at the same time .however , we still need people in academia who know a lot about the general course of the history as well as specialists who know deeply on a given topic .we need them both to progress .
