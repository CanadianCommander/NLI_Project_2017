it is natural that a student studying harder can get higher grade than others .however , if he dose nt study efficiently , he will not get a result as he expects .i firmly believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .this is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduced the necessity of learning facts themselves .to begin with , students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful , for example , most subjects in school require logical thinking rather than memorizing facts .when i was in high school , i was one of the book worms .however , my grade was not improved as much as i studied .at the freshman years , i did nt know the reason but i became to know the reason after i met my freind , james , in the second year .he always tried to understand the ideas and concepts so that he studied very efficiently and got better grade than me .on top of that , i think people who can understand ideas and concepts are also love in society because they can solve problems quickly .to be sucessful students try to understand the ideas and conceptssecondly , variouse accessible sources on the internet reduced the neccesity of learning facts themselves .to be specific , in the time when people had difficulties finding information , people depended on their memory a lot .however , now people can access internet to gather general information as much as they want .this means people do not need to memorize general things .in conclusion , i believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .this is not only because students need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible sources on the internet reduced the necessity of learning facts themselves .
