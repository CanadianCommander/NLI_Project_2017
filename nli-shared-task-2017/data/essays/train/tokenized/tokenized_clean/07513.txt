yes , i do agree with the given statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .this can be explained with various examples .to begin with , the elder people didnot enjoy much priviledges .the society was not that developed .they had no clubs , the advanced technolgies to communicate .if they existed , they were in minimum numbers .whereas , the generation of today , gets to enjoy life to a much better extent .they have clubs , pubs and various other hangouts to keep themselves alive all the time .young people are free from various fear and responsibilites that comes with the old age .older people are much more prone to a lot of physical problems / diseases .whereas , young people do not face these physical problems more often .this also gives them that youthful and ` always-up-for-party  attitude .this can also add up to prove that the statement is right saying young people enjoy life more than older people do .moreover , the advancement in technology nowadays has made communication and interaction much more easy as compared to the earlier times .this acts as a medium of interaction between two strangers and can often be a starter for a dating , later shaping ito a relationship .this can certainly add up to the enjoyment .the older people in earlier times didnot enjoy such ease of communication .another point which can be a reason for the given statement can be the generation gap .it can be quite difficult for the older people to communicate or understand the problems faced by young people at times .the older generation is still stuck up with the old orthodox view point .this can act as a barrier in their lives sometimes when it comes to enjoying life .thus , to conclude , the above points give various examples to support the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
