it is understood that the purpose of advertisements is to attract the publics attention in many possible ways .these could be by using extravagant colours , catchy slogans , songs and nowadays even special effects are sometimes included .catching the `` eye  is only the first step , the advertisement s job is also to give the best possible image of the product being showed .sometimes the overuse of misusage of technologies , such as special effects or words in the advertisement might lead to cause false impressions on the public .i definetly think though that this situation is rarely seen .advertisements today make products seem `` cooler  in order to atract attention , but in retrospective the product seen is the same one you might purchase later at the store .it would be very difficult for this statement to become a reality nowadays .several consumer rights laws prevent that companies or corporations give a false impressiong of their products .what is advertise is usually what you get acoording to the law .as a consumer you are now entitled to demand the product you were informed of and also any other benefits this product shall provide to you .for instance lets take a dr. pepper ad , it might describe you the taste , the package and the price , that is exactly what you ll get in the store , the background music and the young actors in the advertisement surely are not included , they are just visual aids .another example is a hair growth product or a dieting pill , consumer rights protect you from the possible lies that the corporations may induce in the ad .at the end of the treatment you might not look exactly like the people showed in the advertisement , but you wil loose weight and grow hair .in my personal experience i think that advertisements might be more shocking than they used to be , they tend to atract more my attention that a few years ago that s for sure .nevertheless the product that i am offered is always the one i get when i buy it , never better just exaclty what i expected .
