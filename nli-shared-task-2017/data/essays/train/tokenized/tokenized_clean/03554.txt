i agree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the present situation of the man demands his time and full energy wherein he is busy all the day with hectic schedules of his work .as the saying , ` man is a social animal  depicts that , today s man lives in the society , for the society and with the society .so he wants to just go along with other people to grab for the oppurtunities for his betterment of needs and betterment of his future .if he do not do this for himself , he will definitely lag behind and keep on waiting for the chances to go along with the society .with all these tensions in the mind , today s man is unable to give time helping his communities .let us take my example only , i am a doctor by my profession and i was an athelete when i was in my college days .i use to play cricket at national level .that time i had a thought in my mind that i should pick up some beautiful players and train them perfectly and send them for national and international games .i started with collecting the members of various colleges and i made a real strong group of cricket team .but later when i was busy with my hectic schedules , i could nt concentrate much on my particular small community and i left them alone which posed a remarkable effect on my mind .there are many communities like physically handicapped and oldage people , where the young generation should really look into and try to spend some time helping them out .they can spend little time for them and little money which would make them mentally relaxed and feel well that there is someone who is caring about them .i finally conclude by saying that `` what goes around will come around  .when you do something good for the betterment of the society , that will definitely help you out atleast in later stages of your life .
