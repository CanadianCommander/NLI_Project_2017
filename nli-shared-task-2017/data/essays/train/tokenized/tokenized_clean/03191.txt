i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .i disagree mainly by three reasons .first , even though the tour guide is an specialist in the zone or city that you are going to visit and you can get a more complete knowledge of that zone or city , i think that a good book of the city can supply in a correct way the knowledge of the tour guide .a good book have history of the city , routes of interest , architectural and archeological points to visit and legends of the city among other things .using a book of the city in your travel can help you both to acquire the knowledge that you would acquire with the tour guide and to plan the route to follow .second , when you travel with a tour guide , you have the schedules restriction .for example the plan says 8 am breakfast , 9 am visit to the museum , 1 pm eating ...and you have to respect the schedule .you do not have enough freedom .on the other hand , when you travel without a tour guide , you can assign the time that you want to the different activities .if you want , you can get up more late in the hotel , or if the visit to the museum is bored , you can end the visit and go to drink a coke or visit other thing .in other words , you can assign the time to every activity , and not be restricted by an schedule .you can enjoy the places by the time that you want , no by the time that a tour guide wants .third , traveling with a tour guide , restrict you the route or itinerary .for example your travel can be limited to 7 or 8 places and you can not add or quit a place .traveling with a tour guide will allow you to decide wich places to visit .your travel will not be limited by a determined number of places .if you want you can add or quit places to visit , the route is not fix .you can visit the places that most attracts your attention .in conclusion , for me is more exciting to travel without a tour guide because i can get more freedom in my travel and i can decide which places to visit and for how many hours .i am not limited by the schedules or routes of a tour guide .
