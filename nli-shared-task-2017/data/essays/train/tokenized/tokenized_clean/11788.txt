there have always been varying opinons on the importance of learning facts or in contrast the understanding of ideas while studying .in my opinion the way a student should handle his stdudying depends first very much on the relevant field of study .for example studying history requires the knowledge of certain historical data .these are facts tha have to be learned , they can not be derived frim the understanding of a concept .so there is an importance for the students to learn them .on the other hand studying economics , the are a lot of models and ideas the students have to understand in order to be sucessful .those can no be learned . .but can the student of history gain success in his studying only by learning facts ?no he can not .he also has to understand for example the strutures of ancient societies .and can the student of economies be a good econimist just by understanding many of the econimic models and ideas ?again no .there is also the need to combine this understanding with certain facts or formulars that simply have yo be learned .another important fact is also the type of person one student is .some people can keep fact they have read in their minds easily , but its hard for them to understand concepts behind .others have diffculties in remembering facts , but are likely to draw right conclusions from concepts they have understood once .so it can not be said that simply learning facts , or understanding ideas is the key to sucessful studying .the solution should be a sensible mixture of the two extremes .depending on what the aim of studying is and also depending on what one s preferences and talent are .
