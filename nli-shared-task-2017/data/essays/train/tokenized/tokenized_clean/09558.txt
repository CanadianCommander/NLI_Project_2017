my personal experience leads me to state that knowing the facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts , mainly because i think one should try to be as indepenent as possible in life , this including the way one s own ideas are formed after being explained from a third party in order to be understood .i think what i am looking for is probably an impossible concept : objective information , or any facts one would like to make research on that are not pre-processed or in any way filtered .facts , although affacted by who they are represented and reported by , are far more objective than ideas and concepts that may be communicated by other people , simply because if one is given the idea or concept already , he or she will not be given the right to a more personal judgment .i think this topic particularly affects me , since i have progressively become aware of how much more knowledge of facts i need in order to understand the present matters of the society i live in .this includes the understanding of politics in my country in the first place and internationally in the second place , obviously followed by history .recently i finally manged to find some time out of my schedule for reading more about the histoy of the last century in italy , while the next step will be the people s history , a book on the american history , probably followed by some reasearch on another main topic of our recent times : wars on terror and their political as well as historical backgrounds .i am convinced that only facts can make me have the whole picture and that only a vast eagle view on them , as a multiple-sourced investigation can offer , will eventually lead closer to a better , more solid objective idea , concept or belief to stick with when choosing in life .
