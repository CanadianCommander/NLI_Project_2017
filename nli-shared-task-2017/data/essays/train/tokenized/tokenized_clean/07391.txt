today it looks like more and more people try to stay young .but why is staying young so attractive for many people ?do young people have more fun ?in our days it seems to be a trend to stay young .the media supports this thinking a lot by its comercial .many people today are influenced by tv and radio and follow this trend to stay young .to look as good as all the people on tv , many people bye products that are represented by the media .they by creams or go to the gym in order to look better .following the media that much is a big problem today because many people think that by staying young they are more attractive to other people .in addition , many people think that they can have more fun if they stay young .in my oppinion this is a big mistake .young people do not have more fun than older people .having fun depends on a person itself .people can have fun in every stage of their life .it just depends on themselves and what they do .there are many adolescence who do not have a lot of fun because this stage of life can be a very difficult one fore many young people .it is the time where the body changes a lot .young people have to deal with this changement .during this period of time many young people have problems with their friends and families .this underlines that being young is not allways the best time for everybody .in conclusion we can not generalize when people have the most fun of their live .that depends on the people themselves and what kind of life they lead .fore some people the statement `` young poeple enjoy life mire than older people do  is truth and for other people it is wrong .it is important that people do not try to follow the media as much .because looking younger does not make anybody more happy .
