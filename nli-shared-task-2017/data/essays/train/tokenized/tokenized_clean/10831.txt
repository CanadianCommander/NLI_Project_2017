i support the argument that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .in today s context and scenario the concept of benevolence and brotherhood no longer exist .the youngsters these days have become so obsessed with the materialistic pleasures that they tend to overlook or appreciate the environment they have been brought up in .they are part of a rat race and constantly competing with their contemporaries so as to get ahead of them .they seem least bothered when it comes to actually doing something for the benefit of someone else .it is the `` i , me , myself  scenario that prevails today .i can say from personal experience that the essence of belonging to a community is lost let alone helping others !in the stranglehold of societal demands , we are all subjected to just working for ourselves , to achieve as much as possible - more perhaps , if achievable !its all about goals , targets and results .we seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , we , the human race must live in cooperation and share a symbiotic relationship with every other being .we must learn to ` give  and not just ` take  - for the sake of morality if nothing else !but morals and principles are a thing of the past , long gone and forgotten .we tend to forget that only when we give something do we get something in return .but again , just for our own selfish reasons we must not resort to helping anybody else .the realisation must come from within , it must be like an awakening that would lead us to helping others , sharing with others and creating an amible and comfortable environment .as citizens of a community , it is our responsibility to give other members their due .it is indeed the need of the day to reinstute the values of helping others for the upliftment of society and the entire human community .
