i think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .when studying , and in life in general , it is important to comprehend rather than using the memory to repeat words or facts that eventually will not have sense in the near future .facts are still important and should not be forgotten .still , the ability to understand ideas and concepts makes it possible to reason and discuss about topics and matters .we humans are able to make logical connections using our ( limited ) memory and few facts .we can understand the real meaning of facts .and we can reason on what it is behind a fact , we can tell why a fact has happend .on the other hand , computers and the internet are in a certain sense `` stupid  , but they can come to our help and support when we look for facts .with an internet access we can consult online sources such as wikipedia and google .these are some of the best tools for looking for facts and these are the tools we should know how to use .to summarize , for students , in my opinion , is more important to understand and reason on concepts and ideas rather than memorize mechanically facts , dates and numbers .students will need to be able to think and reason , computer will help to `` connect the dots  .
