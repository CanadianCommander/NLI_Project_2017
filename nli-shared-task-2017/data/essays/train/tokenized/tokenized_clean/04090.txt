i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is very important for young people to help their communities , because the society is not made of individuals rather a group of people .today , the most of the young people have neglecting attitudes towards their communities .they dont care what is happening in their communities and what is being done is correct or not .there are several reasons for such an attitude among young people towards their communities .first of all , they are not motivated enough to help their community .their parents and other family members do not tell them about their duties towards their communities .they dont encourage them to help their communities .this may be because of the several reasons like the family dont have enough time to spend time with their children and talk about all these .secondly , now a days young people dont get enough time to help their communities .now young people have more responsibilites , more competition to face .the studies have become more tougher .students have to take lot of examinations to get admission into schools and colleges .so they spend most of time thinking and preparing about their studies .this stops them from thinking about their communities .for example , a student who is preparing for an entrance to get admission into a graduate school will have limited time to think about his responsibilities towards his community .also young people think that its not their duty alone to help their community .they have a wrong notion in their mind that why only they should help their communities , and not the others belonging to the same community should come forward and help .so they keep waiting for the others only to take the initiative and finally nobody makes a positive move .but the young people should realize that even they are part of the community .they should think that if they help now , they will get the help when they require it .so they should understand their responsibities and try to find some time to helping their communities .
