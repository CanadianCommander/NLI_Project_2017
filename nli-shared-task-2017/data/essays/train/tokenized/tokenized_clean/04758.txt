i agree with those who believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities , for the following reasons : in my town there a lot of helping centres , many young guys take part to activities for disadvantage people and i am an example of young boy who help someone else .first of all , in my country there are fifty ( more or less ) associations that are pawned in social aspects , like drugs or children sick , that look for young people to learn the meaning of helping other and want to insert them in these communities .for example the abio association , which deals with children with great diseases , has got a specif group of teenagers from 16 to 19 years old that three days a weeks goes to the hospital and they take care children or they organize something of amusement for them .furthermore in many schools of my town , guys , who help others , meet the students in a conference to tell them their experience and how helping communities his enjoyable for their soul .i took part in one of this conference and i remembered an episod .one of these guys showed us some photographs of children who lived in africa .they were very ill , most of them died at the early age of 5-6 years .during this demonstration a big silent fell in the room and everyone made a reflection about what he or she has just saw .i was 17 years old , and from that moment i understood that in the world there are a lot of disadvantage children that should live a moment of happiness in their life .so i made a decision and now i am one of the numerosous young people that two or three time a weeks dedicate their free time to make a smile in which children who are suffering for a terrible disease .to sum up , i think that every guys should look in your heart and should prove to help the others .if it is necessary i will enjoy to teach it them when i will be qualified as the boy that i met .
