to success in this life , we have to do all what is possible and sometimes even the impossible .i agree that successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because the evolution of our life requires this .to be a succeful person you should be tenace and lucky .suppose you are tenace , you work with patience and perseverance furthermore you need luck to success but luck is under control .to success you need time and favorable conditions , our life becomes more and more rapide and the evolution of humankind will not wait until you arrive to your goal , therefore to go with the prevailing movement you are obliged to take som risks and to try new things .in fact many systems and many methods were , for thier inventors , just a try or a risk at the beguinig , now they are accurate and subect of reference .their owners were couragous .in other words , you should be couragous and ready to the all consequences of this act .however its not easy to take a risk or try a new thing , you have no idea about what will happen and the consequences may be dangerous , but as i said before you hjave to try and take risk if you want success .
