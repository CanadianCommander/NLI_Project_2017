in the last couple of decades , - uninvited - the field of advertising has expanded vastly into the everyday life human beings .no matter where people are ; at their homes , on the street or in a movie theater an advertisement will be waiting for them to promote a commodity , no matter how good or bad it is in reality .given that the power of advertisement is obvious in our age there appears to be no reason why it would not be able to sell products which do not deserve to be bought , given their quality and price .thus the advertisements often do make products sold by making them seem better than they are .the first way of making a product look good is the use of clean images and role models , introducing the product as a saver of the individual .for instance in wax commercials the product seems to remove all the hair from the body never to return .the viewer sees the image of a top model who probably never had much body hair at all , looking at her eyes and telling her that she could be smooth like her if sheused the product .imitating someone we like or trust is an old habit of human beings , thus the customer buys the wax and in a few months she realizes that the wax actually feeds the roots of the hair and just a few weeks following the epilation she will have even stronger body hair , harder to remove .the second way that advertising makes bad commodities sold is repetition , so as to say the frequency of commercials .whenever a new product is introduced to the public the advertisements are shown dozens of times in such short times to brainwash the viewers and finally making them think why they remember this product so well .in time they begin to believe that they remember it probably because it is a good and they feel the urge to try it at least once .that is how they go to the mall and grab the advertised product .a very good example of this can be observed in turkey where the singer ajdar has sold hundreds of thousands of his album just because his rather funny songs were repeated in almost every 2 hours on tv , while the turkish popstar tarkan suffered from a conflict that existed between him and his advertising agency and barely sold fifty thousand with his flashing album .advertisements are everywhere wheter for the bad or for the worse .they have already sneaked into the minds of the consumers with the support of a long history of visual communication skills and tricks .therefore it seems like anything that is bought for any price may not be the best choice .
