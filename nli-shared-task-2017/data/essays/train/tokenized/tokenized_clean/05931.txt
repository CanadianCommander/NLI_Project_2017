nowadays , there are lots of cars around the world .perhaps there will be at least one car for each family .cars provide lots of benefits to us now , but it will also bad to all of us in the future .more cars provide bigger problems to us .because of this there will be fewer cars in twenty years .firstly , car is the main source of air pollution .now there are thosands of millions of cars in the world and each of them are producing carbon dioxide .if you see the city from the outside of the city , we can easily see the city is smugged .the place where i live , which is jakarta is one of the famous country for air pollution and have lots of cars .when i go out with my car , i can not open the window , because of the air pollution .if the air pollution is keep increasing , we can not live in earth anymore .to decrese the air pollution , we have to decrease the numbers o the cars .secondly , the resource of the car is oil and the oil in the earth is limited .as the oil is decreasing , the price of the oil will keep increasing .that is the reason that oil is keep increasing in indonesia .i have been lived in indonesia for 8 years .the price of the oil right now is twice more expensive then it was in 8 years ago .that is because in indonesia , there are not much oil as before .in the future , the price of the oil will be extremely expensive , so lots of people can not ride cars , because they can not buy oils , even though they have cars .in conclusion , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars , because the oil and the pollution .not only leave it to decrease the number by itself , we have to try ourselves more to make it fewer for us .
