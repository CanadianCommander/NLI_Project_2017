i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .first of all , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics because the price of car fuels , gasoline and gas oil , will be raising .for example , i remember that in 2003 when i was in my first year at showa-shell-sekiyu , a large oil company in japan , gasoline price of japanese market was less than one dallor .however now , it is raised about one half dollars .as the above example shows , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics .second , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars .for example when i was a eleventh grader at okayama joto high school , a public high shool in japan , i was able to swim in the river next to my high school after school .but now , the river has been very duty because the new road was made by the river and a lot of drivers throw away their garbage in the river .at last , our city makes a new low of emitting from the gas oil cars .if the number of cars had been increasing , the beautiful environment would have lost away .as the above example demonstrates , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars .in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
