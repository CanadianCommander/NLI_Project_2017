in nowadays , the rate of increasing cars is faster than ever before .it is true that car has many benefits for moving from place to another place .however , i strongly agree that there will be less cars than now in twenty years because of following reasons .first of all , a car is a main cause of many pollution problems .by using of gasoline to drive a car , car makes much co or other kinds of harmful gases which provokes air pollution .these pollutions have been accumulated for many years so that nature disastors which we can not explain scientifically occurs recently .according to a survey which is investigated all over the world by green peace , which is one of the famous environmental organizations , over 80 % people of who suffered from the nature disasters believe that substances which are made by car has been made disasters .moreover , the goverment is making laws about the limiting of using a car because of the pollution .another significant reason is that the amount of oil which is a very popular resource to drive a car is decreasing .as everybody know , the amount of oil which is saved under the ground is limited and its price is increasing fastly .according to a geological professor in the united states , the rest of oil will finish only for 12 years if we use oils in the same rate as now .as more expensive the price of oil is , less people drive a car .for example in my country , when the oil prices was going up 10 % of the price , 20 % of the drivers gave up to drive a car .although there are other sources such as electricity or hybrid , howere , it needs time more than 20 years to be common .to make a long story short , the population of driving a car will be decresing in a few years because of pollution and expensive oil .therefore , there will be fewer cars in use than today .
