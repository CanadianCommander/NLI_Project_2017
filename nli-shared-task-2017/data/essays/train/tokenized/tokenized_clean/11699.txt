i agree with the statement for several reasons and i will try to explain them through my personal experience .i m really convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .while attending my university i had the chance to study many different matters and all of them equipped me with a multitudo of skills .most of the researches i carried out for my university studies were related to the international law which i am very passionate about .i took every single exam that could give me the chance to deepen my knowledge about international topics .thus , my studies included elements of international law , comparative law , european law . ..upon obtaining my degree in law , it has been my goal to work in an internationa organisation and today i believe that those skills i learned at university will play sooner or later an important role in my working future .to tell the truth , my hard study from university has already played an important role and this is the reason why i am positive that acquiring and understanding ides and concepts before learning facts is important for students .if i had not studied the basics of international law at university , i would have not been able to pass the selections for an internship at the europea parliament .in fact , the students who wanted to apply for an internship whithin the european parliament had to demonstrate to know how this international organization works in theory .only the students who were able to pass the test would attend the internship .since i studied hard before applying for that position and i knew well the structure of the most important european institutions , i managed to pass the selections .i went to bruxelles where i spent the most exciting time in my life thanks to my study done earlier at university .after the internship i also acquired pratical knowledge of the european parliament , which has added something useful to my whole preparation .it is then important , in my opinion , for students to pay attention to ideas and concepts .
