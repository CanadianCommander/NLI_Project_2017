as far as i am concerned , young people have not all the same behaviour with their community .obviously , different people have different interests and thoughts .as a consequence , this question is extremely difficult .however , i quite agree whit this statement .in fact , i think that almost all young children who live in my neighbourhood do not take care our community .last year , for istance , i have helped the priest of my church to look after some elderly people who had some deseases .i have to do this activity with other people of my community , but only one person was a friend of mine , i mean a person who has my age .another example was the little party that my community organise every summer at the end of the school .this is an occasion for us , who live very close , to meet each other , and have fun together .in this day a lot of children and young people participate to the event .however , they usually do nothing to organise this party .only your parents either cook delicious cakes and other foods or organised games , such as volleyball or football .according to me , there are a lot of reasons young children have in order not to help their community .first of all , they attend school in the morning , and in the afternoom they should do their homework .othertime , the practice sports all the afternoon or meet same friends of their in order to relieve stress and have fun , and so on .for example , last year i started to attend university quite far from my house , consequently i have spent less time in my community and i can understand the problem young people have to face .taking everything into account , it is true that nowadays only few young people do something to improve their communities .however , i think that help our communities is both a right and a duty for everyone .in particular young children can either improve many skills by doing this , or learn important knowledge for their future life , that are not writter in books .
