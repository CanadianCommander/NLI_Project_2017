i ca nt agree this statement .why i think so , there are some reasons .firstof all , when i go on a trip in a group led by a tour guide , i have to do everything with my group .for example , i have to eat the same food what group people eats , i have to see the popular tourist attruction where very crouded with the amount of people with group people , and so on .next , i love to stay at a rich hotel and relax , because the most of my perpous of go traveling is relaxing .however , pack tour s timetable is too tight for me to relax , and there are many people in a group , so i do nt relax .walking around unfamiliar place without some maps and brouches is also a relaxing .i can found my favorite seanery where people do nt know .the most important reason why i think go on a trip not to use a pack tour is boring .travel agencys want to make a very cheap tour to buy a lot of tickets as many as they can , so pack tour is more boring than other travel .when i use such a pack tour , i will go to the very famous plase to see , but i do nt like such a famous place .probably , there are many people in a such a very famous place , and i will be not able to find that i really want to see a worthseeing place or a lot of people .i do nt want to have such an experience .therefore , i disagree with the statement
