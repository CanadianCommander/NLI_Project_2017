there are two common ways to travel now .one is travelling in a group led by a tour guid ; the other one is going by oneself .they both have their own advantages .the choice might depend on travelers  own abilities and personalities .i know travelling with a group and a tour guide has been mostly accepted by people .people who chose this way are likely travel to the places with long historical or curtural back ground like china europe without the knowledge about them , so they need a guide .they may have no special needs such as the diet of food , the room condiction , the schedule of planing or staying at one place they most like for more time .moreover , traveling with a group will help people , especially lazy ones , to get rid of booking the hotel , finding some where to have meal or even which place they should go .compare with the way above , as a person with more personalities and needs , i reather to travel by myself or with my best friends .firstly , i think the most interesting step of a whole journey is not staying at the place you travel to but the process of planning for the whole trip .imagine that you can sit arround a table with hot coffe , think of how lovely the period of the trip will be and discuss or argue with your friend about where you guys should go .that s very attractive to me .secondly , i love natural views more than historical buildings , so i can totally go to a place that does nt need be far , dones nt need a guide there or even does nt have a name .i can enjoy the view and take picture of that , and share thatwith my friends .i can stay as long as i wish to and go anywhere i like for my next station .without feeling hurry , without feeling being contraled , the two words in my mind are relaxation and freedom .that is the meaning of travel , is nt it ?
