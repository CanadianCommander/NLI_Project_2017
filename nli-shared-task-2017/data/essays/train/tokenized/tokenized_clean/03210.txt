the statement , ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  is telling us that , to success you have to try new things and take risks rather than always doing the way you are really good at .i agree with the statement .i think it helps to make something you are not really good and and make it one of the things you are good at .it also make you experience many things and smetimes success , and sometimes fail .that teach us what is right and what is wroge .in your life , you have to try many things .when you are a baby , you have to try oto get up and walk .if you do nt start with that kind of risks , you will never walk , and not be like a normal person .taking risk might be something very diffecult .it might also be very easy .when you try something , you can like it , or yo9u can hate it .it s all your chose .for example , this term , it tried for all the sport teams in school .i thought i was really bad at basssket ball , but when i tarted the team , i figure out that i really liked it , and was actually beter than what i thought .making my self made me have a new hubby and try more to be better at it .tring and taking risks helps you to learn what is wright and what is wronge .when you try , you sometimes success , and somtimes fail .my dad told me that fail make you success more and help learn what to do next to not fail t  at the same thing .for exampel , my brother really liked tennis even though he did nt do it .when he tried , he find out that he did nt like it at all .from then , he did nt do tennis , and find out that one of his hobby was nt really his hobby .in that case , he failed and also successed on what he tried .he failed on guessing what his hobby was , but he successed in finding out what his really hobby was .i think successful people alway try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it helps people to try and be good at something you tried .it also makes you learn what is right and what is wrong and make you not do the mistake you did again when you do it again .
