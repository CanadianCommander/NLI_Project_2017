i agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than the old people do .age is an important factor in a person life and it , in many ways the way he leads it .youngsters have a zeal and enthusiasm in them within them and look at life with hope and happiness .it is the ideal age to experience life and each day gives a new chance for a new attempt and each attempt gives a new moral .generally people under their 30 s , have the hope that they can achieve their goals and also they believe that they have the energy to do it .it is this energy that corporate multinational organisations look for .a typical senior citizen would lack enthusiasm and zeal in their lifeand this dullness is quite natural .they have already tasted the variety in life and anything gets boring when one gets used it .very few things seem new to them and this makes life quite spiceless .the physical conditions of youngsters helps them to enjoy life a lot better .they have the agility in their bodies and more importanly they have better immunities that helps them stay healthy .the bodies of the senior citizens lack agility and they are more prone to irregular blood pressures , heart attacks , diabetes etctec .they have to constrain their activities and due to this they may not be able to enjoy life to the maximum .the biggest problem with the old is the feelin of being unwanted .old people may have the feelin of loneliness and may feel dejected as they may lose their friends , partners , parents , the busy schedule of thier children and the other beloved younger group , worsens this feeling .this feeling could stop them from enjoying life .th younger lot have the beloved ones with them and spending time with them brings back color to the otherwise dull life .psychologies change with age and it is not possible for the senior people to have the same psychology they had in thier youth .so .they might not have the same joy and cheerful life they had in theri youth where they would move round with friends , partying and also a trying to make an image of thier own the society .
