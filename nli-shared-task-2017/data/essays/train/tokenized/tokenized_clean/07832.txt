nowadays young people are confronting to increasing pressure from working and studying , and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday .although it is true , i still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do .it is a generally considered that almost all products of new technology are accepted , mastered and being used by young people first , so do the ones to provied convience and enjoy .young students , for example , have used to communicate with cell-phones while their grand parents still use old and big normal telephone .although airplane has been common in china for tens of years , some older people still refuse to travel by airplane , for they think it is dangerous and a waster of money .old people refuse to or do nt know how to use many new products and can hardly receive benifits from modern society than young people .besides , it is obviously that young people are the natural leaders of the new fashion , and it is also a common sense that entainment , which is highly development in modern cities , are always first accepted by young people .for instance , while i went to bars with my friends in my free time , my mother merely stayed in home with doing nearly nothing even she had enough free time .only when she was invited to a bar by her younger friends , she found it really a good place to get released .another fact is that a recent social study indicates that less than 70 percent of people who live in big cities of china receive benifits from new technology , and few of them are old people whose age is above 55 .moreover , enjoying life does not only shown on using the new products and enjoying entainments , but also the activities in society .the social concept of older people are not open enough even though the freedom and democrate of the society is progressing rapidly , especially in china .several researches have evdiently pointed out that the people who is older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of the society , and by this they can hardly enjoy the real freedom and democrate , which plays a important role in young people s daily life .from social activites i can release myself and win admire from others , which is essential to keep me feeling well .unfortunatly , my grand parents can not enjoy all of these .above , i think it is nature that young people enjoy life more than older people do , for their different in characties and the attitude to the new things .while it is a fact that young people are facing to heavier pressure , i think it is worth to face , for we really enjoy a lot .
