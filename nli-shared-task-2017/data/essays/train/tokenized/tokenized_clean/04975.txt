there are many advertisement that is made for many things .car , food , toys , companies and etc .us regular people who watch these advertisement defenetly grabs our attention making us buy the product or use it .as my opinion i think products that are advertised do look better than what they really are for many reasons .many food commercial makes the product look very tasty juicy and big .they also add special effects that makes it look even better .but truth is that its just an average food that people eat .many fast food restraunt tries to attract as many costumer as possible inorder to sell more product as much as possible .in my experience i once went to a restraunt because the commerical looked very good .as soon as i get there the food looked totally different from the commercial and it did nt taste as good as i thought it would be by watching the ad .secondly many adverstisements use celebrities .many people are attracted to this because many will think if this celebrity is using this product it must be amazing .people tends to lured in to this trap .i also have an similar experience that i faced when i was a little boy .i loved to play baseball and my favorite baseball player was mike piazza .one day i saw a commercial about him using a bat .he says that this is the best bat that i ve ever used in mu life .i chose to buy this bat with out any doubt in my mind .but i find out that the quality of the bat was very bad .lastly , many company use professional to advertise their product .many professional advertisers use their words and exageration to catch the customers attention .oxy-clean for example was an product that was said that it ll get rid of every dirt and stains possible .on commerical they showed that it really do work .but after you try the product you ll see that the product does not have the same outcome as on television .most product are usually much better than it really is .many company try to trick the customers by making exagerations and special effects on the commercials so people will buy their product .the truth is that its not as good as its on advertisements .as you can see i agree to the statement because of the reasons above
