traveling is for me the best way to get to know newpeople and their culture .by traveling you will know different places and experience the trip in your own skin is something that you will never forget .you can read many books about a particular place but it is only when you travel that you understand the culture , architecture , etc. of that place .many people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and i totally disagree with that statment .i think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map .i have several reasons for holding that opinion .first of all , traveling in groups with a tour guide does not give you the freedom to move around that you might want .when you travel by yourself you decide where to go and when .for example i remmember when i traveled in a group of fifteen persons with a tour guide in paris four years ago .i planned and scheduled all my trip with this group and its guide because i did not want to travel alone .it turned out that i had a really bad experience with them .i was required to get up very early in the morning because the excursions started at sunrise .imagine that experience for me that i am not a morning person ! .moreover i did not get along with the people in the group .there was a big age difference that conditioned all our decisions .when i wanted to go to a pub at night the rest of the group preferred to stay at the hotel playing cards .i think they did nt realize they were in paris .secondly , traveling in groups with guide is far more expensive than traveling by yourself .you can decide where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alone .you know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it .for example , you can decide to pay a boat around the river instead of paying a museum .to sum up i think that traveling alone far outweigh the fact of traveling in groups .i must also say that the information that a tour guide can give you during the trip can also be found in many travel guides and books .so you might want to read a little bit before departuring .
