i agree with that fact the most advertisements products seem much better than they really are .it has to be that way , would you want to buy anything that does nt look good or seems not useful ?like it says , it s `` advertising  .for example , the mc donald s big mac seems really big , yummy , and tasty but the real big mac is nt really that big as showing as an advertising .they just put more stuff to make it look bigger and use frash ingrediants for the advertising .if it does nt seem like that big and tasty , people wo nt want to eat .it s all about the advertising that people want to eat and buy things .and also , i think the better advertising satisfy people s mind .for example , on the car advertising , who does nt want to buy nice mercedes or bmw ?but all the poeple ca nt afford them .when you look at the honda civic s advertising , it looks fancy as mercedes , too .you know it s not that fancy or nice as them but you just look at the advertising and satisfy yourself .the advertising uses certain places , models , concepts , lightings , and ect , to make the product look better .on the clothing advertising , someone who extreamly georgous model wearing silk coctail dress , you would want to buy it .that s what models are for .in conclusion , the adversitings are not lying but it just has to be look good .that s what advertisings are for .
