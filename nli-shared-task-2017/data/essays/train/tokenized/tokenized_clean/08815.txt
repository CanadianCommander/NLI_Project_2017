advertising products is very important for the companies and without doing it , the chance of making a big profit is a slim one .you can see and hear commercials almost everywhere , if it s on television , radio or on the street .but are the products really as good as they always look like in commercials ?in my opinion they are not .there are a few reasons why i think this way .first , the food always looks so delicious on tv and advertisements , but if you go to the store or make them products by yourself it never looks like the picture on the package .there it always looks shinier , everything seems to be seperated when they cook it and it seems to smell very good .i heard before they use something to polish their products so it looks shinier , they also use only the best and good looking food and sometimes they even replace it with plastic imitations .for example if they show you a delightful chocolate bar , it s usually just a piece of plastic made look identical to the bar .and if you buy it sometimes you might be disappointed , because it looks a lot different , it s smashed or crumbly .second , cleaning products are not always as easy to handle as the television shows it to their customers .for example the new swiffer duster , which is a fluffy cotton pad on a plastic stick .on tv the woman just takes one of those pads and sticks it on the plastic handle .in my personal experience it took me quite a long time get it all together and even if it s handier than the regular dust cloth it still does nt clean as good as the old method .finally , clothes are another major point in my suggestion that advertised products look better in commercials .you always see them good looking women and men on tv that seem to have a perfect body for any kind of clothes .when i go to the store and try the same ones on i usually get disappointed , because they do nt look nearly as good as they do on the models .there are quite a few reasons why most products are nt as good as the ones in the advertisements .but there are some that i bought and i am very satisfied with and do nt want to miss them in my house .
