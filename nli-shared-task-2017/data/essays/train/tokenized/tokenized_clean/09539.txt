many people want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .they think others will show respect to them because of their broad knowledge .of course , to know a lot costs time and energy .it s a provement of one s ability .if one does have broad knowledge but not specialize in any subjects , does it good for him or her ?i do nt think so .if one has broad knowledge of many academic , he or she would nt have enough time to specialize in any of the subjects as the human-being s ability and energy are limited .but the fact is , most people should or would have works in a certain period of time .a certain work needs one to own a specific ability to solve certain problems .that means the one who have lots of knowledge of many subjects ca nt do anything at all .their knowledge are too superficial to deal with any problems .so this kind of people are likely to loose their jobs as their knowledge ca nt help anything .they are like some old-fashion liberaries .another inefficiency is that they do nt gain as much satifactory feeling as the people who are specialize in one specific subject .their broad knowledge may come from books , lectures or internet .but they just recite the things which are provided by others .they ca nt make up anything or develope any ideas as they spend all their times in searching other s comments or points of view .in contrast , the people who are specialize in one specific subject can think of ideas they are interested in more thoroughly and deeply than others .they may gain something by their own .we all know that creation can make one pride and content .of course , repeating others  things ca nt be called creation .so the people who have broad knowledge can never feel this kind of feelings .what i mean is not to suggest people to study only one subjects .to know many things can bring benefits to us .but at the same time , you should specialize in one subject or you ll find there is nothing you could do in the future .
