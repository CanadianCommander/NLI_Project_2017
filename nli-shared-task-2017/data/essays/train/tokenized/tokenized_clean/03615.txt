in the past young people helped their family in many activities such as houseworks , in crops and they were very important for the life and the survive of family .they had not the possibility to go to school because there were not much money to do this types of activities .in this conditions they were able to help their communities in different works because they had more time to spend to do this thing .nowadays the rythme of life is changed .life style of youngs is different in compare with the past .they go to school where they do many activities .in the afternoon they do homeworks and usually they do some sport .these activities are only for future or amusement of them .so they can not help community in a good way .for example , in my family we are three children .my brother works all the day , my sister studies and i , for the moment , i am looking for job and so i have a few time to spend for community .in free time i prefer to relaxe .the situation is different from the past because nowadays there are too much things to do .in my opinion , helping community is important for all people but if there are not possibilities to collaborate with members that are in a community , it is right that government helps the society and its member to organize different and interesting activities for all people .
