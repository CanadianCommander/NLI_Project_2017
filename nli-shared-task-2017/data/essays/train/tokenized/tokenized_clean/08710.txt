i absolutely disagree with this statement .why should enjoying life be based on age ?sure , young children have a lot of fun playing around and laughing about simple things and just enjoying mostly everything they do but i also know a lot of older people that still enjoy their life very much .a good example are my grandparents .they are almost 80 years old and are happier than ever .they had to start working really hard when they were teenagers .both of them worked almost all the way up to their 65th birthdays .they have 4 sons together , so you can imagine that it cost a lot of time and work to raise the children .now , the sons are adults and already have families themselves .my grandparents are retired now , so their hard work life is over and they can just enjoy life .their usual day includes long walks through the nature and spending a lot of time with friends and family .they have a nice hobby : bowling .every thuesday afternoon they meet with other people at the same age in a bowling center near their house and just enjoy bowling and talking to good friends .they often come over to my parents  house on the weekends .sometimes the whole family , including all 4 sons and all their grandchildren meets there and we sit together and have coffee and cake .my grandparents have so much they enjoy .last yaer they even made a lifelong dream of them come true , they went on a vacation to the swiss alps .they spent 2 wonderful weeks there .they took tours along the mountains , had a picknick in between a very nice land scenery .after they came back and told us all about the trip we almost got a little jealous .they were so excited and now they are even planning to go back there next year .so you see older people enjoy life just as much as young people , maybe sometimes even more .
