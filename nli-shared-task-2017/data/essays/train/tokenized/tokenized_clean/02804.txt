i support the first openion that having board knowledge of many academic subject is more important than just having specialised in one particular subjest .here is the explaination .first of all if u have board knowledge of many subjects you can easily understand what your university friends are discussing and you can have a feel for that and can add something in their discussion .you will get the advantage of having interaction with many people and you will get many friends which is very necessary to keep a person happy .now let us move to the second point .now-a-days things are happening very differently .things are being connected and the current subjects which are evolving as challenging subjects are the combined subjects like biophysics .so if you want to do research in modern world you must have the knowledge of different subjects .if a person has knowledge of different subjests he will be able to copmpetent in the field of research which is quite interesting in modern world .he will be able to understand what is being discussed in seminars which are not of his field and will able to add his knowledge very much .again the advantages of having knowledge of various subjects is that is will increase general awareness of the person and will help in difficult situations .it will give him confidence to face difficult situations .it will creat an extra effect of the person s personality in his colleague and society .he will get more respect in society .who do nt remember leonardo the vincy ?who is called universal man becuse he was having 16 qualities .he was a good engineer , a good doctor , a good painter , a good mathematician and a good architecterer etc .no body has ever born who has so many qualities .finally if you have board knowledge of different subjects you can guide your children in their career .you may notice from their childhood in which subject they will prove to be good if you have knowledge of the subject .you may help your children in the problems they face while understanding the concept .you may provide them wider knowledge by giving link of the subject with other subject .finally i would say  do nt be a frong in a small well come out of the well and see the world .it is very beautiful  .
