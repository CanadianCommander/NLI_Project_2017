as people who lived long time ago said the best way to travel is hanging alone even though it is risky .i am really disagree about traveling in a group led by a guide for several reasons that are getting a book that is about where you are traveling instead of tour guide and being so relax during the trip insted of depending on someone .in my opinion , is it really hard to get a book that explains everything what you need ?i dont think so it is really hard cause you can get a guidebook from aven simple gas station .for example , there is a movie that is named euro trip is really funny but also it is really educated cause in the movie there was a guy whose name is alex who got all knowledge about historical places in italy .anyway they went to alot of diffrent places in italy and they were themself ovar there because of alex .the important thing is one of the guy who has been working as a guide boy for 10 years was so suprised cause alex knew averything even though he had not been there before .so people can get all knowledge from the books instead of the tour guide .the other important idea acoording to my side is traveling comfortable cause if there are are many people with you , they bother you all time , and also time is not going to be enough cause traveling with everbody is really slow .for example , when i was in istanbul that has alot of historical places , i wanted to visit place that is named topkapi .moreover , i was so angry during the visiting cause everybody was asking a lot of unimportant questions to the tour guide , so i couldnt see all those beautiful places .moreover , i had to change all my trip , retiming my plane , cause of the other people .finally , as my father said if there are many people in the same place , there are gonna be alot of problem in that place .so even though there is no body with me during the trip i am sure i will be so happy alone cause i will do what i want .
