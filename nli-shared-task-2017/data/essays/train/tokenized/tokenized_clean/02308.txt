the conclusion that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , sounds correct to me .there are two arguments that are interesting to consider in evaluating the conclusion above .first , if we assume that colleges and universities are currently using the best strategies and tools to teach students , it is clear that concepts and ideas are fundamental and more important then facts to build the basic knowledge of students .in fact , at engineering universities all the courses in the first couple of years are about algebra , geometry and phisics .all of those courses are about ideas and concepts ; no one of them refers to facts or applications .by learning ideas and concepts , students can develop abilities of reasoning and thinking that in the future they will need to solve real problems and to understand facts .second , it is much more worthwhile studying generalitazion rather then specific applications .in fact , in our real world it is unbelievable to know everything about facts and memorize them .instead , ideas and general concepts can be applied everywhere and help to understand every fact .moreover , our world is running so fast that scientists and researchers discovery every day new thesis and models .if a student knows how to deal with abstract ideas and concept , he or she can easily understand every thing is new and has came up in our world .facts ate constrained by context and circumstances and are very useful to fix and remember ideas and concepts .in conclusion , students must understand firstly ideas and concepts .it is helpful for reasoning and thinking abilities as well as for understanding facts .
