some people argue that when students study , they just learn important facts , and memorize those facts without understanding real meaning that facts have because it is more efficient .however , i completly disagree this opinion because students who learn just facts can not adjust the facts that they learn to different problems , also can not go next level easily , and can not have lots of knoweledge .first , if students learn facts , they can not use those facts for the other situations because they do nt know real concept that facts have .for example , students who learn the facts about the part of american history , the civil war , can know what happened during the war time , and who achieved some important jobs .however , they do nt understand the real meaning of civil war that affected whole american history , and can not find common or different things from the other similrar historical events .second , they will have a difficulty to learn some facts that is hirher level .in the math class , some students just learn the facts about formula of the limit and memorize specific rules .if they meet some higher level problems , or problems that is more complicate , they can not answer .also , if they forget the formula that they learned and memorized , they can not solve the math problems .however , the students who understand concepts and ideas can use their concept for the questions that is higher level .finally , student who understand ideas and concepts can enhance their knowledge and information .knowing facts will be forgotten over time .however , understanding basic concepts and ideas will last over time , and it will be their knoweledge during their life time .therefore , i strongly believe that it is the most important thing to understand concepts and ideas at first for sutdents because it is helpful for understanding the other things and more difficult problems , also earning valuable knoweledge .
