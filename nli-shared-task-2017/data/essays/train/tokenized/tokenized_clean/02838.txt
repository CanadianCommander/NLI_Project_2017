the issue in hand is that , whether the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years .this issue is important because a means of transportation is very crucial in this busy world .the believe that , the use of cars will not reduce in the next twenty years because car is the best way of communication in the present century .i think this opinion of mine is better because travelling from certain distance in car is very comfortable .this is because many people travel in bus as they feel it is more cheaper .but the buses now-a-days are so crowded that it is very difficult for a person to even stand in the bus properly .their transport becomes very tiring and this is the one best reason i feel cars should increase in number in the near future .additionally , i feel that travelling in car reaches us to the destination on time .for example , there was one of my friends who would travel in train from his part-time job to his campus .during winter , due to some problem , the trains have been stopped and later resumed their journey after an hour which made him go late to his college where he had to miss his one hour exam .based on this , i feel that if that person woud have travelled in car , he would have atleast taken a different route which would have made him reach his destination on time .thirdly , i strongly feel that the price of the cars now-a-days are getting cheaper than they were earlier .this will certainly make most of the people to have a car of their own .moreover , many people are preferring to travel in car to any place within their country as they feel it is much more safer and convenient for them .so , these are all the reasons that make me feel that my opinion is the right one .in conclusion , i would finally like to say that the number of cars in use will not reduce in twenty years , but rather they would increase in number .i believe this because cars are the most effective way of transport in this present world and it is very much important for every family to own an individual car .
