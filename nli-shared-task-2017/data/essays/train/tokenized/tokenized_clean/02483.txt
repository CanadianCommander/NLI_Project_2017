i definetely agree with the statement ; in my opinion , ideas and concepts are indeed extremely more important for students than mere facts .in fact , from my personal experience , being a law school student who went through a long school career , the primary scope of learning is getting a real deep idea of the topics and therefore being able to master and criticise them .that has always been my attitude , since the day i started school .in fact my mother , whose profession is teaching , always taught me that the concepts are the most important things for a student .thus , on the other hand , memoryzing facts , dates and names it s completely useless because as time passes , they will soon become confused , unclear , oscure data until they will complete disappear from our mind .there is no use of knowing a date / name if you do nt know what it relates to .on the contrary , as you learn , if you focus on the ideas and the concepts , you wo nt ever forget the essence of any topic .accordingly , in my opinion , only by focusing on the substance of the different topics the students can form themselves with a serious knowledge .ultimately , i think that it s really important for students to think about what they study , to identify the underlying problems that are brought along with every topic and to attempt to form their own opinion about them .only with this attitude , the students will be able to become knowledgeble human beings instead of a group of worthless sheeps that does nt know how to think on its own .
