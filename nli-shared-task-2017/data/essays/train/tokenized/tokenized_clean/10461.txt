in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use and the following will illustrate why .maybe you will find this saying quite odd as nowadays automobiles are found everything , especially in city like hong kong .however , due to the decrease population rate and the increase elderly and death rate , such scenario can be easily understood .with the low birth rate and the high death rate , in twenty years time , it is believed that the world s population will be decreased by forty percent .wiith such low population , the demand for automobiles will definitely decrease and hence by that time , fewer cars will be found .pollutants caused by cars are another example that will support such saying .according to a research , it is estimated that pollutant and other toxic gases exhausted from the cars are three times as harmful as breathing in smog directly .in order to control the problem of air pollution , many countries will eventually impose heavy taxes on cars , or to certain extent , ban the use of car .hence , in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use .the rise of oil prices and other economic factors are also the reasons for the reduce in the use of cars in twenty years times .as you may observe , the oil prices have been fluctuating rapidly , together with the adverse economic factors such as high unemployment rate , many car users will find it relatively expensive and risky in using cars , causing the decrease in number of cars in uses in the long run .last but not least , improvement in technology will also reduce the number of cars in use .we all know that cars can narrow the distance bepeople and improve communications , increasing the interactions between people so as to make a better society .however , with the improvement in technology , such means are nt essential .for example , with the rise of the internet , we can commmunicate easily and need not to drive our cars to see each other .besides , with the improvement in technology , maybe within twenty years time , inventions such as travelling machine will be invented , making cars being redundant .all these can explain why there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
