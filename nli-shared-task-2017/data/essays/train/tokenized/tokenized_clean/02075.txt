there are many different forms of marketing and maybe the most efficient and widely-used form of it is advertising .however sometimes companies make their products seem a lot better than they really are in their advertisements and there are certain reasons for this .first of all , companies advertise their products in order to increase their sales or market shares .while doing so , some companies do not hesitate to do whatever it takes although this may include misinforming the consumers .for instance , many companies generally prefer to hide some certain aspects of their products or the facts about it when they are advertising this particular products .everyday we see millions of these advertisements telling how cheap a product is .but , how many of them state the actual price ?besides , yes the product may be cheap , but compared with what ?secondly , other than hiding some facts about it , companies follow another way to create a more favorable image of their products in the minds of the consumers .they simply utilize impact of media .for instance , the tvs are a very good way to make your product seem ` better` .the visual impressiveness of this media channel is amazing .therefore by making tv advertisements that are enriched with visual impressions might boost your sales .also you can use the effectiveness of celebrities for example .the advice of a well-known pop star might create an incredibly favorable image of your product .finally , by merely advertising your product you can easily create a more favorable image of it .you do not need to hide any facts or utilize visual effects , bright colors in the advertisements to make people believe that your product is better .this is because when people see the advertisement of your product - say , on tv - they ca nt help thinking that it really is a product of high quality .this is maybe because advertising is a heavily expensive thing to do .therefore there is this common fallacy that what is advertised must really be good .to conclude , today s market conditions require the companies to be competent .some companies concieve this as a legitimization of unfair competition and behave in ways that they create misconceptions in consumers  minds .especially when they are advertizing their products .however if they want to create brand-loyal customers they should firstly earn their trust .
