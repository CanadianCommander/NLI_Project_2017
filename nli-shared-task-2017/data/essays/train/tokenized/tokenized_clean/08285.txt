things in life are usually not black or white .it is difficult to say if it s better to work on having a broad knowledge on many different academic subjects or to put that same amount of effort on specializing on an specific field .in my opinion it all depends on the short term objectives of the student which is , after all , closely related to the age .for young age students who are in school , high-school or even in the first years of university , studying a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects will probably be more suitable .diversity is basic in these stages for various reasons .first of all , students need to obtain certain level of general culture , what includes history , geography , maths , literature , grammar , sciences . ..it also needs to be taken into account that some subjects interact with each other .someone ca nt study physics with no math knowledge , so a variety of fields need to be covered .finally , it is also important for young students to become familiar with a variety of fields so that they can choose what they would like to specialize on in the future : it would nt be sensible to let a ten year old chose if he wants to study only biology f just because he likes that particular subject at that stage , for example .they need to have a global vision before deciding what the like , and the way of obtaining it is simply studying a broad syllabus .however when considering adult students , priorities obviously change .for people in their late university years or in graduate courses specializing in a particular subject is basic .the most important reason is that companies require specialists to cover job positions .companies are not usually interested in people who only know a little bit about lots of subjects .they look for indivuduals who are proficient and have a deep knowledge and understanding of specific fields and industries .if the candidate additionally has a broad knoowledge of other things it can then be considered as a plus , but the first characteristic is that he/she is a specialist in a particular subject .as a conclusion it could be said that the age of the student is the best indicator to determine whether it is more suitable to study a broad selection of subjects or to focus all the effort in an specific field .
