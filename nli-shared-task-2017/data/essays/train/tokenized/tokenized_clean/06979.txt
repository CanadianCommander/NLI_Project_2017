generally speaking , i agree that it s more important for students to understand concepts than to learn facts .however , both studying methods present advantages and disadvantages .first of all , though memorization has the advantage of requiring less concentration and less effort from the student , it s more likely to forget what you learnt by heart after a short time .on the other hand , though understanding ideas in depth takes a longer time and implies more effort from the student , it is easier to remember the concepts you adequately understood , and to relate them to your background knowledge .for example , when i study maths , i realise that i ca nt simply memorize information , and that i really have to understand every detail in depth .on the other hand , i admit that sometimes it might also be useful to learn facts by heart .for instance , when i study history , it often happens to remember historical events according to the chronological order they occured .in this case , i think that it s not necessary to spend time trying to understand ideas , as i am just expacted to learn a list of events by heart .thus , though i really prefer to understand ideas , i think that my position is between these two extremes .in fact , i choose my approach according to the subject i am studying .when dealing with a scientific subject like maths , i prefer to understand every detail in depth , as this is necessary to solve exercises and to be adequaltely prepared .on the other hand , when i am just expacted to memorize information , i prefer to learn facts by heart .for these reasons , i believe that my approach to studying is between these to extreme methods .
