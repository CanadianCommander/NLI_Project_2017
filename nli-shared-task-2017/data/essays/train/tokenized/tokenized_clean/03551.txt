when faced to the questions that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , different people had disaparate views for that .in my poit of view , i agreed the view that successful people should try various and new things and take many risks .here i will explore some significant and conspicious reasons as follows :the first reason to support my opnion is that in oder to make big contributions to the society where we live and as the pregress of the society , more and more things needs people who have higher skills and excellent abillities to do the tought staffs .therefore , people should face this situtuation and try their best to do the this as good as he/she can , especially , for those successful people .they shoud adapt the new environment and at the same time , the successful people should try thier best to concentrate on some new tecnologies , such as knowing the skills of how to do well about computers .what is worth noticing that trying new and creative things can help people to improve their characteristics , especially it is good for people to become brave .for example , masier is one of the famous artists in the art fieds , and he is very famous for the harmony art .at the begining , he can not find the key elements of art , but he did not give up it .after taking risks about art and hard working again and agian , finally , he becomes a very excellent artist in the art field .another reason is that trying new things can make people more hard working on the thigs what you concentrate on .the process will let people not easily to say give up and try their best to do well for thier things and this will provide a big chace for them to find aa good job and become succeful in the end .in conclusion , i agree that the successful people should try nem things and take risks rather only doing what they already know how to do well .
