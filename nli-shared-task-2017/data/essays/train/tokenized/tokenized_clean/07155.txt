i completely agree with this issue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i believe there are some reasons about it .young people can be more interested in many things than older people .young people are likely to be able to do more active sports such as baseball , soccer , tennis , runnning , swimming ; on the contrary , older people are likely not to be able to do them .young people are likely to have stronger bodies than older people .moreover , young people are likely to get more new abilities than older people , and young people are nt likely to forget them .in addition , young people are more hopefull than older people .yong people have many choices for their future .they can easily find the way their life go .people make many friends and look for their partner when they are young .thus , young people are likely to be able to enjoy their life more than older people because of these reasons .however , despite of the reasons , it s important for both young and older people to make effort to enjoy their life and hope to be happier than now .
