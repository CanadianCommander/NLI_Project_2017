considering the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  you definitly have to consider the aspects of money .to own a car and to drive it frequently is already quite expensive and people are always complaining about high petrol prices , in addition to that it seems that they continue to increasing constantly .therefore it could be possible that some people think about using different ways of transport instead of driving a car .however , in my opinion there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .most of the people that will be allowed to drive cars in 20 years are already living nowadays and they grow up with the comfort of having a car in nearly every familiy .i think if you get once used to cars and all the comforts they provide you will not like to miss them .there is , for example , the independency that a car provides .if you decide to go somewhere , you do not have to look up the schedule of a bus or a train , you do not have to wait untill the tain leaves or search for a possibility how to get to the trainstation .if you have got a car you can just go outdoors take your key and get away .moreover the car is very practical if you want to get to a place without wasting lots of time .by car you can go more directly , because there are more streets and roads available than ways for a train , and therefore it is possible to save time .to save time is one aspect that seems to be quit important in modern times .you can easily observe this if you count how often people mention the sentence `` time is money  .in conclusion i would say that people will not give up their cars the only aspects when cars will probably be used less than nowadys is for long journeys .i think therefore people will use flights more frequently .
