nowadays many people dream to be a ` succesful person  in his or her society .in my oppinion those succesful people try to express something they already know well rather than try new things .that is why i disagree with the statement saying ` succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .most of success comes from doing something you already know such as drilling oil , developing upon something somebody already made , and having comfortable family .idea of drilling oil and selling them existed since the industrial revolution in england .however , people drilling oil are still one of the richest people in the world .my friend sanjar s dad was just a high ranked government officer in small country called uzbekistan .when his dad started to own a oil drilling business .now his dad drives mercedes , owns summer house in 4 different countries , and gives his some 100 dallars a day .another example of getting rich without trying the new thing is developing upon something someone already acomplished .in this way you can just pick up an idea of someone else , modify it and sell them .for instance , ipod , one of the most famous mp3 player brand just copied off an idea of one south korean company .all they did was add bigger memory and create new attractive design .last exmaple of being succesful people is people with happy family .creating happy family and managing well existed for centuries .yet they are not admired by some people it is very hard to acomphish and it is very pleasant to acomplish .i can say people like my dad have very succeful life since he never divorced or never have kids that smoke or drink .eventough , who is succesful or not can be differ from person to person .i believe most people who have succesful life are people who held on to their knowledge and skills they have rather than try whole new idea .
