to say that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  is a lot like saying that someone should be good in everything but be perfect in nothing .does that make any sens ?everyone should have something they wish to know better . ..that s why we all have different jobs .i think we can find a perfect example of having to really know something in particular , in nipponic society .japan is famous for their experts and we have been trying to copy their way of studying for decades .does the fact that they know more about one subject in particular , make them less smarter than people who know something about everything ?i think not .of course , having a good cultural background is important , but as long as we follow our desires and believe in the things we do , than there s nothing wrong about neglecting other subjects .obviously , this does not apply in an academic enviorment .as long as we are in school , we must study every required subject , but once that s over , we should be free to expand our own knoledge in the fields we prefer .if we all knew the same things , we could never teach each other anything !
