i totally agree the statmentyoung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .i will evaluate with the following paragraphs .before i tell you my reasons , i state that what is mean by ` helping communities  .for me it is working in society in your own time by free which means volunteer .first of all nowadays young people have a lot of things to do in school .for example a small test everyday , big exam onece a month and leaving certificate for end of the school which is really important for the colleage .what i mean is the young people must study for them and which takes enough a lot of time .hence it is difficult to have time for comminties .the second reason is there is so many ways to having fun at the weekend .in the past there were no prikura machinne ( taking pictures of yourself and freinds. ) , shopping , game center and disco .they are very popular for young people .hence they are much prefer to do them instead of helping comunties .also in my opinion young people have an imagie for community which is too hard .they care more about their fashion , the points in school , celeblities , gosships and all .they never interested in the real societies .as you can see the society and people has been cahnged .in other words young people have things to do for themselves .although i know that they are selfish and ridiculous opinions but that is why i beleive young people nowdays do not give enough yimr y
