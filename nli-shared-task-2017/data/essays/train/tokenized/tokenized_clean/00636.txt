i feel that it is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know how to do well .if it were nt for people ready and eager to try new things , or ways to do things , they would never discover that there were better ways to do them .some ways may be time consuming and a waste of energy , but successful people find a way to bypass the waste , and get to their goals in a shorter , more efficient way .imagine someone plodding along the old path going around a mountain overtaking someone who has risked going over the mountain , or perhaps even going through the mountain !it seems highly unlikely !risks and new things lead to better production and better outcomes .if we had nt had people willing to risk a new method of crop raising , or use of pesticides , we would nt have the increased quantities of grains that we do today .their success in trying something new has led to an outcome beneficial not only to themselves , but to all of mankind .this thirst for new ways in successful people has resulted in the discovery of new medicines , test tube babies , forays into space .it has resulted in the creation of industrial giants .a famous company in india , reliance industries limited , has its roots in a tea stall .the late owner used to run a tea stall in a small town .due to his vision and his dare to dream big and try a new way of refining petroleum to create useful by products , dhirubhai ambani ( the late owner of reliance ) was extermely influential and rich and famous by the time he passed awy two years earlier .it is because of his very will to do new things that the company is now one of the most formidable in present times , so much so that it can topple or raise the stock market by the way it moves in the day s trade .if it were nt for the dare of successful people to be different , to try something new , they would nt be where they are today .i hardly imagine that dhirubhai ambani would have been anything but a tea stall owner if he had nt dared to try his hand at something new .
