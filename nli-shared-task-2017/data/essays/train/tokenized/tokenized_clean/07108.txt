in my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .a general concept or idea is made of facts , which are statements found in textbooks or encyclopedias .nevertheless , it is clear to me that the importance of facts ca nt be decreased , because in certain fields of study such as history , facts are extremely relevant .but in most fields of study , without a general understanding of the concept , facts appear worthless .on one hand , concepts and ideas have an importance that ca nt be diminished , because those are the elements that will help one to learn the facts .without understanding the concept or the idea , a student will not be able to learn but more importantly to remember for a long period of time the facts related to the concept or idea .for example , in an astronomy class , the concept of how the planets evolve is more important to understand than to know the exact figures or paths constituting the planet s movement .on the other hand , concepts and ideas are what help a student in his future professional life .the facts can easily be found again in a textbook , on the internet or in any database .but if the concept made by these facts is not understood , the student will not be able to use the facts properly .for instance , a law student , as myself , has to learn a lot of facts and regulations .however , those facts or rules wo nt be useful if the concept is not understood .when , in the future , this law student who became a lawyer is confronted to a tough case , the general idea of how the law regulates on that matter will help him solve the case , whereas the only regulation , if not understood , wo nt .in that example , the everyday life of a lawyer proves the importance of the concept because facts or regulation can be found easily .in conclusion , general ideas or concepts are the essential part of what should be known and understood by every student .however , what makes a student excellent is to both understand the concept and learn the facts .
