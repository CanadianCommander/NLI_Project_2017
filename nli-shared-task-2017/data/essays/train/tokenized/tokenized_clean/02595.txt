since ever there are dicussions if young people enjoy life more than older people do .i would say that this is not true .if i look at my parents or even at my grandparents i can recognize that they still enjoy their life .fist of all , it is clear that older people enjoy their life in a more different way than younger people do .they do not want to go out every night or weekend .but for them this is not so important .they had the possiblities when they were young .for them it is more important to spent as much time with their family as possible .this is enjoying life for them .moreover older peolpe have much more things to do every day .they have the responsibility for a house , they have a job to do , and many other things .when you are young you do not have all these problems or jobes to handle with .so from the eyes of young people our parents life might be seen as not too excited .but i would say that is is not true , too .for older people the things mentioned above are very important .they are pround of all these things and reaching is a way enjoying their life .another point i want to mention is that older people have made much more experiance in their life .most of the thinks me and my friends are doing now my parents have already done .so they enjoyed their life as they were young nearly in the same way as my generation does it now .so you never can not say that they do not enjoy their life .they enjoyed their life as well as we do it now .but unfortunatelly this most of the younger people will understand when they get older .to come to a conclusion , i would never say that younger peolpe enjoy their life more than older peolpe do .as you can read above i completly disagree with this statement .
