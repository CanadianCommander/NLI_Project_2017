students can learn facts , but not necessarily understand them .it is essential for any student to comprehend concepts in order to take advantage of what he or she has understood .learning facts might be useful if students understand and know to apply them .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .a student who understands an idea is able to use it and put it into practice because he or she masters it .for instance , understanding how temperature affects gas expansion will allow students to know when it is a good time to fill a car wheel with air .however , if a student simply learns that higher temperatures tend to expand a gas , this concept will only be general knowledge and probably not useful for him or her .in other words , understandingwhen a student understands , he or she is expanding his or her knowledge as well .although learning facts also expands our views of the world , understanding is a far-reaching tool that might be benefitial to achieve good goals .understanding might help students in using ideas and concepts to solve real-life problems .for example , imaging someone having problems taking out the grease of the dishes with only water .if that person understnads the effect of soap in water , he or she will go and use soap .likewise , understanding ideas and concepts helps students to be more creative .students who have understood something are likely to look for new ways to apply to knowledge gained .for instance , understandingconsequently , it is very important to understand ideas and concepts in order for them to be useful .just learning facts has probably a negative impact on students because it only augments the knowledge the person has , and does not help him or her at all .
