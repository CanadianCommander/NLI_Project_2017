travelling by a tour guide or alone ?some people prefer the former while others prefer the latter .to each his own .however i am a person who likes to travel alone , therefore i am disagree with the statement for the reasons below .first of all , in these kind of tours , the guides usually give general or most interesting information - according to them of course - and do not state details which i may like .therefore i like to have my own books about this certain places and travel with them and read detailed information which are interesting for ` me` .for instance , while i was travelling around the western europe , i had these books which gave me extremely sufficent information about the places i have seen .secondly , you can take your time when you are travelling alone , however you do not have opportunity to spend your time efficiently when you are travelling by a tour guide .therefore you usually do not have time to examine the places that you travel , moreover you do not feel them since there is pressure of the guide because they just want to finish the tour and get their money as soon as possible .for example , in the same trip i mentioned before , i had an experience like that .the guide finished 30 minute tour in 10 minute , using the hot weather excuse and then i never attemped to go a trip by a guide .last but not the least , by travelling on your own , you have the flexibility of choosing places which you do not have if you take a all included trip .so you would not face to travel all over the places which you do not like or even hate .because it is waste of time and money .trerefore spending your energy for the places that you like is more sensible .to sum up , people who like to gain general information and like to see most interestingly claimed places in a time like blinking your eyes , should prefer guide tours .however i prefer travelling alone because of the flexibility of time and possibility of choosing place and the detailed information .
