fact is reality and people have to face the reality no matter how high education you are , reality still can beat you down so easily .there is always something to learn from facts .for example , indepentent , raise a family . ..etc , these stuffs you ca nt learn from books or tv and just understanding the idea and concept of it .learning from facts is much helpfull than just understand ideas and conpects .just learning concept and idea of one thing , it can help you to understand how it works but it ca nt let you really know how to  make  it works , like doing laudry , everyone know how to do laudry just throws all the clothes into the washing machine that s the idea of doing laudry but in fact there are many kinds of clothes that you have to wash and do you know this kind of cloth can put in dryer and which one ca nt ? .too many things we have to learn from the facts not just showing understanding on ideas and concepts .abroading to other country is a great example of this topic .when i was still in taiwan i asked so many people how is your feeling about studying in other country or what do we have to be aware and notice , suddenly i realize the ideas of abroading to other country to study what will everything goanna be and i was nt scared .but when i really came to america and study , everything is different than what i thought .so i realize everything can  t learn from ideas and concepts , we have to learn from the facts .gradually i get used to this life and after i went back to taiwan , some people asked my what do i have to notice when i go to other country to study .i just answer :  you will figure it out , it wo nt help you if i just tell you the sistuation will be  .again !i emphasize facts are much more important than understanding ideas and concepts .let s make a conclusion here , understanding ideas and concepts only occupy 1 % but learning from facts it has 99 % .
