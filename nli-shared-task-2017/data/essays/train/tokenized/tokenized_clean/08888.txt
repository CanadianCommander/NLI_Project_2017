do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?personally , i do nt think so , even if it s quite difficult to know how much one enjoys life .i do nt see specific reasons why young people would enjoy life more .one could argue that their physical abilities are at their maximum , but in our modern societies , older people do nt necessarily suffer from health problems , and physical abilities are not the only sources of happiness .i think some people enjoyed life more while being young , and others prefer life ` now  , that is , while being older .an idea widely spread is that being twenty years old is the best time in life , but the famous french writer paul nizan said he would never allow anyone to say such a thing .this shows that it really depends on people .furthermore , it is not because one would like to be younger that he enjoyed life more at that time .this can be explained by the fact that he would like to be younger , but also to know what he knows now .alas , if young people knew , if older people could !the kind of enjoyment is simply different , depending on the age of people .maybe young people enjoy it more obviously , or , may i say , noisily : they want to make this known .but people get - generally - wiser as time goes by , can enjoy other aspects of life , and are not concerned anymore by problems that , now they know it , are minor .to conclude , i would say that this general statement - young people enjoy life more than older people do - is untrue .this depends mainly on people , and the wise man can enjoy differently each period of his life .
