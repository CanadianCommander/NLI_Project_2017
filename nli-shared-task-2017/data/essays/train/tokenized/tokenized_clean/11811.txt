i do not agree with the statement .that is one-sided and not considering the meaning of what is really to `` enjoy  .young people seems that they are more energetic and full of hopes and potentials .their interests might be focus only on future .in a way self-centered .to them , life seems going forever and ever and never ends .they are enjoying youth .not life .some of the younger people , they have nt even lived yet .also , life does not always go as you wish or planed .when you re younger , you do nt have much patience and it seems frustating .we do nt live alone , noone does .life means including all other people comes in our lives .as we get older , we realize that .when you focus on only the future and yourself , how can you appreciate and enjoy ?i like the old saying : stop and smell the roses .surely the future would be always there no matter how old you become but your priority shifts as you get older .but as you get older you realize what s matters in life .people who once realize the priority , more likely to enjoy life .in most cases it s the freinds and family in your life because they are the ones you ca nt live without .also as you get older you realize what is the quality of life .in younger days , you would think youth would be there forever then once day you realize that is not true .i also believe it take some maturity to enjoy life itself .i know some older people who are retired and not much so called excitement in life going on like younger people but they seems happier and more satisfied of their lives .everytime i ask them if they are happy , the answer is always yes .you d be wonder why or how can they , old and boring but they are happy with themselves and knowing what they have accomplished .they are pretty much content with what they went through and gained some confidence from it .so therefore , i do not agree with the statement .it takes some time until you make peace with yourself and your own life .older people enjoy life more than the younger people .
