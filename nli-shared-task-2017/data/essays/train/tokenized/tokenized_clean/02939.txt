although much people may agree with this statement i disagree with it for several reasons .the first point is that there are no reasons to support this statement .why should an older person enjoy life less than younger people ?older humans have the same possibilities to enjoy life as younger do .they are able to go shopping , to go to cinema or whatever they want .furthermore i may say that older people enjoy life more than younger do because generally they have more money and know exactly what they want .because i am young i have to try out what i like and what i dislike .for example , if i travel to austria and after the first three days i realize that i do not like this country .in this situation the whole holiday will be bad .if i had been older , i would have known that and would not been traveled there .it is also the fact that older people are having more pastime when they are free from working .so they have much more time to do what they want .due to this they would enjoy their life more than younger people which still have duties like going to school or working .moreover , younger people are stressed more often because they want to have success in their jobs or in school .so , even if there is time to do something enjoyable , they just will not do this because they are too stressed .the third reason why i disagree with this statement is because of my own experiences .nearly all the older people i know are enjoying their life very much .my mother is an example for that .since she is older than fifty , she is more often in bars and clubs than i am .she also has many friends and enough money to do whatever she wants .my last point deals with the danger of deseases in age .i do not think that this fact consequently prevents older people from enjoying their life .in my opinion , knowing that life is short and may also end in the next years is an argument for enjoying life .in that situation people perhaps will care about their time and use it as well as possible .in the end i think that older people may enjoy their life even more than younger people do .
