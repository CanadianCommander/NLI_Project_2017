i disagree with this statement because even if old people are nt healthy anymore they can do a lot of things and have as much fun as younger people have in their lifes .the first reason for my opinion is that not all old people are so weak and ill that they only can lie in bed .and even if they ca nt to sports anymore or maybe ca nt walk at all they can do other things that bring a lot of fun to them .for example they can learn something in courses especially offered for older ones or they can read amazing books or looking good films .another reason why i think that old people can have a lot of fun is that they have much more time than young people have , because of not beeing forced to go to work eight or ten hours every day .because of that they only have freetime , and can spend it with their family , or travel in foreign countries for example .finally old people can have maybe even more fun than younger ones because of their increased level of experience .the long time old people have already been on earth causes they have a lot more knowlegde about how things work in life .they connected a wide range of different charakters , solved a lot of problems and so learned much about themselves .so old people know enough what kind of activities they enjoy and what kind of people they like .with that knowledge most things are easier and cause less trouble .for example a weekend trip makes more fun if you re in a group you fit in .in conclusion experience and a lot of free time let have old people have a lot of fun , even if their ill .they just have to visit groups or courses for old people or spending their time together with friends or their family by doing things they enjoy .
