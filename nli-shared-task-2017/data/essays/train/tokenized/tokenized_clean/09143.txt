knowing ideas and concepts form techniques to understand a subject or topic .facts are true statements about the subject or topic .when it comes to deciding which of these are better for indepth knowledge of a subject or topic , then i completely agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .my opinion is influenced by certain factors which include ; need to analyse a topic to learn better , better rememberance of facts and having a grip on the topic so that new facts can be easily understood .when we think of learning , the first thing that comes to mind is how to understand the contents .to understand the subject , we need to analyse its contents .for example , we are dealing with a fact that all matter is made up of atoms .its very simple statement , but we must understand why it is so to appreciate the fact stated .here comes the requirement for analysis .as we analyse the topic , we could also understand the need for stating this , which could be that we are studying the structure of some material say benzene .next we need to remember some facts of a subject .the example quoted earlier was a simple logical fact .but , some complex facts like the einstein s theory of relativity is not very easy to remember .it needs understanding of the content to memorize the fact .without a proper understanding of the concepts involved which made the scientist to propose the theory , it is just impossible to remember the fact propose as it is very complex .lastly , when we are learning something , it should not be mere memorizing of the facts stated , but , it should be a concrete base for furthur developmental study .in simpler words , learning something should be like a foundation to a building .the building could be a research or knowing newer facts to be understood .suppose , while experimenting , we make an observation , then without a understanding the idea of conducting the experiment and concepts included in the processes involved in it , we will not be able to conclude from the experiment .so , even to state a fact , understanding of ideas and concepts is imperative .in short , understanding of ideas and concepts will help us analyse the facts presented to us .besides , it also enables us to memorize the facts and other contents of the subject .finally and most important of all these is that , without a proper understanding of the ideas and concepts , we will neither be able to understand nor conclude anything .so , understanding enables better learning that mere knowing of facts .
