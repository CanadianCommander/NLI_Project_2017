i ca nt make a clear decision wether i agree the statement or not , because it depends on the product and especially on the brand .i think that products and brands being popular and well known wo nt cheat with their advertisment .one reason is that the quality of most of this products is so high that there is no need for the enterprises to lie .a second reason is that the enterprises harm their image if they promise something their product ca nt fulfill .but on the other side new or unknown brands which will conquer a market ca nt survive if they wo nt get humans attention .that s why many enterprises have to make big promises to attract the consumers view .examples can be seen daily in tv or in the written media .in our days i think i tend a bit more to the fact that i wo nt agree with the statement .in the time of internet there is a high transparancy concerning the quality of goods .statements of people who used the product could be looked up and so if one product has bad critics the enterprise could be kicked out of business .furthermore there are several institutions like the german `` stiftung warentest  which test products to give a neutral statement , and people give much upon their opinion .last but not least the legal situation for businesses is more difficult .so there is only a small path between what is legal exageration and what is illegal cheating .so the risk to harm the business , for an enterprise , is big enough that most of them wo nt make their products better than they realy are because there is a lot of danger in being punished by the state or even the consumers .
