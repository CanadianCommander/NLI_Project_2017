i am now 20 years old .older people would say i am very young to understand the society as an adult .younger people would say i am enough old to go out of family and experience the world .in the year 2006 , many things happened to me .i went to the united states of america for the first time , and have been a student in a college .i had to experience everything in a foreign language , english .imagine , it still might have been hard if i was a student in my country , but i had to do in a foreign country .it gave me new experiences in my life .i had to make my decisions by my own .my family and my friends were too far from me to give advise .it was a hard year for me .so younger people enjoy their life more than older people do .young people might feel the world and think in their own ways but they still stay in a particular places like house , school or by their friends .they would also do nt know exatly what is happening in the world , what they do everyday is playing , hanging out with their friends and do their duty as children in their family .when they grow up and become old people , they might have many things to consider in their lifes .they have to consider about money problems , have to consider about their children , have to think about their future and so on .also they will find out that the world is not so easy to live than they were expected when they were children .in conclusion , younger people will enjoy more their life than older people do , because they have less things to care about and does not know how hard the world is to live as a human beings .
