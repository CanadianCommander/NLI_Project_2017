in the modern economy , characterized by the progressive saturization of the markets in each business area , it becomes more and more strategic for farms the use of advertising through the mass media ( television in particular ) .but often , in order to stimolate consumers  desires , advertisements seem to overextimate the real potentiality of products .that assumption is more than that .it s a concrete reality .in fact in the last decade public institutions had been created to control product advertising and to state if the picture offered by advertisements really reflects the product characteristics .the creation of such institutions points out that in order to improve the sails of a product , it s much more important the immage the farm gives to the market of it than its real technical characteristic .for that reason often consumers prefere buying a well-known product than an un-known one , even if it has much more better technical qualities .an important example of that phenomenon occured in the car builders sector few yars ago .two important groups , audi on one side and saab on the other one , decided to improve a project for a new car togheter .i particular , in order to cut down the costs associated to its production , they shared the same motor and also the same structure of the car .so the two cars had the same performance as reguard for speed , control and other technical parametres , but were a little bit different in the hestetic ( not too much ) .well , even if this two cars were so similar , audi sold millions of unit more than saab did .and why did it succede in doing that ?only because , thanks to a better comunication and advertisement to the market , it had maden people able to believe in the superiority of its product and in the reliability of audi brand .but lots of other examples can be shown in all the business area : products pictured as innovative , sure and unbreakle are only common products that you can buy with ease ( and sometimes at lower price ) from another farm operating in the same area .finally , looking at those and lots of other examples , i completely agree with the statement presented and i want you all to meditate on such a misrappresantation .
