i think everyone knows about the story of a ` giving tree .it s a story about how a tree gives everything to a boy whom the tree loves .the tree starts with giving the boy a shade made by the leaves of the tree by giving everything the tree got - leaves , fruits , branches , a trunk - the tree ends up with nothing but a place for the boy to sit and rest .this story shows us how touching and beautiful it is to sacrifice oneself and help others .but this story , is just a story and what we call the ` valuable sacifice  ca nt be seen anymore .thus i agree to the statement that says young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree because the modernization made people too much individualized that they only think about themselves and also because people do nothing that gives them nothing in return .this week on monday , i happened to read an article talking about a highschool student being qualified to enter hanyang university because he spent much time helping his community .this clearly prooves that there are not much voluntary work being done these days .the lack of voluntary works are so lacking and are in need that it the abundant voluntary works that the student has done made him enter the college wihtout any other requirements .i believe that the modernization has the responsibilty for this phenomenon .as the community society was being divided and many people left to larger cities to earn more money , people have been less socializied and are too much individualized .people do nt mingle with their community members anymore as much as they did in the old days , which made them forget how to cooperate and live together .people are greedier than they were before .they want rewards and returns for the investment they have made .for example , in may this year , the principal of my school announced that extra point will be given to those who spends time doing voluntary works in their communities .after this announcement has been made , students went crazy to do voluntary works to get more points .statistics showed that 5students doing voluntary work increased to 16students per month in only for months .so to say , i strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i thinks the government should bring up new polices to encourage students and other community members to participate in voluntary works .
