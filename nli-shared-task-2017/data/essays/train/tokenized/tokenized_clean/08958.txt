contrary as it might sound there are a number of reasons and phenomena that are happening around the world that may indicate the number of cars in use will drop in the next twenty years .this may sound counterintutive as the automobile market is booming and car sales are higher than ever before .however a closer look at the issue reveals a slightly different picture .firstly there is the global oil crisis that has affected almost every nook and cranny of the world .in most countries it has become exorbitant to fuel a car that is being used regularly .general environmental awareness levels are also going up .now more than ever before people world over are realising how much automobile exhaust is polluting the atmosphere .this in addition to oil shortage will eventually discourage people from investing in cars .furthermore mineral resources and metal mines are not endless .very soon they will run out at the current rate of utilisation .once this happens the prizes of cars will sky rocket .so far there have been very few cars that effectively run on non-polluting safe energy .even the few that have developed have not managed to capture the general market .secondly most countries are going to great lengths to develop efficient , and fast public transport systems .in addition most cities are expanding .as the city limits become larger and larger people have to commute greater distances to get to the destination of their choice .thus as public transport systems become better and more widespread people will soon realise that it is definitely more economical to switch to public transport rather than to use cars .lastly another global proble , seemingly mundane but actually crucial is the increase in incidence of road congestion and the lack of parking space .most cities now days suffer from terrible and atrocious traffic jams which uneccesarily waste time .even if you escape a traffic jam you may have to go to elaborate length to find a free parking spot .in conclusion it can be seen that eventually all of the above factors , to varying extent will discourage people from buying more cars .thus as older cars slowly fall into disuse the number of cars totally in use will go down in the next twenty years .
