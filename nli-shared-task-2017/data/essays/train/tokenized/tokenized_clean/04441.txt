the numbers of the cars increase everyday .people who do not have cars buy cars .this will be controversial situation in future , the number of cars in twenty years will increase or not .too much cars will cause traffic problem , people will not go their jobs on their time .in my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by the improvements in new transportation systems .in future , the underground transportation system is going to improve , as the construction technology is improving .it is going to be easier to build new tunnels for the subway in every part of the city .the number of the subway station will increase in future .as a result , people can travel easily around the city .for example , in one station there will be five or more lines , which will have different directions .in cities , people prefer to use subways without having park problems , traffic jams , taxes .also , the resources of petreloum is decreasing everyday , so prices are increasing and cars become expensive transportation vehicles .second reason for not using the cars is going to be the scooters .as the improvements made in the electricity engines are applied on the scooters .for example , the segate scooter was started to sell in market and people interested in .in twenty years people will be using scooters instead of cars .third tranportation vehicle is plane which causes in the fall of the cars in twenty years .as the technology is improving , in future the airplanes will be cheap , easy to fly and small .so , people can buy airplanes .for eaxmples , airplanes will take off from the roof of houses and land on where the people go .also , airplanes will be much more fast than cars .as a result people will travel quickly .to sum up , in future there will be alternatives to transportation with cars .so , people will prefer new tranportation systems which cause a decline on the number of cars in twenty years .
