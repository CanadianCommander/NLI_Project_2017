some educational experts claim that the role of schools and colleges is to teach pupils facts .others believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .i believe that making students understand ideas and concepts is the most important role of education .yet it can not be done without the students learning the facts .understanding ideas and concepts is vital in the world we live in today .technology and sciences are evoluting so fast nowadays that the knowlege of concepts is extremely important .without understanding the ideas and concepts behind these technological advaces , a student will not be able to resilve problems facing him in that area .in fact understanding ideas and concepts offers students the possibility to face any problem in each and every realm of their life .it gives them a certain logic and methodology that widens critical thinking .on the other hand , concepts and ideas are impossible to understand without the learning of facts .the good knowlege of facts made the great inventors and thinkers of history ( leonardo davinci , galileo , albert einstein , louis pasteur . .. )discover and develop new concepts and ideas .facts are to concepts what wheels are to cars .a car can not drive without wheels ; a concept can not be accurate or even invented without the knowlege of the scientific facts .this is why students should be taught the facts .yet their education should not be limited to facts .an education limited to the teaching of facts will produce students with rigid and limited thinking .the facts ought to be the academic package that will allow students to understand the concepts and maybe come up with ideas of their own .
