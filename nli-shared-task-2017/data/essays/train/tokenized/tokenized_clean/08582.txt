at my way of thinking i disagree with the statement because if you are going to sell a product you must show the people the real product not showing something better for only winning money because later passing a few month they are going to see that the product is not the same that the product shown in publicity .my opinion is that if you are going to by a product because you saw it on the television you might be sure that is the same product because later you are going to know that it is not the same and you are paying something that you dont wanted and that is a wasted of money .i know what it feels that because when i was 15 years old i went with my mother to a mall from peru to buy a perfume that it was very expensive , so we think that if the perfume was expensive it was going to be a good product , so we didnt opened and seeif it was good .four month later we found that it wasnt smelling good so my mother knew that she was cheated .the next day we went to the store and say the saller that the perfume wasnt good and the boss told us that the seller who gave us the perfume was a bad persone so the next day they the boss fire him and we recived a new perfume and that was ok .but in the other hand the people who do the marketing they put the product better than the original , so thay can impress the people and they can sell more products but that can bring you bad consecuences becasue then they are going to buy the product and they are going to know that the product you are selling is not the same of the marketing and that persone is going to be a cheater for all his life .other point of view is that when you are in the store and you are aceppting something you must cheak it out in case that it is wrong .the important thing is that if you like a perfume you can buy it but make sure that its the good one .in conclution what im saying is that all the product you have to be carefull what are you going to buy and trying not to go only for a nice product .
