first of all , i would like to refer about the range of `` young people  and `` old people  .i would like to refer `` young people  , as an university students , and `` old people  as those parents .these days , parents , who have sent their children to universities , tend to restart enjoying their own lives .untill high school , a number of parents consider their children as immature .although , as soon as they enter university , they change their idea that their children are no longer immature .therefore , after their children are grown up to university students , parents shift their life for enjoying themselves .in my opinion , i am against to the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , in terms of studying and relationships between friends .firstly , young people , who are in universities , have to study a lot .most of them have lectures everyday , have to make a presentation , or submit reports .on the other hand , old people , have no schools nor lectures .they are totally free to spend their free time .secondly , about relashionships between friends .when people enter universities , the first thing they try to do , is making friends .it can be an enjoyable thing , but in return , it might be a stressful thing .they have to seek for an opportunity to speak to a new person , and get to know each other .although , parents , who have already gained a friend , do not need to make new friends .they do not need to experience those stressful times any more .to give an more considerable instance , my mother enjoys more of her life after my enterance to university .she goes out with her best friend more often , go out with her to see a play , movies , etc .moreover , she is making more time to stay with her husband .they go out for a drive , or take a walk with our dog .from these facts i can maintain that parents are enjoying their life , as much as university students do , in terms of school affairs and relationships between colleagues .as we see parents , as old people , from these two points , we can say that it is true that they are enjoying their life .it might be not an exaggeration to say that old people are enjoying their lives much more than younger people .from these reasons , i am against to the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
