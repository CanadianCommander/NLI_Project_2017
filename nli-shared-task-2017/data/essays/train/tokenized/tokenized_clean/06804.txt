most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i personally agree with this statement because the companies developes advertisements in order to sale and it implies many times lie about the product .the companies developes advertisements in order to sale and it implies , many times , lie about the quality and advantages of this product and the product brings many people who is dissapointed about it .the companies do not aware about the risk of this item because the company could lose many profits and also people could demand them for this .furthermore , the companies which develope the advertisement should have a rule in order to control the quality of product because they could be demanded also for this item .i think that is an ethic problem , the companies should have ethical classes in order to avoid this behavior .many companies have a lot of quality measures in order to avoid this problems , for example , a company which develope make up have a lot of test before the product was saled , this is due to the make up could causes many problems in the skin such as allergy reactions or eruptions .moreover a company which developes medicines must to be very carefull testing the products before the sale .however i think the most of the make up producers lie about the advantages of their products because they have to overrate the product in order to be saled .finally , i think that the customers should demand any time they buy something which is saled as a wonderfull thing and it is not a wonderfull thing because with this measures we can stop the companies which announce the best products and they are not .we should demand also the advertisement companies because they do not have ethical values .
