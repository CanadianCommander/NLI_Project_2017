i m sure i can say i totally agree with the statement .in fact it s the reason why i choose a course of degree that cover a lot of different subjects .i think one simple ( but not so stupid , i suppose ) reason is because studying a lot only one subject can easily become very very boring .i ca nt immagine to pass all the years of the college studying all the aspects and features of the same subjects over and over again .i m sure that this way one will become a great expert of the subject , but i think in the end he could even begin to hate it , unless he is totally fond of it .another good reason to achieve some knowledge in at least more than one subject is that you can never know what life s deserving to you .one question : what if you ca nt find a job that s concerned with that subject you have studied ?it means that you are really unlucky , but it could happen .one extended knowledge in only one subject means that probably you are very little competent in any of the other numberless subjects that exist .with an academic preparation that covers a lot of different subjects , you have at least medium-to-high skills in a greater number of them .so on your curriculum it ll written that you have matched during your academic carreer a number of subjects , meaning you could more easily find a job in a variety of environments ; after all , i think , you can achieve the real expertise in a field of knowledge only with the direct experience on the working place rather than with the academic studies .i think this is true at least for what concerns my biomedical engineering studies , i m sure that the knowledge of chemistry , physics , mathematic , biology and medicine that i m learning , although they re not totally complete will help me in future finding a possible job in a number of biomedical applications .
