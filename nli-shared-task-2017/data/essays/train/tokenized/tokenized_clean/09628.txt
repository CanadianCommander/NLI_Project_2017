some people would think specialize knowledge is the most important , however i prefer to choose the broad knowledge of many academic subject .there are theree reasons for this : to have many information , to have wide view points and to make own new field .first of all , the foundation of our knowledge was decided be the quantity of the imformation .for instance , i major bussiness administration in my university .if i do not study about not only foundamental bussiness theory but also other advertizement theory , i can not know deeply about marketing theory .likethis , bord knowledge is essentioal .secondly , if a persson consentrate on only the specific field , they will not be able to have wide view point .in jeneral speaking , like these kinds of people can not understand other peoples idea so they will have bias thinking way .adding to this , these kinds people like to be minority , so they will have difficult time in their life .finally , in order to make own new field , it is better to have wide knowledge .noneless to say , new theory is made by the combain of the fandamental knowledoge which saomeone have .if a person specialize in a specific problem , there will be limit of them .because , new field is introduced by creative thinking based on the wide information .from these reasons , i think if a person concentrate on the specific field , there are more less potentioal in their future .truly , studying only one subject which a person really want to study is important things .yet , when we think about this problem from long term .clealy , having vast knowledge of many kinds of academic subject is more good for the person s future .
