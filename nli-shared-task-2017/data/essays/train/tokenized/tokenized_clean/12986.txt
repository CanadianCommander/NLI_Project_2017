at the turn of the century , there was a common view that there would be fewer cars in use in a quarter of a century time , which is in twenty years from now .and i still today do not share that view .but , why should the public think the number of cars should decrease over the years is the question i will answer so as to justify my disagreeing with the above statement .let me first evoke the several grounds people resort to when argueing for a prospective slump in the numbers of cars on the streets .increasing concern for the environment coupled with the skyrocketing oil prices seem to push for a general decrease in car onwership .from where i stand , the necessary adjusments will be made so that car ownership stays stable or in the increase , because we should not forget that the survival of a whole industrial branch - the automobile industry - is here at stake , and this sector is ready to adapt to new trends and new requirements from the general public .first , research & development is a field where massive investment currently takes place .auto makers would not develop such extensive research with no prospects for future sales and no return on investment ( roi ) .for example , toyota is investing a lot so as to come up with ever more ecologically-friendly vehicles .plants and labs in india have already combined efforts and launched the toyota prius , a city car that pride itself in being eco-friendly .this is direclty targeted at the market which is conscious about the enviromnent , the eco-friendly share of the population , which cares for ethics and is scrupulous about social responsibility .second , the lack of time and parking space have been two major factors for the redirecting of car owners onto public transportation and bicycles , moppeds etc .but public transportation has its disadvantages ( overcrowded ) , so do bicycles and motorcycles ( hazardous on slippery roads , frequent accidents , uneasy in winter conditions ) .therefore , auto makers have tried to answer that growing need for small cars that enable you to virtually park on any parking spots at almost any time .to support that point , the smart car by mercedes , provides its drivers with the opportunity of parking horizontally to the curve , where no regular size vehicles normally could .last but not least , the increase in the cost of running a vehicle .since 9/11 , the price of the oil barrel has increased three-fold .this means that filling your tank has become a burden on family budget and could turn out to make people refrain from using their car .to counter that factor , innovative solutions are found : brasilians now run their can on sugar cane and sunflower oil .resorting to methanol has been a solution studied by german automakers .it would drastically reduce the cost .hybrid cars with their fuel-efficiency have started to penetrate the market and seduce the expense-sensible families .in the end , it is easy to witness how the market is currently trying to adapt itself to changing trends and growing concerns that may threaten the auto market .by successfully adaptating itself today , the automobile industry is securing its future .
