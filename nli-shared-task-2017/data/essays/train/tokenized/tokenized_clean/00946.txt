i agree to the statement .if you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make changes and reach the top ?of course , being successful means different to everyone .for me , being successful means being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in .a successful businessman is one of the most influential leaders in the field of managing and administrating an enterprise .a successful pianist is one of the most revered musicians and plays the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others .for instance , hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four fingers , is now a successful pianist in korea .her performance may not be as good as mozart ; but the thing is , despite the harsh circumstance , she became one of the prospective pianists in korea .she would not have gained the fame and recognition , had she given up and blamed the situation .the potential to succeed is not born with ; it s all about grabbing as many opportunities as one can and doing things that usual people do not even think about .
