i agree and disagree with the following statement  young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .nowadays , everything is different .if we compare today to two hundred years ago , we will see a lot of differences such as different cultures , people and places .however , children never change .they always have the feeling that they should never work and always play .according to my experiences , i agree more with the following statement than i disagree .young people ( teenagers or children ) do not have the spirit for working or helping on anything .they are mostly attracted to the computer games , movies , soccer , basketball and other things .therefore , it is not their fault that they do not do some things .however , it is their responsiblity to do at least some of the things they have to do .there are also other teenagers or children who are by far different from the people who always play computer games or watch tv programmes .these kind of people ( teenagers or children ) might be as young as other children but might be much more mature than the other .these kind of young people usually give enough time to helping their communities .however , young people not giving enough time to helping their communities might result from the parents .the parents have a big role and effect on the life of the children .if the parents always do what the child wants , then you would not expect that child to give enough time to helping his/her community .if you get the child whatever he/she wants , then he/she will want more and more and you will buy more which will be a very bad influence on the child .for example , i have few extremely rich friends .these people always get what they want .however , they are the ones who usually fail during school .so i think the parents might also effect the children .
