the issue at hand is about the number of cars that will be present in about twenty years from now .i strongly disgree that the number of cars would decrease in the next twenty years .the first reason to support my belief would be the population of the world .the population in this world is increasingly so drastically that there is no question of decrease in the number of cars in any way in the near future .if anything , i think that there will actually be a sharp increase in the number of cars .nowadays having a car of the latest model and technology is a style statement .so much so that teenagers demand really expensive cars from their parents at a very young and impressionable age .on an average every family might have eventually have two cars eventually as the children grow up .i would like to quote a very personal example in this context .my own brother had his own car when he was about eighteen years old , when he entered his undergraduation college .and as generally expected by now he is really `` bored  with his car and wants to change it and consequently my mother has to weekly dispose numerous pamplets of various cars that my brother gets home in order to convince my father to buy him a new car .in my immediate family of about fourteen members ( of which seven are teenagers ) we own about seven cars .exactly half the number of the members of teh family and the family is only going to increase .furthermore , the various advertisements on television and the huge hoardings all over a city successfully entice sybarites .it has been noticed that the richer are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer .the rich indulge themselves and pamper themselves and their family with the most expensive cars and other commodities such as mobiles etc .but one can not deny the convenience associated with owning car .one doesnt have to be dependent on public transport which is time consuming and often makes a person irritable and hence more inclined to the idea of owning a car and dwelling in its luxury .alll this will further enhance an increase in the number of cars in the future .i would like to mention one instance which i think is relevant to the topic .i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine who takes a fancy for one particular car called ` swift  .she told me that the first thing that she will do when she saves sufficient money is to buy that car which she loves .she is not teh only one who dreams about such a thing , there are thousands of people out there who have such plans for their ` future  .currently i am living in a city which is famous rather infamous for its traffic and innumerous cars , attrbuted to the it development in the city and not one day passes by when i dont complain about this fact .recently , while i was reading a local newspaper i came across a survey of the number of cars in teh city and its rapid growth , which predicted an increase in the number of cars and this further strengthens my view on this topic .
