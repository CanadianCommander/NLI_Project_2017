yes , i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .the nature of advertisements is to sell , be it a consumer product or a political message .in order to sell , advertisements often exhibits the following features :first of all , advertisements often create an attractive image associated with the product to their consumers or their audience .advertisements , especially those tv ads with sound and picture , often present the products to consumers in a more appealing way .for example , an advertisement for nextle coffee in china .the tv ad has several handsome young men and elegant young women sipping coffee with a background soundover `` great flavor , great taste !.people in china watched this ad unconsciously have the impression that cool , trendy , handsome people drink coffee .the sales of nextle coffee shot up after the ad .though tea is more popular in china , yet the attractive image presented in the ad lured many tea drinkers to buy nextle coffee .they want to be associated with the trend .in this case , advertisements here add halo effect to the products .secondly , advertisements often use image leader to convey appealing message to their audience .for example , nike s tv ad with michael jordon playing a basket ball accompanying the nike logo and `` just do it  message is very tempting .people feel that wearing nike shoes , they can be more successful .it creats an illusion .because people admire jordon and they want to buy the shoe brand he is wearing .here , jordon is the image leader .people follow suit .people want to identify themselves with famous people .finally , advertisements often only mention the positive things about the products and ignore or downplay the side effects or negative aspects of the produccts .for example , ads for drugs .`` ask your doctor if this medicine is for you  instead of mentioning the side effects .in sum , advertisements are marketing tools .they can not truly reflect what products they are .they often elevate the products .
