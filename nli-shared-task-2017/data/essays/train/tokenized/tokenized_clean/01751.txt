as unfortunate as it may sound , there is no doubt that it is true .`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ,  but why is that ?what has changed in the principles and morals being preached to adolescents over the last decade or more ?in reality nothing has changed , except for today s previously unseen rapid adancement and development in the technology sector of society creating a world of technocratic countries .young people are really the victims of this technology-centered lifestyle , because they are the primary consumers of video games , computers , and listening devices .engulfed in their own world of entertainment , teenagers do nt care anymore about the slums and the sub-standard education that many of their country s citizens are experiencing .today , what s constantly on a teenager s mind is whether or not his parents are going to buy him a playstation for his or her birthday and not what he or she can do to help society .therefore , high-tech advertisement has created a highly capitalist consumer culture , which does not allow for adolescents time to think about their surroundings or world issues .in regard to advertisement , television is its best and most common means of transfer .television as neil postman has said , is gradually corroding our once highly regarded societal values .the discourse of television is quick and entertaining , introducing you to the world s problems in an entertained manner and thereby rendering them as far away dilemmas with no conern what so ever to the person watching .for example , a person might watch a news reel describing the high amount of toxic fumes in his or her area , but they wouldnt do anything about it , because the advertisement following the alleged seriousness of the news cast puts infront of its audience a brand new xbox .now the concern of the teenager is to find ways that could get him or her that xbox .what happened to the toxic fumes story ; it just becomes something he or she heard .technoloogy is quickly eliminating the importance of family and societal values .as a result of globalization it is practically impossible now to hault the growing self-centerdness that is characterizing more children .children are growing up and all they see around them is fun and entertainment , even when one has the urge to turn serious and turn on the news cast all he or she encounters is another form of entertainment .therefore , with entertainment so easily accessable , then it would make sense that teenagers or `` young people  would become engulfed in a bubble world of their own , where the problems of society are nonexistant to them .
