every one on earth has his own ideas that could impress or depress the the environment around him .the presence of these ideas does not cancel the fact that facts are dominant in our world .there is a huge difference between the two concepts and most people get mixed up between the two .ideas are a special state of a person s own inspiration and thoughts like the idea of inventing a time machine while facts are things that remain unchanged for the rest of life like the fact that sun revolves around earth .although the facts are what taking the people s concerns , ideas are more important than facts because from ideas we can reach out facts .one good example of an idea developing into a fact is space rocket .first scientists had an idea of creating a method of transportation that could link us to space .they had the picture of a space rocket and they started to apply that inspiration and thougt to the facilities they had ntill they fullfilled their satisfaction and got the idea of inventing a space rocket to reality tha it became a fact .now it is a fact that we have a method of transportation to the outer space .another good example is the idea of making peace treaties among different countries .although not all countries are on good terms with each other , some worked really hard and succeeded in getting the idea of making peace treaties with others to reality that it became a fact .so that little idea developed into a fact that every one knows about .in conclusion those who really think that facts are more valuable than ideas are mistaken because as presented above we can see that almost all facts we know on earth have developed from small ideas .basically , for one to reach or develop an idea , he must first start with an idea ; he may or mmay not realise that idea but as a matter of fact he could not have reached this fact without having an idea at first .that is mainly how ech minimal fact has reached us today .
