i agree with this statement for many resons .the first one is young people spend their time in other things .the second , they focuse their afforts in other staffes .the last one , they do not have good supports from people to help their communities .first of all , young people spend most of time in activeties belonging to them self not for their community .for example , they spend time in playing , visiting friends , studying and help each others .secondly , they focuse their afforts in things which it give the benefits for them .for example , young people may do some works with very hard work if they get money or at least a littel gift which it unforchintly does not happen often in communities .thirdly , they may not have good support to that nither from school or home .the reson is the school and home - speacily home - told them to do some things belonging to them or make benefits for them without thinking in socity .i think young people will do some scoity activities if somebody give them a littel adviesment to participate people and help them in so many ways .in addition , it is scoity clubs  resbonseblity to help young people to give something to community where they live .finally , they some youngs do alots of things to their socity and still .but the other does not for resons which are minshond above .the young people have huge enrgy that should every body take care about it .
