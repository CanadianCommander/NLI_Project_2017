i disagree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .theere are three reasons i disagree with this statement .it is important for students to learn facts before they learn ideas and concepts because learning without facts must be hard to understand what they are learning about .after they know the facts , it would lead students to understand what they are learning easier .as my experience , when i was learning about the world war two , i could not get what the teacher wanted to tell us .and my teacher brought a video of people after the atomic bomb .it was showing the smoke of the bomb and how the bomb affected people s body .then i could start focusing on the history of war .the facts can get attentions from people to learn .for example , the discrimination of african american in 1970 was not big deal for japanese teenagers for now , but it is absolutely big deal for the african americans still .to know the facts such as what happened to african american in 1970 makes people to understand the discrimination and how bad it is .this means people gets concepts of studying something important , and it is very significant to be educated or having knowledge what is going on this world because to see the facts makes world peace .the world peace are not able to made by only one person .all of the people in this world need to have same level of information and truth .if people try to hide the truth , fact , others get a fear and anger .it is going to make misunderstanding among people in the world .the fact in the past can not be changed , so people need to admit what they did or what they have been by others .it is important and easy for students to know facts first when students try to understand concepts of the studying .the concepts need to be though the facts because the facts make people to know and understand even thought it is not about their problem .then people might be started what they need to for the facts .
