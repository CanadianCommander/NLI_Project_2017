i woke up this morning , earlier than the time i normally would .it was an important test day for me , and the last thing i would want to do was to be late for the testing time .i had to leave my house an hour earlier to come to testing place which is normally 15 minutes far away , if there s no traffic !i live in a big city where 1 out of every 6 people have their own vehicles .it s not a big city area wise , but the population is over 1 million people .there are public transportations oppurtunities .which cost almost nothing , but people ( for some reason ) prefer their own vehicles .the gas prices have been increasing rapidly over the last 5 years .it s pretty scary when you think about the amount you would have to pay if you were a person to drive to work every single day .if these people were nt as stubborn to use public transportation services ; they would save a lot of money , and would help the traffic calm down .as human beings , we do nt really know how to use natural resources .petroleum is one of them .up to now we have nt thought about what we would do if we ran out of it one day .people are finally starting to care about the future , and taking some actions to keep what there is .cars also cause lots of environmental damage .they have harmed the ozone layer , and this has increased the effects of global warming .if we want the generations after us to live in a healthy world , we must start decreasing the number of cars we have starting from today .why should a person be wasting money on gas , when they could use public transportation ?it does nt make sense to have personal vehicles when all they do is cause problems .the number of educated and well aware people is increasing day by day .i believe that these are all indicators that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .hopefully i wont be needing to leave the house as early as i do today to get to a place as near !
