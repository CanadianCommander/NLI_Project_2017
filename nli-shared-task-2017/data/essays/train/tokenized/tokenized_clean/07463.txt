the mobility of society is a topic which is often discussed : in newspapers , in politics , but also among friends .should there be less cars to decrease pollution ?yes , there should , but in my opinion this will not happen in the next twenty years .on the contrary , i think that the numbers of cars in the world will stay the same or probably even increase .different reasons such as the need for mobility , improved road conditions , a better economic situation in developing countries and the growth rate of the population will lead to a constant or even higher amount of cars .first of all , mobility is one of the most important points for modern society .also in twenty years , this wish for mobility will still going on .people still want to be mobile , to reach everything within a shortest time period .as it is , cars are the fastest medium of transportation , at least for short distances .thus , the majority will not be willing to give up his or her car only to decrease pollution .in switzerland , there is a lively discussion about improving and extending roads to absorb all the traffic .also in other countries , these measurements are of high interest .if there are more and better planned roads and therefore less traffic jams , even more people will think about buying a car and using it to reach for example their work place .considering developing countries , they hopefully will have improved their situation in twenty years at least a little bit .less poeple will live in poverty , and more will be part of the middle class .this positive development also leads to a higher demand of cars , because a car is a symbol for having enough money .in developing countries it is even more important for people to show how much they earn and therefore to climb the social ladder .finally , the simple fact that the world population in the whole is growing indicates that there will be more car owners in the future than now .the growing demand for mobility in western countries as well as the longer the more in developing countries leads to a higher number of cars in the world .this development is supported by the fact that a lot of countries are thinking of expanding their road system .thus , it can not be thought about a decreasing amount of cars in the future .
