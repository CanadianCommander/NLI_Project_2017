learning is an ability given to mankind .people can learn everything that they interested in .however , in many cases , understanding becomes the most important part of the learning process .for instance , students in their lectures can get many things , yet , in my opinion , they should first understand the ideas and the concepts in order to learn the facts .there are many reasons to support the importance of understanding ideas and concepts .firstly , students should understand the ideas and concepts clearly because they will need them during their life time and also they will need them in the real life when they face up a problem .for instance , i remember my law classes in the university .my professor told about the rights of criminals .i learned that nobody can be judged until it is prooved that he or she is not innocent .when my family tries to judge me without listening to my reasons i put forward this example and they try to understand me .secondly , i believe in the ideas and the concepts .the ideas are very crucial to me that i would evaluate them .in other words , the ideas are very important to me to set my point of view in my life .for instance , i belive that ideas composes our world .beginnig from the ancient times ideas and concepts make our world survive .for example , the ideas of aristotales and pluto , i sometimes consider that how they are skilled with the reproducing the thinking .as a result , the world had gained different points of views .thirdly and lastly , i belive that without understanding the idea , the source , behind , one can not get the fact .firstly , we should understand what is it , what is the concept and what is the idea behind it .in short , what is it that leads us to the fact is important .i remember that my grandmother always reacted to events without understanding them clearly .she was an excited person and unfortunatelly she can not able to reach the real fact because of her misunderstood of ideas and concepts .furthermore , this leads her to have trouble with communication with others .overall , ideas and concepts are forming our lives and the world as well .that is why i belive that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in conclusion , the facts can not become real witout ideas and concepts .
