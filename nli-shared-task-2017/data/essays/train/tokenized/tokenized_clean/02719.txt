the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  is a statement that can be enhanced or contradicted .i agree with this statement for many different reasons .first of all , everything depends on the definition of a `` car  .if we consider a car to be a vehicle with four wheels and a engine that depends on oil in order to function , the statement has a lot of chances to be true .it is possible that in twenty years we wo nt have any petroleum left .the kind of engine we use now would then become obsolete .even if we consider that we will have some pretoleum left , the product would have become rare and its price would certainly rise .only wealthy people could then afford to drive , which would lower down the number of cars in our street .however , it is possible that we find new kind of energies that would adapt to other kinds of wehicles .would we still consider those new wehicles as cars ?if not , the number of `` cars  would be less than it is now , but we would still have new traveling ways .it is also possible that we change only the engine part of the car , using , four examples , hydrogen energy .we would then keep the four wheel pattern , and we would still be driving cars .as time passes , the global population tends to get richer .it implies that the number of potential customers who will be likely to buy a car will rise over the years .even now , some country as china or india are industrializing quickly .more than a billion people are now demanding for cars .if we find news ways of energy , the number of car owners will rise expodentially .the statement will then be wrong .however , if the scientists do not find any other type of energy , our petroleum supplies will turn to be empty in a few years .since i do not belive that we will be able to find and put in use new kinds of energy that cost the same price to exploit than petroleum in less than 20 years , i agree with the statement .
