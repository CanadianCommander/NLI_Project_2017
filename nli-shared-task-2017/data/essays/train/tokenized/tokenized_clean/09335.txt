when people travel , peopple might have different preferences on the way to travel .i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i always like to travel with my plans .i believe that the travel planed by myself always makes the travel enjoyable due to three reasones .in the travel led by myself , it enables me to decide where i can visit , how long i can stay at the place , and managing those plans make me a great traveler .as i travel to somewhere , i have to think where i better to go .if i want to have a great trip , i have to know some information of the place .it is not only about places , but also the weather , transportations and so forth .through those process , i can decide the place to travel and the place will be based on my interests .that s why it might be one of reasones .during travel , there might happen something different things from my expectation .for example , the place , introduced in a travel magazine , might not be really beautiful place than i expected .if those accidents occured , i would arrange my plan for the trip .i might leave the place and move to next plan .in this sence , i can adjust my plan to the situations .therefore , i might like freedom in my travel .with whole process to have a trip , i can learn a lot of things that i did not know .if i participate a travel with a tour guide , the tour guide will schedule everything .although the travel with a tour guide might be easy and not necessary to plan a lot , i want to learn many information for the trip .by those three main reasones , i disagree to the opinion .in addition , i prefer a travel led by myself .o
