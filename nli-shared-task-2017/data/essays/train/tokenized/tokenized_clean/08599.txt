cars are indispensible for our lifes since they are used very commonly and since they facilitate our transportation to high extent .even though this statement is a fact , some people still think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years time .what i think is just the opposite due to two reasons .the first reason is that the technology in twentieth century is improving very fastly that might lead to a decrease in the prices of cars .as most people experince from computer world , when something new is introduced into the market , the older one gets cheaper and more people can have the opportunity to buy the older one .i think same situation is also valid for cars .since many companies are working on providing cars with superior qualities , the prices of some old cars , still with really good properties , will decline and therefore more people will be able to afford to buy a car .the second reason is that there are many research going on the development of alternative energy sources for transport other than petrolium , which might provide cheaper fuel for cars .as most of you know , nowadays many cars are run on natural gas instead of petrolium making the travel expenses much cheaper .this already lead to the increase in the use of cars as i observed .since the fuel is becoming cheaper , people reluctant to buy cars since they do not want to pay huge amounts of money for driving will change their minds .furthermore , some hopeful research is also going on about the use of hydrogen in transportation vehicles which might even further decrease the price of the fuel since it is really an abundant element in the world .in conclusion , due to some technological advances in car production market and hopeful research about alternative energy sources such as hydrogen for vehicles , which will lead a decline in the prices of both the cars and the fuel , people will tend to buy more cars in near future .
