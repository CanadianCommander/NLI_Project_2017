i totally agree with this point . .that more succesful the person will be more risks or more new achievments will be given a thought .as it is saying .success is not journey like life it is destination and every body has to accept it .becuase nobody is perfect in this world and everybody do have a learning curve .so , to achieve all these with success .one has to take risk to try something new or to achieve some thing new .doing the same thing will not yeild profits and fame for a long time .being improvised in new things is also a important factor .it can be stated with such an example .our scientists were successful in making rockets .but to prove it to society and science that they works the way it should .it should be shown practically and for showing it practically they have to take risk by sending them into space with humans .it was a big risk .but they took the chance and also got success .if they had thought that , using rockets will be dangerous .they could have stopped making them and even not using them in future .it is completely like this saying .winners and successful people do nt do the same things repeatidly .they do things differently .and for doing it differently .risk has to come .the knowledge that is engraved in people can be crafted in more suitable manner , by taking chances and imparting that previous knowledge in inventing some thing new by introducing some new ideas , facts , thinking and risk .because no body knows will it work for the very first time .it may not .so ending the part here only .i strongly supports and agree to the point .that successful people try new things by taking risk .not believing on fact that the knowledge they have is more than enough because again no one is perfect and everybody have a leraning curve .
