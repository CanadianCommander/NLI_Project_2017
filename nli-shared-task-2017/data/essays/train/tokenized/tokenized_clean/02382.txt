today , gaining braodband information gains more anf more importance with the development of science and technology , basically , the academic environment is the one who follows the technology more closely than the other institutions and companies .it can be easily stated that the people who want to be involved in so much information should be in the acdemic environment .the people who invented new things that changed our lives had come from the academic envirenment .for instace , take a look into the history of science and technology .you will confront with einsteins , pasteurs and etc .the common thing in all these people is that these people come from academics .in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .if you again take a look at the history , you can easily see that the inventions had been made by people who can combine their knowledges from different areas .for instance , did you know einstein was working as a patent officer before he came up with the famous relativity theory .this fact should not be a surprise for anyone because he was reading lots of patent documents during his work in patent office .he combined these subjects that he had gained from patents and his academic experience .it is also good to be an expert in one academic area but the person , who builds his academic carrer in this way , is generally limited with the information in one area .the good thing is that he knows all the details of informaton in one area with an enormous depth but it generally requires to have intemediate level of informaton in all academic areas to come up with innovative ideas .these people who have information in all areas take information from the experts in specific areas .i think that it is generally better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .the history of innovation is full of people with intermediate level of information from all academic areas .think again if a person can go much further in general if he is an expert of only a small academic subject .
