the answer is this questions depends on ur own likes , hobbies and life experiences .in my point of view ; i dont agree with this statement beacuse i like the motor sports and enginees .im a mechanical engineer .even if the most people dont use cars in the future ; im sure that i wont leave this habit , im going to use cars in the future .i know my answer is emotional .the techonologhy is getting more modern everyday .and the word pollulation is growing up too .because of the traffic problem we need to use puplic transporting vechiles like metro or bus .there are a lot cars on the streets and its really hard to travel by car .for example travelling by metro is really easer than the indivual one .and in twenty years the trains will be faster than now .acutally im not sure about we are going to use cars in twenty years .maybe we will use different type of cars in the future which have the ability of flying .its really early to say thats kind of firm ideas like that .now we use cruise control in our cars and there are a lot of system that can help to driver .who knows whats gonna happen next ?the most important important reason that i need to suppose this statment is technologhy .the scientists are working for transporting objects with the speed of light and they succeed about transpoting lights .now the turn is for physical objects .im sure that they are going to solve this problem and then we will able to travel faster , needless to say , there will be fewer cars than there are today .and this the right thing about our future .because the world temprature is rising up by cars or which are using oil .if we want to stop this we need to find different inventions better than cars
