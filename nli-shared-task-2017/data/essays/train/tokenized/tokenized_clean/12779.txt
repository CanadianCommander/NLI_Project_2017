i do not agree in total with the statement mentioned because there are two sides of the coin associted with issue .let us discuss those issues in agreement with the topic .the world has been transformed in to a global village .life seems to getting busier and busier everyday with the youth playing a pivotal role in any organisation thay work . .people especially , the younger ones are occupied with their jobs and other trivial commitments associated with the jobs .it is clear that they donate a chunk of their time to their jobs working for the success in their careers fantasing a real comfortable life . .with the development of science and technology ( which indeed reflects in media ) , the social responsibilty towards the community is lacking .people no longer feel it is their duty to have a clean community .let us begin at the elementary level .keeping a street in a good condition is seen as a duty of the government organistions and all the blame goes to them for not keeping the street neat .while a deeper probe in to the issue may seem to lead to a funny situation as the citizen especially the younger ones are very irresponsible to it .the young people no longer feel that the duties towards the community are to be fulfilled rather than the rights which they demand for .so , duties should always outweigh rights .the establishment of social-service communities especially to enhance a feeiling of duty towards the communities clearly asserts the fact .now let us deal with the statement that young people have enough time to help their communities .it can be described a the insensitivity of the author to look at the issue from a different facet .what does community helping mean ?it simply means having and donating time to a better , efficient and prosperous community .i believe that even though the direct approach is lacking to help and participate in the community help programmes , what the youth are doing is indeed going to improve their own community by and large .illustrating this ,, just think of as situation where the division of labour does not seem to exist .the butcher , milkman , vendors selling awide range of things , blacksmith , gold smith do not start doing their duty .the community would be literally in chaos and this would led to inefficient functuioning of the society .not to forget the central fact that the order in society is basically bulit on the type of jobs the youth who comprise a substantial amount to the soceity .
