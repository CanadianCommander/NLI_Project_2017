everybody knows the problem with traffic jam and the more time you need to get from one point to another because of that .reason for that is the increasing amount of cars in the industrial countrys .nowadays nearly every household has one or more cars .the new drivers with eigthteen years get immediatly a car .in the same way the use of other traffic possibilitys such as the bus or a train goes back .but what will be in the future .will there be more cars or not ?there are several reasons to suppose there will be more cars in the future for instance the faster creation and building of new car modells .the high variation of cars increases the choice and let the prices fall down .it is becoming easier to buy a car because there are many suppleys for the customers to finance a new car .to own a car is getting more and more important for work and also for prestige .furthermore it is less expencive to go by car then by train or bus even if the petrol prices have raised very much during the last years .on the other hand people want to save their environment more and more .one step towards that is not to make so much dirt .cars are still not very environmental friendly .when the petrol is burned many dangerouse toxics occures .beneath the climbing rate of cars also the environmental awarness in the minds of the people increases .that could be a reason why they could change to puplic traffic again or share their cars with family members or friend .the automobile sector works against this end .all the cars are getting more friendly for the environment and they use less petrole than in former times .there are even cars that works with solar cells .to conclude you must say that the amount of cars directly depends on the technology
