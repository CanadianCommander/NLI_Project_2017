the informer storyi agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons , first , i work in advertising and second understand about how people perception of products its affected by advertising .because i work for an advertising agency i know that we develope advertising campaings that make the products more appealing to the consumers so the fell more attracted to buy them .i also know that some products had not special benefits but thanks to advertising we create a new world around them so people see the products as a new ones or improved .the second reason its because we , in advertising know how to affect peoples perception of a product .so we use advertising to change this perception allways trying to create the ilussion that the product its better than it really is , so people go right away and buy it .there are regulations among comercial comunications that keep advertisers to tell lies about products or its benefits , so its in our hands to create the new reality of the broduct without telling lies , and that is crativity .in conclusion advertising makes better look products but without making them a liers .everything depends on consumer perception .
