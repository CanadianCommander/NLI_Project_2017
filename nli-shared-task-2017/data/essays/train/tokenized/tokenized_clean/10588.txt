in my point of view , to travel in a group led by a tour guide has two main advantages :- first , traveling as a group one has the opportunity to easily meet new people which i consider as part of the fun to travel .the experience that is shared combined with the proximity in which are kept the members of a traveling group will render the exchanges really easy among them .- second , when one travels , by definition , he does not know what to see nor do in the place visited .a lot of people find it more convinient to take a tour guide rather than gathering this information from other sources such as internet or travel books .the tour guide is generaly a local that , according to his experience , knows depending on the amount of time his group has , which sites will interet it the most .although those two arguments can be true , i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .even though it is of course more easy to meet people within a group you are traveling with , the interest of traveling is to discover the culture of the places visited .the best way to achive this is to travel alone and therefore be motivated to go and meet local people .those personal exchanges teach a lot about a local culture and can create long lasting links between people .also following a tour guide has more inconvinients than advantages .first , you can not choose what you want to see , this choice being taken by the tour guide .with the information now available there is multiple cheap sources that can let you decide what to see and do .second , unfortunatly , even more in some foreign countries , the tourists are only considered as a possible source of money .therefore , very often the guide will be partly paid by local buildings , shops , restaurants , ...to make you come to their place although they are of minor interest .in conclusion , i would recommand to travel alone without a tour guide .
