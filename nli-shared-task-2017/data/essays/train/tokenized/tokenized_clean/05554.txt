i do agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knoeledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .because of differents reasons .firts , i believe that it is nice to be able to talk about differents kinds of themes .for example , i would love to have the opportiunnity to debate about economic problems with a person and discuss world history at the same moment with another person , such as it could be a dinner with friends .also i believed it is better to have and idea about differents aspects of life because it shows what is important for a person in their lifes .the idea of be interested in a variety of stuff for me is a way to demostrate that he or she is a culture person who wants to learn more and more about life .besides , that is a statement that i have been debateing with myself lately becacuse i am at one step to enter to the university , and i had to choose whether a carrier that contains knowledge of many sbujects , such as international relationshiops ( i. r ) , or to choose one with more specific information .since i like to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , i decided to follow the i. r carrier .in conclusion i prefer to have knowledge of differents aspects beacuse i have the strong believing that it is important to be informed about almost everything .in addition to that , i think that with this kind of knowledge , society personal s image of a person is gonig to be better and more interesting .finally it is the kind of knowledge that i considere appropiet for the university carrier that i had decided to follow .
