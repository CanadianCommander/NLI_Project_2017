i like to think that i am the kind of person who is willing to like to travel very much .addition to that , the best and most important thing for a travel is to be in a group led by a tour guide for some reasons .firs of all , to travel in a group by a tour guide is more economic .when i was in my country , i was going to travel to istanbul with my friends .as you know , istanbul has always become a very critual city throughtout history .to learn istanbul and see every place of its is always megical to me .hence , we planned to speak with an advisor who was working in a tour company in istanbul .the tour cost approximately 1.000.00 dolar .and also , all our requriments was going to be given by the company .however , the reason was that we could not offer that money .therefore , we got some credits from the company .the most beautifil things were we could save our money .being in a group led by a tour guide gives you some opportunaties to you .you can save your money because you will be able to know how to spend your money before the travel .during your travel , you do not have to determine your payments because they will have done by the company before the tarvel .the second reason why i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is that you can develop your friendship and you can learn more things about the city that you will visit by the guides .during your travel , you can have a conversation with people who are from diffirent country .for , some travel companies make their tours with tourist .therefore , you can meet people from other countries .for example , our tour was with german students and we discussed with them turkey and its importance for european union .furthermore , i learnt many interesting things about istanbul that i didnt know from the guide .since they are educated about the cities that they are responsible for , they know the some hints of the cities .during your travel , you can ask them some questions about your things that you will see .finally , the reasons i have just mentioned above , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .it offers you some opportunaties before and during your travel .
