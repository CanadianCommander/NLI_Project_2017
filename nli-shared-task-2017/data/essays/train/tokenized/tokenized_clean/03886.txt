today , our communites and cities suffer under a large variety of problems .often this problems are money based problems , but they are also suffering under the lack of activies of yopung people .i think the youth of today takes less care about hepling their communities .so , ask your self , why are our ccommunities so dirty , or why there are less socuial activities of young people in our cities , and why it seemed so that nowadays youth is more selfish .when you take a look to some public playgrounds , you will find them in very bad conditions .they are so dirty that they can not be used by toddler or tiny tots .in most cases theses places are dirty because young people misuse this place for hanging around and distroy them .this is an evident , for mine , that they don not appreciate the communitie s playground .so , they do nt help the communitie .also , the youth has got less social activities .they do nt help older people or do other important social work in ther neighborhood .and , when they do nt to such important mentioned tasks , they scarce care about the need of a communitie .and finally , todays youth has become more selfish , the rest of society as well , but especially young people want to reap their benefits .they take all benfits and goods from other they are able to get , but do nt want it to pay something back .for them , the communitie count much , often the communitie is indiffernt to them .also the do nt build up any identification with their home town .by and large , it seems to that every thing goes down the drain .there are server problems in our societies , and they are difficult to solve .but i am quit sure that we will mange this problem and that this will change .
