successful prople try new things and take risks and not just confining themselves to fields they already know .they do use their existing knowledge to try new things .using their existing expertise they develop courage and bent of mind to look into new aspects and find out the new things .successful people try new things .they look into other aspects and do not fear from looking deeper into that .every body knew that apple falls towards earth but only einstein aked the question `` why  and dared to find out the reality .he didnt simply accept that things are like this .he investigated into this and today we have the explanation for many phenomena based on his theory only .today we have many technological advancements going on .many scientists are working on those findings .if these scientists had not taken the risk of exploring new things we would have been still in the same state as our ancestors .these scientists were successful as they tried new things and worked hard to find them .all the discoveries owe their allegiance to successful scientists who tried to find new things .had the columbus not set on a sail to prove the earth is round he would not have discovered a new country .success always favours those who take risks .industrialisation is occuring at rapid pace .persons setting them up are not neccessory technocrats .but they want to try new things and hence taking risks .ideas are no one s property .every one can think new and work for them .but only those who beleive in them and work on them are successful .they work and gain the expertise slowly .the fear of being getting failed and not taking risks can not bring success .if a child doesnot take the risk of running he will never become good athlete .all the successful businessmen are there as they tried new things that were later on accepted by the whole society .at the same time some may say that if a person works on what he knows he will be more successful .this is true to some extent but in the same field also he needs to think differenly and try new things .if a persn continues to work on what he knows , he will not be able to expand his horizon of knowledge .to gain perfection also he needs to try new things and take the risks .thus it can be said that for success in any field whether known or not there is need to try new things nad take risks .the fear of being failure and not looking at new aspects can not bring success .
