personal intrests are far more important than the intrests of the community , especially in a world where it requires utter dedication and hardwork to survive .in the yesteryears , the world would have been moving at a far more relaxed pace and never this competant .this not only enabled young people to dedicate their time but also their energies toward their community there by taking it forward .not only this , there would have been much less distraction to their work .for example , if we take a student pursuing studies at a university , he would had to deal with far less competition in his studies .there by allowing him to allocate certain amount of his time for community activities .with less population in olden days , there were sufficient opportunities for suitable young people to work at their hometowns - giving them an opportunity to work with their communities .the young people of the bygone days would never have had to deal with the pressures of contemporary times .hence there would have been an obvious amount of time for them to work towrds their communities development .the situations which the current generation of young people have in their hands are far from what the young people from the bygone days would have had to endure .they have to deal with constant pressure to succede in life without loosing out much .and young ones of this generation are often burdened with the responsibilities of family .this definitely leave them with very little time and energy to work towards their communities .adding to this , the everlasting temptation to earn more money and enjoy the luxuries that other seem to enjoy , which in a sense not a negative thing at all .after all every single indivudial has the desire to enjoy his life to the fullest .i therefore conclude that , it is not wise to accuse the younger generation of not being able to apens much time for their communities , given the desire their reach great heights in life .
