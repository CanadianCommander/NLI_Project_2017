to understand ideas and concepts is very important , but not more important than to understand facts .at the contrary , i would say that the order in which they know both things is the real point .i think that if you want understand facts , you need to know before well ideas that are at the base of them .behind the facts there always are concepts .that is why when the students go to school , they need an education from their parents before .mainly the education in family is the base which teachers can build on .exactly like when it needs the house to built the roof .so , concepts and ideas , learnt when they were children , and improved by going to school , and reading books and studying , must be strong and very clear , to build the facts on .a very good example is to study history .when a student studies history , he/she would need to know some clear ideas , to understand well which are the causes of a war , which thinks and feelings were involved to cause a war .when they know the ideas , they will figure out easily the consequence of the act of the war , caused by ideas .but especially , to understand the very central concepts of every-day life is important to live in harmony with other people .they should know which are the right behaviours to live in their society , and these they should learn by their parents , and by growing up with their friends .as a consequence , they will be able to apply the ideas to their lifes , and to transform the concepts in acts .however , if they had understood only the consequence of ideas , the facts , they would not deeply have comprehend what there is behind them .in other words , if they know the causes , they can use them to figure out the facts .to sum it up , i think it is important for students to have a deep and strong background of ideas and concepts about central points of which are the right and wrong behaviours , and about evrything about the life in general , to be able to use them and transform in and understand the facts , for all the duration of their life .
