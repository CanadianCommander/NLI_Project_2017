i agree with this statement or at leat i hope it will become true since there is a real environmental need for re-organization of our communication means .climate overheating calls for it .that said , this wo nt be possible without in-depth modifications of how people consider their way of living .cars are now very successful consumer products for several reasons ranging from comfort to social standing .first of all they are very comfortable for they can transport individuals easily from one point to the other , avoiding the inconvenients of public transportation ( like suffering the weather while waiting , the noisy and narrow environment that is to be found in buses or trains , etc. ) , bringing you exactly where you have to be ( contrary to public transportation that is only present on main roads ) and being immediately available .the second reason is that they participate to one s appearance .in a period where appearances are - sadly enough - worth more than money or gold for a lot of people , they are a very ostensible element of one s ( self - ) identification to a social category .lots of people put a great pride into their car and worship them more than what would be expected of them .i think there is a need for change .and being a frequent car user does nt inhibit all logical reasonings in me .the streets become overcrowded with car , getting from one point to the other takes more time than ever , pollution is becoming so heavy that it endangers our eco-system and our healths .the solution will be found in public transportation .more precisely , in a densification of public transportation routes , in an increased quality of public transportation means to offer more stability , more silence and to offer other services , some of which can be of great use to professionals ( think of the internet , for example ) and in a reduction of their costs .i think the train is a very interesting solution for long-distance transportation ( think of the success of the tgv and eurostar ) while subways and tramways are better for short-distance .buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes .let s not be too lazy and forget the bicycle .a quick look at amsterdam and belgian cities like ghent could be a good example of their utility and of the fact that habits can be changed in favour of a healthier world .
