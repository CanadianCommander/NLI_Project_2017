recently , it is more common to have a tour guide while travelling than going a trip without a tour guide .while some people like to have a tour guide to see many attractive sites , in my opinion it is not the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide because of it has lots of restrictions .first of all , people travelling with a group led by a tour guide have a time constraint while travelling .suppose you want to spend more time in a museum than in anywhere else , but you are given only 20 minutes to stay in the museum .how possible is it for you to stay when the bus leaves after that ?if you have the flexibility of your time , you would not have to encounter this kind of problem .second of all , travelling with a tour guide with a lot of people will more likely give less personal experiences .i would like to give my experience as an example .last summer i went to a trip to the rocky mountains in british columbia canada with around 30 other people and a tour guide .we went to so many places in such a short time so that i could not remember where i went .when i was checking the photographs that i have taken , i could not say any difference about the lakes and mountains that i have went .even though i have seen only lakes and mountains for the whole three days , i could not remember one of them in special , because we had spent only short amount of time on each place so that i did not have any special memory or a feeling in one site .to conclude , i would rather travel with my few close people without a tour guide than having lots of restrictions while traveling .a famous poet said ,  travel to discover yourself .i would rather have more time for myself in one site while travelling than visiting many spaces without any specail memory .
