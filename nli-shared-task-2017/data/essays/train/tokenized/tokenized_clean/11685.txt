according to the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today i think these statement is wrong .in my opinion cars are the most important transportation vehicles in our society .in modern buisness flexibility is one of the most important things .only the car allows everybody to carry distances at every time he wants to every place he needs .public transportation systems have a lot of advantages especially in big cities whith only little space .in these cities most of the people are travelling everyday on the same route .but for longer distances public transportation systems are not flexibil enough .another argument for my opinion is that having a car makes life more easy .for example a car is very usefull if you go to the supermarket buying a lot of boxes of water or beer .it is impossible to carry these things by bike or by bus .but one of the most important reasons is that people feel more independent when they have car .they are not dependent on other people ore public transportation systems .in my opinion people wo nt never give up these advantage unless they can not affort a car anymore .for example i need my car nearly every day because my parents live in a small city which has hardly any public transportation system .there ar only few busses and they do not reach most of the places .i think public transportation systems are to exspensive for small areas or cities .but most of the people in my country live in small towns or villages .that s why a car is so necessary for a lot of people .of course cars cause a lot of problems , especially the enviromental polution .but these problem can be solved by inventing new alternative technics .for example it is a good idea to resarch in hydrogen fuel or develop a fuel made of plants .because of all these reasons i do not aggree with the statement i m asked about .
