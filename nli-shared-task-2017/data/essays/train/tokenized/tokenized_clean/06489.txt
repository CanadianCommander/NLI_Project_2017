i disagree with the statement because taking risks is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many years .there are hundreds of companies i never heard of that were founded by a person took risks to make some money .even though it may sound easy , but it is very complicated : dealing with employments , monthly or yearly payments , government taxes , etc .as the result , only a few companies or even no company will survive .the result makes many people become moneyless or deptors .taking risks is not a good idea .trying is not a bad thing , but risking is not a good thing .there are only a few people who succeeded by risking , while there are millions who unsucceeded by risking .that s why people who only does what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risks .for example , early pioneers tried to make flying possible for humans .of course , the inventors succeeded , but the others lost money , wasted time , or even died .but now billions of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplanes .how did that happen ?the manufacturing companies invented better airplanes , based on the early inventors  designs .in other words , they invented what they already knew how to do well .then the manufacturing company succeeded , selling thousands of the same model , for the same price , and ending what it s like today .there are many successful people who tried new things and took risks .but there are more people who succeeded by not taking risks and only doing what they already know how to do well .like i mentioned earlier , taking risks could change people s lives in a bad way by making them lose money , or even killing them .but only doing what you already know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed .
