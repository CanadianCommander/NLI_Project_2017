i agree with the saying that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to focus only on his/her specific subject .because doing so have a lot of advantages , not only in academic researchment .but it s also important for one to make real academic achievement .firstly , our science system have been and is developping rapidly nowadays , making the relationships and interacting between different subjects more and more .so you really can not just focus on one simple subject , because the broader you view , the more it helps to understanding what you are specific for .as for me , though my major is computer networking , i also read a lot about other academic subjects such as biology and physics , even social arts .because i found when communicating , the behavior of people in society and the computers in a network is much the same , so we can use the same method to look deep into it and see how it organized and cooperated , and we can learn much about both of it .secondly , a broader knowledge make one person more sensitive .this kind of scientific sensitive is extreamly important when making scientific inventions .it s because person can find the similarity between two things and make some really brillant solutions or ideas , which is impossible if people just know the little thing of his major field .in science history , a lot of invetions and discoveries came from a cross thinking of two distinct subject of science .of course , people should first know well about what he/she is specific .but too much specialization just limit the person s eyesight and make he/she blind .so the idea that people should broad their knowledge is right .at least it works for me .
