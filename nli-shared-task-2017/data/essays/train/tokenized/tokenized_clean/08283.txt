i agree with the idea of  successful people try new things an take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .the idea is true because of this 3 reasons : they are aiming to enjoy from life , they always want improve their abilities and lastly they are getting bored from what they usually do .this 3 reasons make them succ first reason is that they are aiming to enjoy from life .for those people living in a world means , making researches about things that they do nt know and that they have nt heard of about .and making researches about new thing cause them succesful second reason is that they always want to improve their abilities .for example : last time in my project i used items that are maid by me to express about the places that i was presenting in my project and i succeed .next time i will take photos and will use them in my project although i am not good at taking photos ; but i decided to take photography lessons .at the end i will learn how to take photo at least .learning new thing cause people to be succeed .lastly , for successful people to take risks is an enjoyable event that causes their adrenalin to move up , by this way they will be away from their routin life that they used to live and it will bring joy and happiness .this happiness and joy will cause the successful in life , as a conclusion the idea of trying new things and taking risks rather than onyly doing what they already know how to do well causes people to get success at the end .
