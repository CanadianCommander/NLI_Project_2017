car-one of the few things which people are proud to posses .twenty years are way too small for the cars to leave the roads a bit vacant .a car is a basic need just as food , shelter and water .the big guns of car manufacturing industry are spending millions of money to bring out more fuel efficient variants in to the market .considering the present situations i dont think that there will be any decrease in the number of cars in coming forty years .there are countless reasons why people are so enamoured to their cars .cars , beside providing an independent and effective mode of transport , provide various other services which inclide both social and personal .the key of your car is not just a key for the car but for a key for you to travel whereever and whenever you want .beside providing privacy cars also prove to be status symbols in the modern society .some of the disadvantages of cars which pave way for the discussion of eliminating them are as follows .firstly , the pollution emmitted by the cars has put the environment under great threat .secondly , with increasing population , the number of cars are soaring high .thus resulting in traffic congestion and parking problems .but the manufacturing industries have been spending huge amount of money to develop more fuel efficient and pollutionless cars .and some of those efforts have already given positive results .one such outcome is the hydogen fueled car .these cars use hydrogen as fuel emit nothing but water which in turn is ased as coolant for raidators .and hybrid cars are already on the roads which combine the advantages of fuel cell cars with the traditional petrol cars .in addition , these cars prove to be space conserving thus solving congestion problems .hence thecars will continue to enjoy the throne of the roads till more cost effective and space convenient modes of transport are developed .and billions are hopeful that they will witness the era of flying cars , transmitting the dream of every kid behind a window into reality .
