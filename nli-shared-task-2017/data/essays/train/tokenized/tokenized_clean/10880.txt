i agree to the above statement .its important for the students to undertand the ideas and concepts of the subject .understanding ideas for any student is little difficult .we need more concentration ability for clear understanding .generally we understand things when listen it or read about it .completely understang the concept is something that we need to spend lots of time for it .unversities should encourage the students for doing more projects in their intrested subjets .this kind of system is avilable in very countries such america , uk , australia and so on .as the students does projects on the subject , they go deep into subject details , such how , where , and why .this are key words in any subject to understand it completely .if they just learn the facts its not usefull for them .most people forget what they learned in their lower classes .because learning facts it is something that we usually mugg up .for example electical student as less knowledge than the electician , because the electrican practically works on it .as the student just learns about it .if profersior is explaing about television , he should bring tv to his class rome and explain about its parts and its functioning , not just theoritcalys explaing about it .universites should provide a machanism that concentrates on students pratical knowledge about subject .and how he undertands ideas and concepts on it .one such machanism is providing projects for the students .and allowing him to choose the project of his age , so that he can understand it easily .
