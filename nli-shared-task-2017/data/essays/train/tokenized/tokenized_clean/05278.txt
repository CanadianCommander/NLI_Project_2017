i agree with it .when i was young , i did not give my time to helping my community .becouse my community did not need not only me but also my friends .and i did not know how to help my community .even now i do not know .of course i did clean my town , but my porpse was not to help my community but to talk with my friends .and i sometimes helped old people with heavy bags .but it was natural .moreover when i was about to help with a preparation of my community s festival with my friends , an adult said to us that you children did not need to help us , went on play .instead of helping my community , i want to play and talk with my friends .i know it is important to communicate with my community .but i do not care about my neighboor .anyway my community consists of old people without young people .if i get older , i will give time to my community .but young people should spend their time to do whatever they want to do , for example studying , trip .they are better for young people .
