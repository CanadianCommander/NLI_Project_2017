i am a young person and i agree with this statement .i thing we do not give enough time to helping our communities .in fact we do not give enough time a lot of things .for example we do not read enough or we do not go to cinema and theatre enough .we spent huge times for internet chat and computer games . ..etc .and i thing chat and computer games are very unnecessary things .but unfortunately chat and computer games have commoned very easy and fastly .i thing we correct this situation shortly times .if we do not correct this situation our young people will give up helping their communities .for example using the telephone has decreased since the internet commonly .young people chat with they do not know everyone .and they do not know that they are lier .also young people do not give enough time our friends .we choose play computer games or chat .so our friends is decrease .finally i think we are giving enough time to helping our communities .
