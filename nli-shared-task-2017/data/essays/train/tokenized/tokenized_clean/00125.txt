i agree to the statement that yound people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think that they are not likely to join the community events , they are not frequently share the burden of the communities and it is not often that they help the neighbors who are in need .first example of this is that young people nowadays do not join events that are held by support of communities such as festivals and community meetings .there may be several reasons to be claimed by them .they may be very busy for working , they may have moved from their hometowns and may be not familiar with the community .whatever the reason is , it is true from my experience that the younger the people are , the less frequent they will join the community events .another example is that they are not likely to share the burden with community members .for example , when the community has a rule that every member needs to go on a patrol by turns , there could be a case where only middle-aged and old people work as assigned .younger peple are reluctant to serve for their own part probably because they are busy , or they are just selfish .moreover , it is not frequently observed that young people help the neigbors when they are in need .even though one of the family members dies , young people who live next to such family will not help them or , in extreme cases , will not pay any attention to them .this can be partly explained that people has become more personal than social and it would be helpful to keep privacy .this can be a good example to illustrate that young people will not give enough time to helping their communities .as these examples as mentioned above , low frequency to join the communiy events , unwillingness to share the burdens with community members and unlikelihood to help neighbors show that young people give insufficient time to helping their communities these days .
