the technology has been improved so much past decades , solving all sorts of problem that we had , and still keep developing .even though the technology is fast improving , there are major problem remaing which is increasing of cars that polluting our enviroments .i cast doubt that twenty years is too short time to prove the problem .first , the speed of developement in technology is unbelievably fast .no one thought that they can talk to each other and see each other in same time with the wireless phone .however , with the technology have so far , only will be able to create another cars such as flying cars or cars that can go under the water .this could not be the solution as the amount of cars will be same as now or even more .it will be great improvement but would not help the problem of pollution by cars .secondly , last twenty years there has been dramatic difference on tranfer matters , di believe that twenty years is too short time to think whether amount of cars will decrease .i strongly believe that one day it will ; however with the technology we have at the moment , can not solve this problem .in conclusion , we are having pollution problems because of increasing number of cars such as air pollution , nose pollution .with the technology keep developing , one day amount of cars will decrease or even disappear by using new way of trans .nevertheless , in my opinion , this can not take place in twenty years .
