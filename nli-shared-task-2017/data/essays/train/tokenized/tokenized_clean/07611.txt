i certainly agree with that statement .in my opinion this is due to a common sense of selfishness that is so widespread in young people .only a few teenagers spend their free time in rewardable activities , such as driving ambulances or helping blinds .the others , the biggest part , think that only enjoyment has importance in thier single life .so the key phrase is enjoy yourself and do nt care of anyone .this is so wrong : if you always think to youself , you will never note how the world needs your help .you can give your contribute only with a simple deed and with a simple attention towards who is suffering or is asking your help .at this common sense contribute the bad examples that television and internet give : almost every famous person s only interested to go to the parties , to have vacations in wonderful places , ..about my personal experience i can say i have never helped my community .in part , this is due to my past and present involving in studies but also in sport activities .in my normal day i have to stay up to 8 hours to the university and then i have to train myself in my favourite sport , the taekwondo .when i come back home i neither can watch the tv without sleeping in front of it .honestly i also must come clean that i am really really lazy .in fact i desrcribed above not my life in the weekend , but also during the weeek .if i could , i would help my comunity in the weekends like some friends of mine do .but , on fridays and saturdays evenings , i want to enjoy myself until the earlier hours in the day .this implies that i am too tired on sundays for help my community taking , for example , dinners or lunches to old people who can not move from their home
