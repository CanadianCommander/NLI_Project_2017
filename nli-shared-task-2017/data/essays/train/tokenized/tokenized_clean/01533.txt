many people hold the view that products are as good as they seem to be in advertisements .i do not agree with them and i am going to explain now the reasons that support my point of view .as far as i am considered , advertisements use to emphasized too much their products .they try to show it as it were the best onje of the market .lets take television advertisements .normally , they present their product with relaxing music , showing their best characteristics , in a nice atmosphere , to name a few .people at home imagine himself with this product and say :  oh !how beautiful would be my life if i buy it . ..we do nt realize that they are cheating us .however , people are not silly either stupid and know that the product it is not as good as its appearence .from my point of view , children are not as strong as adults and tend to believe thats true .that is why before christmas there are som many plays and dolls advertisements .take mi sister for example .she is nine and last summer said that she wants a new doll she watched onj t.v.for her , it was the best one .it was fantastic .my parents bought it as a bithday present .after some days , she realize it was not so fantastic as it seems in the t.v. adevertisements .in conclusion , i found unfair people s behaviour suplying their product but , i can also understand them .in a supply and demand market everything is allowed they need to earn money to live and that s a different way to do it .each one survive as well as it is possible .
