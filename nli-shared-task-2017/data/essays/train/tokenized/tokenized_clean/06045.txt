without no dubt , i totally agree that most advertiments make products seem much better than they really are .there are big two reasons .first , advertiments affect us by the most attractive way .second , advertiments provide us amont of informations .as a result , i think that most advertisements make products seem much better .first , advertiments attract people .most of people wathc tvs and see some advertiments between tv s shows .people see the advertiments naturaly .think about it !! .when you see new ipod s advertiments , you had thought that that s cool .most of peope think same way .in contrst , they just changed coloer and some shapes .they did nt change these dramtically .however , some people think that i want to get it , like me .advertiments make us strong atrract .moerover , how do you choose movie when you would go to movie theater ?of coures , most of people see the advertiment and go to movie , even they never watch the movie .in my experenece , i went to movie theater to watch a movie because the advertiment was look great movie .however , the movie was nt good movie at all .therefore , advertisemtns make us much attract .second , it is best way for us to get new informations .even though , i see new advertisement , i always think that it looks great .everyday , we can see some advertiments in most of ares .
