everybody want to succeed in something .but for some people , success is more about keeping a certain kind of safe situation and not taking any risk to obtain what they want , for other people , risking and jeopardize an established situation is the essence of success and one couldnt makes it without it .is taking risks and trying new things the only relevant way to success ?on the one hand , one must acknoledge that , in spite of a more glamourous aspect than basically choosing for safety , taking risks remains by definition . ..risky indeed .taking risks or trying new things might lead to sucess , but can also often make one s situation worse than before .the statement should nt so be applied in any circonstance : take the example of someone who is burdened with a gambling problem .such a person will often loose all his money on the very justification that he can win tremendous amounts of money by taking a small risk !trying new things does nt implies success at any time too .one good example is the franchising phenemenon that keeps on spreading around the fast food restauration services .experience have shown that using an established brand and well known products can be far more interessant for fast food restaurant .customers may be scared of new things , and introducing new products does nt necessary means being successful .but on the other hand , no one can be really succesful without taking any risk .if someone only follows established footsteps without adding any new thing , it is sure that his fate wont be extraordinary too .many of the `` success stories  one could heard about are mainly grounded on an invention , or on a risk taken : bill gates became the richer person in the word by creating microsoft windows , fosburry won all the high jump competitions by using `` fosburry  technique . ..galileo himself took the risk of claiming that the earth goes round the sun while nobody else at his time dared believe it !to conclude , i would say that to succeed , taking risks is essential but must remains a calculated thing , keeping in mind the fact that losses can occur , and dealing with this possibility .
