`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .being someone who plans to concentrate the rest of his academic studies in mainly finance it is claer which side i am taking .through a broad knowledge one gets a better view on life and experiences it from many different aspects .through this type of studying one is educated , even if it is just a little , about various different topics .he gets more open minded and can therefore for example contribute with his opinion in many conversations for example .his or her intellectual ability and academic knowledge grow much wider and one understands more about every-day things in different fields .although in studying a specified subject one will lack much knowledge in many aspects and fields , he can on the other hand excell in his or her specific subject .in a additon to the previous point many jobs in our evermore advancing career world require specialists .in the end it is specialists who make great new remarkable discoveries and move the world a step ahead .this is why i believe , taking into account the great competition which dominates the world we now live in one needs to be specialized in a certain field .one can gain more knowledge in his or her field through internships for example .in my opinion if a person really seeks knowledge he or she will definitely find a way to it .one does no-t need to study it .one can always educate him - or herself through books for example during his or her freetime .
