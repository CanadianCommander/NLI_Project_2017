industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area becomes more popular in our country recently .it is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area .however in my opinion it is not a good idea .firstly , people with a broad range of interests can not learn and use everything well .it is obvious that human beings have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend .specializing on a specific subject makes it possible to use all your efford for it .hence you will be more powerfull on that area .secondly , studying everything may be usefull for someone to see the big picture and sawing some problems easier .however fixing the problems usually needs to be an expert .for example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software , but only an software expert can fix it .lastly , think about the inventions that are really essantial for our life .for example electricity , engines , computers , and so on .all of these are a product of a long training on a certain subject .this process is an increasingly learning process and it does not have an end .hence , people should use all their efford to achieve the point that they can achieve .in conclusion , it may be said that having broad knowledge is better to find the problems or something else .however this is not an effective idea for being an expert and fixing the problems or improving the quality of life .thus , specializing on a certain aspect is better .
