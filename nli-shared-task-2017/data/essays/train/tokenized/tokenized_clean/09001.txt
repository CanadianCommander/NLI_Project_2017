althogh some people would agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , i definitely dissagree with the statement .there are two reasons why i dissagree with the statement .first , it will make you feel special if you have specialize in one specific subject .for example , one of my friends plays have lots of hobbies , such as playing piano , reading , and playing tennis .and i asked her what does she like the best .she said `` i do nt know .i mean i actually do nt know yet what i really like .on the other hand , my another friend only plays judo , he has been practiced judo for 8 years .and he knows that he loves judo , and once he starts talking about judo , he never stop talking .it is not about the academic subjects , but for these people , it works same way .the girl i mentioned first , she has no subject she does nt like , but she also has no subject she really likes .so in the exam , she usually gets all b+ or b - which is not bad , however .while she never gets a , the boy who is playing judo always gets a a+ and c in his exams .i think it is better to have one a+ rather than all b since it will make you feel more special and happy .second , it must be fun to have something special .for example , if you have specialize in one specific subject , it will be so much fun to study .once you learn how much fun to study will help you in the future when you start working .for these two reasons , i dissagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
