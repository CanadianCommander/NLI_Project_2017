normally , i prefer a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .as the point of view in my future career , however , i diagree with having broad knowlege from several fields of academic .first , i would like to pay attention the quality , not the quantity .although it is better to know much more knowledge , i believe that infromation like that is not usefull in my future practical career .also , i can get in touch the knowledge when i acsess the internet .there are so many web pages on the net .whenever i can learn what i want .i do not worry about the time and cost .almost information on the net is free .second , a specialized knowledge is a priceless for me .for instance , to be a specialist needs to not only knowledge but skills in business world .i think that a specialist can only proceed a confused situation in near future .special knowledge and skill can promote me to be success in my future career .moreover , income will be better than average workers .a lawer or a doctor can get high salary during his job because they certainly have a special knowledge and a skill .their mature experiences can solve many forms of problem when the crisis situations happen .also , i can have a confidentional to own job .finally .i dont not totally diagree with a broad knowledge , but these information only take advantage of some trivia or a bit quiz .as i see it , i strongly believe that it is better to acquire a special knowledge in my life .
