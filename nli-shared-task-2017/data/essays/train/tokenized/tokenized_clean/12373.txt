education has always been an important issue since our begginigs .greek scolars created their own system of teaching .curiosity is what take us to the desire of learning .nowadays there are very sofisticated methods of learning .educational systems have been improved since scolastic greek method began .some philosophers of the illustration said that our students were the base of our society .but is is not easy to make a student learn .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .understanding is the process in which people s mind made a clear idea of something .understanding something takes us to a process of learning in which we can not also achieve knowledge , but manipulate things using that knowledge .learning facts is to learn the words of what a law says or dictate us something without being completely sure about it .this method of learning is very risky because it does not allows students to analize deeply the topic , it just tell them what it is .according to tales of mileto , the world is managed by cosmological laws .and this laws can be predicted if the necessary knowledge is achieved .for example the movement of the space corps .by learning the fact of the movement of a specific corps we could know the fact that it moves .meanwhile understanding the idea can allow us to understand the orbit of the corp and we can be able to predict at what time it would appear visible to us .the learning of facts has taken part of our history .aristotle told laws fundamentated on his observations on the fallen of corps in earth .for many years we could not make any progress because the method of learning facts .there were facts considered true just because someone told it .different to this , by understanding ideas we can analize properly what we consider necessary and create our own posture about it .undestanding facts was what galileo galilei did experimentation on fallen of corps .thus he created his own theory .time never lies .true always arise at a certain time such as the methods used by aristotle and galileo galilei .we could certainly observe which method is the correct one .learning facts has many limits .therefore we can conclude that understanding ideas is the best procedure in order to real learning .
