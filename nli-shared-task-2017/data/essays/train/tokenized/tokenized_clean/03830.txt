i do not think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of specializing in one specific subject .having a broad knowledge does not mean that one has a good knowledge .however , it is more important to be good in what you , i think .if a person has a broad knowledge of a lot of subjects , usually it is not very convincing .it takes a lot of time and effort to really learn facts about a certain topic and to understand them .therefore , it is nearly impossible to have both .it would take too much time .furthermore , when applying for a job one usually needs to have specific knowledge of the respective sector they will work in .therefore , one should know what profession they want to prepare for and then get a good education for that specific profession .employers will usually appreciate it more if their employee is an expert in his job .my most important point is that one should not have a broad knowledge because they will not be able to enjoy their lives .they will realize that they are not really good because they do not know details and can not support their ideas with reasonal facts , for example .hence , they will get unsatisfied with themselves .one consequence of that might be that they fall into depressions .another consequence might be that they try to improve their knowledge .however , that is not easy because there are so many subjects they would have to work on .a possible solution would be to finally specialize in one of the fields they are intersted in .in conclusion , i think it is better to concentrate on one subject and to be good in it in order to live a happy and fullfilling life .
