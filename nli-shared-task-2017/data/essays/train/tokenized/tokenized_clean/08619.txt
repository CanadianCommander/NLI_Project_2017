i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .the statement is very vague and general to begin with , and furthermore , it provides no support as to what enjoying implies .it is not correct to generalize or stereotype such large numbers of people .young people , as well as older people , are very different amongst each other .some young people enjoy life , while others hate it , and the same happens with older people .assuming that generalizing is correct , though , i would still disagree with the statement .one can not compare `` apples with oranges  .when it comes to young people , enjoying life might mean enjoying going to parties or clubs to dance and meet new people .when speaking of older people , enjoying life could mean enjoying reading a good book or listening to classical music , or even sleeping !even though at first glance a party might sound more fun or enjoyabel than sleeping , the older person might actually enjoy sleeping much more than the young person enjoys partying , and therefore be enjoying life even more .a past experience with my grandfather illustrates my point perfectly .i always thought he was very boring and that his life was pretty sad , given the fact that he stayed home most of the time .however , i once walked into his study where he was just sitting on a couch holding my grandmother s hand , quietly listening to classical music , and i realized his eyes were watery with emotion .he was enjoying that moment so deeply it was hard for me to understand , but i realized he simply enjoyed life in a very different way that i did ; not more , not less , simply different .furthermore , `` the older the wiser  explains my disagreement even further .with experience , people experiment many activities and situations in life , and they learn to identify which ones they enjoy more .a more experienced or older person has learned over the years to enjoy specifically those things that make them the happiest .by focusing more specifically on those things that they like , older people enjoy life more deeply .on the other hand , young people tend to expose themselves constantly to new experiences , and even though there is a thrill to getting to know new things , it is usually with time that one learns to actually enjoy experiences to their fullest .young people , in their constant attempt to explore new things , usually dont have time to focus enough to actually get to enjoy things to their deepest .the statement is a vague and unsuported generalization , which makes it difficult for me to agree with it .every person is different , regardless of age , and what one person might enjoy , another might not .this does not imply that either person is not enjoying life , or enjoying it to a different degree .
