today , the world has grow on a rapid pace with fast development and high technology .through the innovatives of scientists and engineers , cars become part of our everyday life .in my opinion , the numbers of cars would increase instead of decreasing in twenty years  time because cars are convenient , traffic systems are improving and lack of alternatives .on average , each house has at least two cars in my neighbourhood .this example applies to most of the urban and sub-urban cities around the world too .i strongly think that cars are the most convenient and easy means of travelling on roads .compared to motorcycle or bicylce , it is less dangerous and it could accommodate more passengers .these qualities are equally important to the people in future whether the distance between one place to the other is short or long .consequently , the number of cars would easily increase .besides , cars are undeniably the most important vehicle in the world when it comes to travelling on road .as countries all around the world racing to develop their traffic systems , it is proven that cars serve as the best travelling medium .with the government working on ways to reduce traffic problems and improving the condition of roads to facilitate more cars , it is believed that the usage of cars are highly encouraged .therefore , more people would remain or resort to cars as their main vehicle when it comes to travelling .in addition , there is no adequate alternatives to substitute the usage of cars .due the convenience and easy-accessible of cars , many would resort to cars instead of other forms of transportation .for example , the train .although it is an environmental friendly type of public transport , the construction of the stations and railways would costs the government an exorbitant amount of money .it is rather impossible to connect the whole country with train services .thus , cars are still the main option for the people in twenty year s time .despite the forever increasing price of gas or petrol , and also the number of road accidents , in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use .with the cooperation between the government and the people , those minor factors could be resolve while the people could enjoy fully the benefits of using cars .
