young people enjoy life more than older people .there are two aspects of this statement .time does not stop for anyone .every person faces the every age group of a man s life .when a person takes birth it is in his infant stage .later he grows and passing through aldolence , young , middle age groups and reached the last age group that is old age group .so all age groups are indespensible part of man s life .one aspect of the statement is that young age is the time when a person gets full freedom in his or her life .usually in this age a person leaves away from the home .so he or she is away from any family tension , restriction etc .definately this is the time when a person can enjoy the life maximum .to enjoy the life young people go to parties and disco every other day .young peolple go to different trips for enjoyment .this is the age where there is no reason for parties .reason is just one that is enjoyment .but i would like to add one thing more that this is the age when a person can learn maximum from his or her life .person of young age learn to manage while living in a room with other room mate during college studies .this is time when a person is also more concern about carrier .he or she having a lot tension for carrier .another aspect of this satemant is that to enjoy the life , depends upon a individaul s views , way of thinking , attitude towards life .a person having positive attitude can live happy in any age group .old people do have a lot of exprience of life .they have already seen many ups and downs of the life .so in this age they like to spend time peacefully .at this age this a sought enjoyment for them .so they also feel happy in playing with their grandson and granddaughter in garden , going church , read bible , travelling different hill stations , get togther of old friends , going to club etc .another thing is that a young with negative attitude even can not live happy in the age of most enjoyment .although young people enjoy life more than older people but it also depends on a individaul s attitude towards life .
