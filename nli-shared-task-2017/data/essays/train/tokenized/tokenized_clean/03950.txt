i believe all people may enjoy their lives independent from their age because all of the life stages has their own advantages and disadvantages .thus , i do nt agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .assume that you re 70 and you do nt have grandchildren .if having children of your children is important to you , then you wo nt be happy and wo nt be enjoying your life .furthermore , assume that you are in your twenties and you can not go to dance with your friends .again if it is relevant to you , you wo nt be enjoying your life and age .on the other hand if you have all your expectations from your age , then you ll be the best person in the world and enjoy your life more than anyone in the world .first of all , it s true that being young brings some advantages about enjoying life .like you re energetic , healthy and careless than old people do .traveling , making sports and dating are easy for you .however , it has disadvantages .you may travel more than an old person but in case if you have enough money and permission .you can not shut the door and say to your parents that you re going to a spiritual trip to india .they will ask you why and most probably they wo nt let you .being older has also its disadvantages and advantages .when you are old , this means you are full of knowledge at least in one specific topic .moreover you have one-life long experiences .therefore , people like and want to talk to you due to getting benefit from your knowledge and experiences .you have lots of things to tell such as your memories of childhood , experiences in your work and all these funny and bad luck events .you have faced more years of the world s history that youngsters can not have a chance to see .of course , as a direct disadvantage of this view , you will not be able to see the next generation .to conclude , elder people may also enjoy life as much as young people for me .it s solely about what you expect from life and what the life gives to you .if they fit to one another , you will be enyojing your life at a maximum level whatever your age is .
