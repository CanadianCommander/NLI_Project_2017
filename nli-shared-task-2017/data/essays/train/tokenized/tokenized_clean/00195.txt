i completely agree to the statement and i strongly believe that in order to succeed one should be willing to take chances/risks in life and try unexplored avenues .i d like to support my statement by mentioning following points and examples :firstly , as we all know that we have to live once and as some people say that life is not a rehearsal , i think we have been given just one opportunity to explore different avenues of life .indeed life would become very monotonous and boring if risks/chances are not taken and novel things are not tried .having said that it should be taken into consideration that the chance taken should not harm oneself or others .for instance , if we think of the big names of business world like bill gates and sushil mittal , they could not have achieved their current status , if they would nt have taken risks in their lives .these people were not well acquainted with computers and steel , respectively when they started but because of their willingness to explore and take chance they undoubteldy succeed and reached to the highest level .secondly , i believe that if risks/chances are not taken in most of the areas , it would definitely affect the rate at which we invent newer technologies today .most of the advances are based on assumptions that one would succeed while attempting a particular task .for example , momentous discoveries like computer , internet , telescope , etc. would not have been possible without taking the risk and considering the possiblity of failures .thirdly , i feel that one should be concious of that fact while taking risks/chances that success is not always a surity becasue we always do not get what we aim for .so it s not essentially true that people who took chances earlier are only successful ones , but there are people who were unable to achieve what they desired despite of taking risks .finally , i conclude that though there is no harm in working on only doing something that a person knows well , but i think that would make life very stagnant and our advancement will be badly hampered .so a person should always be willing to lookout for opportunites and take calculated risks in his life and sooner or later he would definitely taste success .
