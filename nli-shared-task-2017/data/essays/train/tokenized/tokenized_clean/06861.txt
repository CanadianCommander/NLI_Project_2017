i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .because young people can do many things which they want .young people play many games which older people cant do .young people rome every where but older people cant because according to their age their stamina will be decreased .young people have much stamina to do everything .the thinking of young people goes with the present generation which older person cant do .for example a young person know much about computer and new softwares .but older people they dont know and they dont need also .a young person can play games to be healthy but a older person , they have to do exercise to be healthy because they cant play all games against the youth .as a people goes old , they behave vey matured .young person behaves as a child sometimes .young people can enjoy the new technologies and new things in the market .they can get all advantages and make easier all works .older person cant enjoy with that new technology or science because they have over come with many things in their lives .young people go to college , office , parties where they can entertain themselves in many ways .but older people cant .because they have already enjoyed their life .young people dont have any responsibilty and stress of family .older people have responsibility and stress with ahich they cant enjoy .they did nt get time after all responsibilities to enjoy .and one thing what older people can do young people cant do .once in my life i struck in a position that i was not able to solve that problem .that time my grand father handle with that problem and solved .it clearly tell that young people enjoy life when older people take care of them .young people walk with the present life , fashion , styles .young people enjoy walking with the generation .older people are simple and make generetion to walk properly .
