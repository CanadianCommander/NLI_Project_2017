according to the statement , the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years .three reasons for that decrease can be stated .first of all , it is stated that most of the people in france live in or nearby big cities , and work everyday in the city .these people choose to go to work by car .because the traffic is very high every morning and every evenig , some of them start to be fed up with their car and think of other possibilities to go to work , such as using the metro or even biking .additionaly , the government insists on the necessity to decrease pollution .since the car is the most polluting travel means , the government encourages people not to use it by widening the opening time of the metro .indeed , many people use their cars because the metro closes at midnight , and they are conseauently not able to come back home without using a taxi after that time .because taxis are too expensive , they prefer to use their car .this decision will convince people not to use their car anymore .finally , another reason why people will not use their cars as much as they used to is that the average age of the population is increasing .in twenty years from now , most baby-boomers will not be able to drive a car anymore .this will consequently reduce the number of drivers and the number of cars in use will decrease .as a conclusion , it is obvious that people will still need their cars , to travel for example .however , many efforts are made by the government and the people to decrease the pollution level , and the easiest way to do so is to reduce the use of cars .it seems to me that , in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use than there are today .
