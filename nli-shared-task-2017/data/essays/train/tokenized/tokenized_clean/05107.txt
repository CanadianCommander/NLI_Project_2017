describing what is meant by `` enjoyment in life  could be very sujective .different people might have different views / reactions on similar situations .while one person might seem to enjoy loud , head-banging music , it might seem sheer noise to another person of his age .i do not quite agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .some people enjoy every moment of life regardless of their age , while there are others who spend all of their time cribbing about what life has offered them .enjoying life has nothing to do with age , but rather it has everything to do with attitude .how one reacts to situations , how one takes life as it comes to him .it is all about that .one could look around to see live examples and the message would come out clear .there are old people who enjoy living a retired life , spending time with their families and friends , socailizing and doing what they feel good to do .on the contrary , one will find young people always striving to make a better living , chasing their dreams and trying to win the `` rat-race  .it is one s attitude that decides how one s life is going to be .as i stated earlier , people might react differently in same situations .some people might enjoy sipping a cup of hot coffee in the cold weather , others might just curse god and nature for the un-easiness that the weather has brought into their lives .enjoyment is not , rather should not be related to age .i could feel good taking a walk down the seaside with my friends when i am young , and i could very well enjoy the walk when i grow old .as they say , `` old in age does nt mean old at heart  !in conclusion , i strongly feel that old people could enjoy as much as young people do , in their own sweet ways .to add to that , they do nt have as many responsibilities as young people do , so they need not worry about many things .life offers every one , a packet full of enjoyment ; it s on you to open it carefully so that it does nt spill out .
