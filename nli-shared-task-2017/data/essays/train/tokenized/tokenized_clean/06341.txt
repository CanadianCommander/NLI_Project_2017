cars are the main means of transport these days in many parts of the world .but i do not think that this would be a case in twenty years from now .many reasons can be stated in support of this thesis .the first reason is that the cost of fuel is growing at an alarming rate as the petroleum reserves are becoming scarce .also there is no alternative to petroleum which is environmental friendly and economical .this will surely reduce the dependence of middle class on cars .the second reason is that today s cities are growing at a rapid pace due to the migration of villagers to the cities in search of better work and living conditions and also due to industrialization .this will increase the time taken to travel to work and other places .also there are traffic jams which can further increase the time .so people may prefer public transport like the rapid transit system which is cheap and fast .this will also help in the government in generating more money which it can spend for other useful purposes .the third reason is that there may be a new invention which can transport people quickly and comfortably .no type of transport was constantly used from the time of early man .from horses to automobiles man has come a long way in inventing new types of transport .after such an invention the car might become a museum exhibit like the horse drawn cabins of the past .all these points can considerably bring down the number of cars runing on the roads .finding out new forms of energy which are both renewable and environmental friendly should be an important concern of today s governments .
