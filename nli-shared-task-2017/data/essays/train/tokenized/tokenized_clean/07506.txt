some persons think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think that it is not true .first , older people may feel not having taken enough pleasure in their previous life , so during their last years they want to do things for which they had not enough time before .thus , they enjoy more each moment and take advantage of the present instant because they know it is their last chance .on the contrary , young people are always in a hurry , they want to do a lot of things , manage to do few of them and they do nt enjoy what they experiment because they are not thinking to one thing at the time .on the other hand , there is a more material reason for which older people enjoy life more than young people : older people are often retired and they are a part of the society with a higher consumption power .it is easier for them to enjoy what the life can offer .for example , they can do some trips that they could nt afford before because they had their children at home and because it was necessary to pay for their studies .however they did nt have time for that because they were working .finally , older people have gain more maturity and they are aware of the value of things .so they can better enjoy what is available to them .the more something is difficult to reach and the more we wait for getting it , the more it will be valuable .the more something is rare , the more it is enjoyable .nowadays , a lot of young people believe that everything is due to them and they do nt measure the value of what they get .when we are older , we are able to meausre the chance we had and that we did nt measure in the past .that is why i think that we must wait to be older to really enjoy the life , because being older give more chance to be able to do what we really wanted .
