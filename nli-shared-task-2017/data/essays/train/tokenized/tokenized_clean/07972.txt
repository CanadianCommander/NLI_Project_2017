in my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning just the facts .this is because students may not understand the ideas from the facts , but students may learn the facts from understanding the ideas .for instance , imagin you are in the high level math class , and instructore gives you an assignment paper .the instructor says just `` do it  , to you .if you have a knowledge about that questions on the assignment , you may do it .however , if you do not have knowledge , you never do it .therefore , you will ask instructor how to solve these questions , and the instructor gives you an answer-list paper .so you can write answers now .this is what i think about learning just the facts .in this situation , you never study math .on the other hand , if you are in the same math class , but instructor exchanged .the instructor gives you the same assignment paper , and he says `` let s start a lecture using that paper  .next , the instructor bigins the lecture to tell you how to solve the questions on the assignment paper , and he also recommends you and gives a few time to consider the solving method or formula .after that time , instructor gives you the answers or correct your idea about these questions , and he also explains why this method is useful .at the end of the class , you have studied math , and if some questions remain on the assignment papre , you can try to answer them from the knowledge of what you studied while hte class .finally , you can say that you study math .
