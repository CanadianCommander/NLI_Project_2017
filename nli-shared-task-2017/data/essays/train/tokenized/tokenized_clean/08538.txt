i completely agree with what the statement asserts .i believe that nowadays students are more and more concerned with their own interests and less preoccupied for their nearby people s needs .students only want to go out with their friends , amuse themselves and have a life without preoccupations and resposabilities .on my opinion this is caused by a society that is getting more and more selfish and because parents and goverments are permiting it .we live in world where people want to get their necessities fulfilled and these ones are related more with personal and individual interests than with social interaction .personally , i think that people were more united before .they used to help when it was necessary and they were taught to be attentive and co-operator with everybody .at the present time , students do nt have these morals or ideals and they do not feel that they must help their communities necessities .that students nowadays do nt have enough time to carry out this kind of social labours it is not a reason , because students have never had so much time than ever .the problem is that tudents are getting more and more interested in playing videogames and other activities than helping their communities .it also depends on the country you live .what i mean is that for instance , students do nt have the same responsabilities and duties in germany than in spain .spaniards do nt have to accomplish any social labour like helping handicaps , invalids or aiding in government jobs like germans do .i think every government should entice his students to carry out miscellaneous labors by making up to them in any aspect .what i mean is that if students do nt feel the necessity or they just do nt feel attracted to helping their communities the goverment should impose them a minimum social work requirement .
