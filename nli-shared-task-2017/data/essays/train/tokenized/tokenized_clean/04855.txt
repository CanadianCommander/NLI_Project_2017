i believe that the young people enjoy life more than the old .there are two major reasons for this claim .at first , the young people are healthier than the old people .health is everything for humans .in fact , if one is not healthy he/she can not enjoy the life at all .most enjoyable human activities , such as relationship with the other sex , eating , doing fun things such as playing sports games , dancing , etc. , require healthy people .as humans age they lose their ability to enjoy most of these activities as much as they used to .for example , a 70-year-old man can not eat food that have high calories and a number of unhealthy ingredient .in contrast , a 20-year-old college student can eat from the same food as much as he wants , and nothing happens .secondly , older people loose their enthusiasm to do a lot of fun activities because of their financial risks .older people tend to avoid doing activities not only because of the health risk , but also financial risks .unfortunately , most of the fun activities in today s world cost a lot of money , such as going for a vacation on an expensive island .at young ages people do not think about financial risks of their action because they think they have a long life to compensate .however , older people would think that if they overspend they may not be able get a job and work to make up for it .although it may be argued that older people would have more money to do the expensive activities than the young people , i think that young people have the potential to work hard and save enough money for these activities .in conclusion , i strongly believe that as the people get older they enjoy the life less because of a number of limitations that aging brings to them .
