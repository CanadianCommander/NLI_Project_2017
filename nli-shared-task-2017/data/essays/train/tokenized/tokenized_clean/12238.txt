in this topic , some student prefer learn the facts , others believe understand ideas and concepts is better .nevertheless , i believe understand ideas is better than learn the facts .first of all , students will usually choose to learn facts when they started the course .because the facts is easily to understand and it is ineresting .but there are some disadvanage about learn facts .it hardly to catch the main ideas , students may only interesting on the stories , but did nt know the meanning .it ca nt happen when you take focus on the ideas or the concepts .because the concepts and ideas are the standard about whole stories .in addition , students choose learning the ideas will help them faster to understand the content about this course .although the facts can let them know how to use it on the society , it still limitied .however we ca nt refuse it can leads students get some experiences .it still not general for the students .finally , the facts may give students some misunderstanding about the course .the facts concluding different type of knowledge .they are all useful .but the knowledge which are concetin about the course may lead students to the wrong way .they may try to take more focus on other course .it is better to teach them the ideas and the concepts , couse the ideas and concepts can keep leading students on the correct way about the course .although i believe understand ideas is better than learn the facts , it still helpful to learn the facts .the facts can give students some experience to let them do nt take the same mistake like the previous people .but the ideas and concepts are the key of the studying .it is the rule about the course .
