according to my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many subjects because of the following reasons .firstly , a person is exposed to different kind of subjects in the elementary school to help him understand his interests .for example , i liked biology in my high school .so i chose to become a doctor .so , i concentrated more on biology so that it helped me when i started my graduate course in medicine .so , i had good knowledge about ` cells  and ` reproduction  than algebra or geometry .even though i had to study other subjects , my idea about them was just to improve my general knowledge and not to go in depth .secondly , i would like to mention that if a person speacializes in one particular subject , their is more room for growth and improvement .such a person will not be lost in the bundle of different varieties of subject , he will not be confused in his approach to the subject .he might aswell do good research on the particular subject and write several books and conduct many seminars to share his knowledge .if a person is not a specialist in a particular subject , he may not be in a position to explore and invent new things in any subject , as the saying goes `` jack of all trades but master of none  .eminent people world over are being recognised for thier meritorious work in a particular field and not for their works in different fields .we all study to contribute something to the society god has gifted every indivdual with some hidden talent in a psrticular field and we need to reconise them before its too late .concluding , i would like to say that `` its always better to be a lion in the jungle than an ant in a colony  . i will always choose to specialize in one subject than have a braod knowledge of many academic subjects .
