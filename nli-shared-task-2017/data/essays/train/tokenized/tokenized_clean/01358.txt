do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do ?i do not think that would be the complete answer .at present , not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones .nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies , such as electronics , giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones , internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young .but this also , is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth .most of the time , these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression .young people is still learning to live , but in a world totally different of the older man .today there is more competition for all , even for finding a job , now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world .this causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience .sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations , and sometimes they take this in the wrong way .the necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs , acts against them .the older people now take advantages of the advances in medicine than can increase their life quality , and in some cases , to cure the illness known to commonly affect them .they , in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation .i think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people .we have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young ones are barely trying to go throw .
