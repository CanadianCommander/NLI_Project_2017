i think that the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are is right .in fact advertising is made for the purpose of push people to buy a product even when it is not needed .to do so the good has to seem much more better than what it really is .the funny thing is that the mismatching between what is advertised and the real product is openly declared everywhere as it could be read in small fonts that the object can be different than how is picted on the advertising or the box .an example is when drugs are advertised on television .they show someone that feels sick and as soon as the little pill is swallowed he or she gets back to work as nothing has appened .i guess this could be dangerous too .another example is when in a fast food restaurant there are pictures that show wonderful hamburgers that do not look like the hamburgers i get to eat .i also remember when i was a little boy and i saw an advertising about an ice-cream on tv .the ice-cream looked so good that i felt that i had to have one .as soon as i could i went to buy that ice cream , but when i unwrapped it and i saw how the ice cream was in the real life i felt like a fool and got very disappointed .as a conclusion i think that when we look at advertised product we should do it with criticism and be aware of the differences between pictures and real life .
