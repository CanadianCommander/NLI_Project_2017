i m not quite agree with that the travel would be the best when it has tour guide .but it is such a good idea to be with a group .and that guide lead you to know wonderful sites that the guide know them better than the tourists .i would prefer have group guide if i have know idea about the country that i m visiting .i will discuss that difference in details supported by examples .traveling is something nice and let you discover many things that you do nt know before .first , to discover the site that you visit you must have a guide because you have any idea about it at natural .you might be see this site by the internet or a catalog .in this case , the leader of the group will show all the sites that you came for them .second , the leader will give you a coplete idea about the city that you are visiting .for example , you might visit such a country that has historical sites and some these sites s inhabitants home or their ancestor s home .and the leader has plenty background about the history aspects of this country the tourist might want to know from him .in the other hand , i as a tourist i might use the tour guide for just some trips or some sites in particular .for example , i can not use the tour guide when i want to visit a country that i have an idea about it .also i will not use the tour guide if i m going to visit safe country or small country which i can go around the country veery easily .many cases that the tour guide must be with you .for example , if you are traveling with senior people or very old people .the tour guide would make it easier to move from site to site for the old people .
