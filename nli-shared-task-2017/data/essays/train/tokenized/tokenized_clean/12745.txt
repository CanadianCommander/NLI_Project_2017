nowadays , in our countries we have a huge numbers of cars running on the highways , and it seems that something needs to happen to avoid this situation that sometimes becomes problematic .in any case , i do not complety agree with the question .let me explain better , on one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company cars have for the economy .the motor industry is one of the most important industries in the world .so , i suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the cars , without affecting other fields , or aspects of the economy .and maybe it could have impredecible effects .i am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future .on the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet .in this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us .these cars use gas , or vegetal oil .we have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains .in conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question .usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view .i mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling .i try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment .i think that the people will create a new kind of car on this goal , for the future .i hope so .
