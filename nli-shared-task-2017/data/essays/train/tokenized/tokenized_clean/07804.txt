in my opinion successful people try new things and take risks also .in the whole world every one wants to try new things and some people only takes risks .so in that risks some one will succeced and some one will not succeced .some people will try for new things .in that case the people who had already done research in that one some people take that one and also study in that also .why means they want to try for the new things .some people have the idea to try some things and they will do also but they do nt know how to keep that in a well manner .in our world many scientists discover many things .for example `` charles babbage  invented computer .so this computer is playing an important role in every human lifes .so the whole world is using this computers .many scients invented many things like lights , printing machines and etc . . , .so the scientists are the successful people .why because they had tried for new things .so in my opinion every one has to try for new things .so that we can gain more knowledge .but every one ca nt efford for the new things .why means for new things to discover lot of money must be needed .so all will not have so much money .for this reason the students or who ever wants to try for new things can come forward and they should ask the government to provide some things .the government should come forward and they must encourage the students .so if they tried for good things the country will get a good reputation .finally those who are talented they must come forward and they have to use the resources what they had .so that he wil be in a good position .i agree with this statement .successful people must try for new things and they must also take risks .in thse days with out risk nothing can be done .
