i agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons .first , young people are less interested in the activities of their communities , although communities are indispensable for people to live .for example , i participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city .this activity is held every week and young people live in my city is strongly encourage to join , however , there are few young people among the participants .this example clearly shows that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities .second , the vote rate of young people in elections in japan is generally much less than that of elder people , although to join political process of the communities is impotant activity to keep their communities active and healthy .to join political process , the voter must have their opinion toward their commutities .if young people paticipate in their communities , they should have some opinion toward the situation or future of their communities , and they should have strong incentive to go voting .this is the reason why i think young people do not spend enough time to help their communities .third , there are many companies which help elder people with their house hold errands and chores .the copanies run their customers errands instead of instead of the elder people .this business increases because young people will not help their grand parents or their parents .therefore , for above reasons , i agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
