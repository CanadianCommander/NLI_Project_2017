in the recent years , many educators , parents and students have discussed how the students learn more efficiently and effectively .there are two different philosophy that has been proposed in this hot topic .one is to understand ideas and concepts and another one is to learn facts .most western countries like united states and canada , the teachers encourage the students to understand ideas and concepts first .the teaching approach is not bound to the fact that the students do not urge to remember a lot of information and facts from the textbooks .for example , the teachers try to use some daily examples to explain some concepts in science such as physics , chemistry and biology .at the same time , the students can develop their own creative , innovative and troubleshooting ability .meanwhile , it is good for the students to be capable of brainstorming in this very competitive communities .in the other hand , most eastern countries such as china , japan and so , the teachers prefer to ask the students to remember a lot of facts and information so as to build up their fundamental basis on their study .however , most of the students can not advocate their interest in their study .in addition , the students are not willing to accept more new concepts or they are not able to develop any novel ideas in their study .for example , the students are good at memory , but not on any innovation or troubleshooting issues in their living either .thus , it is not an effective and flexible way for them to deal with the difficulties and hurdles that they really face in the reality .to be concluded , i totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .this approach would be more beneficial to the students in order to encounter and survive in this competitive world .
