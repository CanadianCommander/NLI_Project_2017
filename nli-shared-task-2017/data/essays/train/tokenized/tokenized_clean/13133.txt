in my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to to well .i agree with this idea .because , successful people have good personality and they trust theirself .they are creative people who want to do new things everytime .they want to take risks to create new things .this is well known reality for them .everyone know this .this is also one of the chracteristic situation for these people .if a person want to be successful , he or she should very hard , he or she has good personality and as a result of this he or she can be succesful .this is the best way to be a successful person .firstly , i want say that people do many things in their life , always , they live traditionally .they have basic rules in their life .they do nt do new things .but on the other hand , some people work very hard in their life .they have good personality and they are very creative for everything .this is the basic charecteristic for them .they get bored in normal life .they have best emotions to do new things .so that they go from different ways of life .i mean that they take o lot of risk while they are walking on this road .for instance , my best friend tom is ver successful life .i have known him a long time ago .when he ten years old , he did nt like to watch tv .he use to read everytime .after two five years , he went to america for best education .he was saying that `` i should take risk my education , i should go america for my education .this is the best way in my life `` he toke risk .because he was teenage and whe he went to americahe was alone there .now after twenty years , he is assistance of a professor in the english class at a universtiy .he spent very much time to be a academic carreer .he tried different way to do it .and he has taken some risksin conlusion , successfur people try new things .this is basic charecter for them .an additionally , this is the well known reality .
