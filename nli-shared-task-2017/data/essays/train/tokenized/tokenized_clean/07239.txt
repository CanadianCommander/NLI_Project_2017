according to me successful people try new things and take risks .if someone wants to be good at anything , he has to do something original .original things take attention and people care about them for instance , let s assume a group of students working on synthesizing a chemical compound that can be used as a drug for cancer .every student works on the synthesis without asking or questioning whether this compound is experienced before or analyzed in a laboratory .in this case , if a student wants to analyze , this will differ him from the others .this one asks the work and thinks the consequences of this synthesis and also questions whther it will be used practically .the compound can not be used because of its structure or may not have the specialities to be used as a drug .in spite of the fact that , questioning either the situations in which people are or the works which people do , provides some one to improve himself .as in this example , the student who wants to analyse , besides synthesis , may learn about the analyzing methods .this a simple purpose for improving himself .from another aspect , everone can not take risks easily .generally people are afraid of the consequenses .but on the other hand , by evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of a new way ( a new route to synthesis for instance ) or a different solution to a problem , may result sufficiently .so trying another synthesis route may have risks .due to the fact that , the chemicals are difficult and dangerous to deal with , chemical reactions shoul be considered very carefully .but with a good research a student can change the way of synthesis .finally , people have risks all the time in life .to be succesful , people should take risks with cryticisizing every aspect .in addition to that , questioning leads to learn more .in today s world , the more knowledge , the more success .competition in every area force people to take risks and to improve themselves to survive .in order to live in better conditions , people should try new things .unless they ` regenerate  themselves , life can not be a place to live , to survive .
