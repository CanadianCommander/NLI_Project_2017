i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people is younger than old people and i think young people are teenagers to about 20 year-old-people .teenagers have very healthy bodies .so they can go many different places .if they have many trips , and camp , they will experience many precious memories .maybe they will experience with their friends and families .also they can make freinds in the camps .but old people ca nt do that .they are maybe 50 to 70 year-old-people .so most old people have some disease in their knees and shoulders .their healthy also very bad .some old people also do nt have friends except their neighborhood .if he or she is very healthy , they do nt have much money .they ca nt go trips for other countries .young people have lots of dreams .so they can enjoy their life .they can be singer , teacher , doctor , and actor ( actress ) .they will try their best .it is very important .dream is make people alive .in the world , every teenagers have dream , and they make their ways .however , most old people do nt have dreams .some pool old people is waiting only death .they are so pity .if they have dreams and hope , they can heal their diseases .i believe it .if someone does nt have any goals or dreams , he will be fail and pool .i also have dreams , i will be oriental doctor , because in the chaina , some doctor revive a man by his oriental medicine .i think it will have dreams to revive man .old people can enjoy their life , too .but it is less than young people .young peopl can have many memories , healthy bodies , and friends .also they have lots of dreams .so i think young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
