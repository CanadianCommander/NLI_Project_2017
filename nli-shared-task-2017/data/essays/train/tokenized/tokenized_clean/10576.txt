i agree with this statement .here is my explanation why and how i beleive so .successful people do not quantify their success by where they currently are in their lives .they constantly strive to acheive more than what is normally possible .they have a desire to constantly excel and acheive a higher level at anything they do .once the next level is reached that does not satisfy them , they continue to charge along to the next possible level .often times this involves taking risks in situation that has never been either tried or known .these individually have a special knack of pushing the bar to the next level and changing ` status quo  .this does not mean they do not fail but they do not take failure to be the end .they are quick learners and are able to adapt and identify new ways to approach a tough problem .one key characterisitc of a successful person is that they are innovators .there are world-wide examples of innovators like thomas edison , bill gates etc .they are never afraids to venture in to the unknown or take risks .and because they do so they are often goal-driven and do not give up until they get to a solution .this allows them to develop and test new concepts by mastering the well known ones .they understand the difference between doing things well versus exceptional .their ` out of the box  ideas provides them the opportunities to create solutions that others would not think of .but it is not just the thoughts of great ideas , it s their ability to work dilegently and having the tenacity to survive all odds to execute on those ideas that helps them produce results .this is what differentiates them from others .successful people do not think their current place in life defines their future .they know being successful in life means staying in the game , never giving-up and treating it as a marathon not a race !
