well , i agree with the following statement that successful people always would want to try new things taking all the risks involved in doing so .it s a common sense to understand the point cause people who are successful and well experienced in whichever field they are would want to try and explore new things for their benefit .for example , successful businessman would nt hesitate to take the risks of establishing a new firm or company caused he already knows what s involved to built a company .and even if it turns out to be a failure , he would nt have much problem to start all over again with all the financial backing and the knowledge and expertise that he has .likewise , famous singers known for their songs and music quality try and incorporate new kind of sounds and technics to make it different and interseting for their fans .so , yes successful people al ways have better chnan .e
