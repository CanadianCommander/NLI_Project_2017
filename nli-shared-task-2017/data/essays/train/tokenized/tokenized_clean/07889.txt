when learning a specific subject in school , students are required not only to know the information regarding the subject but also to understand the concepts implied .these two aspects are very differnt and require differnt abilities from students .though it is important to know the facts for a subject , it is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts in order to have a thourough understanding of the topic .first of all , simply memorizing facts does not imply knowing the topic .if a student does so , she is just regurgitating what she has read or heard which does nt mean she knows what she has learned .on the other hand if a studen understands the concepts and ideas related to the topic , then he understands the implications as well as the uses of the topic .for example in history , though it is often precieved as a subject which merely requires memorizing , a student needs to understand the concepts in order to full appreciate the subject .merely memorizing dates and occurences does not offer real insight as to why certain events occur and what effects these events could have on our present society .furthermore , understanding concepts as opposed to just learning facts allows a student to deal with any type of question .a student that has only learned facts will be expecting questions that ask him to answer with the facts he has learned .if a question deals with a deviation of these facts , then the student would not be able to adequatly ansewer the question .a student on the other hand , who understands the concepts implied would be able to use her procces of induction and deduction to come to logical answer .i , personaly , have come across such dilema in a physics test .the question i found on the test , dealt with a concept that we had not read or discussed previously in class .fortunatly , i had a good understanding of the concepts and ideas involved wich allowed me to derive the appropriate formula that was required for the test .finally , understanding concepts and ideas , allows a student to retain the subject and topic for a longer time .a student who memorizes facts is more likely to forget these once the test or examination is finished , so that the knowledge is thus not aquired .for a student who does understand the concepts , though she may forget the facts in the future , but she will still be able to think the process logicaly and come to a conclusion that would be adequate .
