in my opinion it is better to have specialized knowledge in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academec subjects .a person having a broad and superficial knowledge of many academic subjects is like a jack of all trades but master of none .such a person can not do justice to any of the academic subjects .like for example no patient will like his brain to be operated upon by a general physician rather than by a neuro-surgeon .similarly a teacher teaching a variety of subjects can not do justice to students of a specific stream .he might be aware of all the subjects he is teaching but he might not be well equipped to satisfy the queries of a student regarding the specifications of a topic .it is advised to have an overall knowledge of various subjects and be aware of all the things which is why we as a student study a variety of subjects at school level .but then it is even more important to give a direction to the course of our studies by pursuing further education in a field of our interest so that we do proper justice to our studies .a student might not be as interested in studying literature as he might be in engineering sciences or vice-versa .so it is kind of unfair to make him study subjects that do not interest him which ultimately leads to his securing poor grades in those subjects .one may very well argue that a student may be interested in more than one subject and may want to pursue his further studies in both .in that case , now-a-days there are many combinations of subjects available which help us in understanding the inter relationship of different subjects with each other .for instance , the application of engineering sciences in medical stream is one of the most studied combination .by the time a student completes his schooling he is in a condition to make up his mind and decide his areas of interest .so giving him a choice then to choose his preferred stream will help him perform well and hence will lead to his motivation and satisfaction .moreover , there are numerous fields which require exhaustive research and study for their proper understanding and appreciation .a student whose faculty are being used in a variety of subjects will not be able to find enough time and resources to utilise in all the fields .hence he might not be able to appreciate the nuances of a subject as well as he could have when studying that subject in detail .in view of the above arguments i believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
