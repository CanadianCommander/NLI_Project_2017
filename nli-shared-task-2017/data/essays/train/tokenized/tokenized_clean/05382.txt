i have been a student in an education system , which gives importance on learning facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts , for 16 years in my country .therefore , i have the ability as a student to discuss on the advantages and disadvantages of learning facts .on the other hand , i will mention about the significancy of understanding the ideas and concepts basing on my knowladge rather than my experince .in my education life , i have learned so many facts especially in my biology lessons .learning facts are necessary for a student in order to extend his or her knowladge , however , memorazing is not a good way of learning facts since you forget them in time partly or completely if you do not study again .for example , i do not remember some of the facts that i have learned in my high school about biology .in addition , learning facts without understanding them takes too much time since you try to learn a new thing that you have no idea .in this case , as the time you study increases you get bored and usually stop studying .moreover , learning facts only also diminishes your creativity .when you memorize the facts and then do well in the exam , you do not even think the rest of the fact such as ; what is the behind this fact or how this fact is related to other fact .understanding ideas and concepts rather than learning facts is a second way to study .firstly , understanding a topic completely is a time saving method since you can guess on the methods that have nearly same working principle .furthermore , understanding ideas makes you feel confident before the exam , yet you can use your mind and find the answer though you do not know the topic totally .to illustrate , in my machine elements class , although i had not studied the helical springs , i could have find the answer by using my knowladge on the linear springs .as i have mentioned before , i have learned too many facts up to now in my student life .however , i have come to the conclusion that understanding ideas is better .
