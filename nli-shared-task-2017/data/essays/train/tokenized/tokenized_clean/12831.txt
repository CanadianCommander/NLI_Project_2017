i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i think the trip will be well-planned , enjoyable , and economical in this way .a tour guide usually knows the resort well .therefore , he or she most likely has a good plan of where to visit , where to eat , where to take pictures , and where to stay for the nights .i went to the niagara falls in a group led by a tour guide .the guide talked about the history and formation of the falls on the bus .we stopped at a small and good restaurant for lunch .in the afternoon , he took us directly to the best spots of views .i did not spent any time looking up a map and figuring out where to go .it is enjoyable to travel with a group led by a tour guide .we can talk on the way .we can also make friends with each other .we can help each other when needed .when i went to the smoky mountain last summer , we were talking and singing on the bus .it was one of the best memories of my vacation .it is also economical to travel with a group led by a tour guide .people can share the expenses of renting a bus or a car .they can share the expenses on gas and tolls as well .sometimes it is cheaper to buy bulk tickets than to buy each ticket individually .for example , if a ticket costs twenty dollars for one , it might only cost fifteen dollars each if you buy ten of them at the same time .these are the reasons why i think it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
