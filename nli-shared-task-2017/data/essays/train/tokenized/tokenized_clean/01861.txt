a broad knowledge is very important in human being because it permits to have a general background off many things that involve our life .in my opinion a broad knowledge should be the first thing that we have to reach .after this , we can specialize in the specific subjet that we prefer .i also think that we ca nt choose our way without knowing several subjects , because it is very difficult to know what we like whitout trying it .this is also the way that the school is organized .during our first years of school we study general themes such as history , literature , mathematics etc. that give us a wide formation .when we continue our studies we more and more specialize in a subject .in fact at university there are a lot of specific subjects and lack of general ones .i think that this is well done because today the jobs are very specialized and industry for example need specialized people to reach some important projects .i can give an example of my university : i study engineering and in i saw that a project always involves a lot of aspects of studying , so it s very important another important point is that today s work is often organized in teams composed by various specialized people .these teams can surely do something more because anyone gives his better qualitys .but we can forget that the general things learnt in first years of school form us like men outside the job .a general known is important in everyday life .in conclusion i think that is very important have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subjects but this have to be the start point for specialize in what we love .and first of all we always have to remember that we will never finish to learn !
