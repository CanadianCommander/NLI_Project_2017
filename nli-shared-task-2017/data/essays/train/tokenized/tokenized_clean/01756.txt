i agree that young people enjoy life than old people .this agreement is based entirly on my own experience and common sense .to demostrate what i believe , i would like to state some views here .everytime when i meet young people , i feel an air of freedom .they may be presumptuous or fatuous , or even ill-mannered , but they are never anxious social climbers .they may have little knowledge or even non-educated , but they have desires to explor the new world .unlike the old one who lives and thinks via his early learning , and stopped there .all these can be defined by the air of freedom that leads the youth to be higher , stronger and faster in order to enjoy their lives more than old people .another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth .because of the limitation by age , the old lose lots of enjoyable things .they may be rich and healthy , but they do not have interests to nice food ; they can buy a great varity of clothes , but they do not have good look .apart from their elders , the young take advantage of a nice age .no matter what clothes they put on , they seem to be active and handsome .they do not need to worry about the blood prssure while taking delicious pizzar or other fast food .life begins with good food .in conclusion , i admit that there are negative ponits to young people .the fear of unemployment , hard work , scarce resource , consist it .but they are lucky for the youth .
