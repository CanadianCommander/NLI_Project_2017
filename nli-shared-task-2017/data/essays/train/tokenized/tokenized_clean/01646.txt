i m agree and i hope that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .today the use of car is more extended and ofthe it s do nt have a real fundation .in fact , even is true that the lifestyle is more different by the lifestyle in the past century , even if people have more need and more activities to do , for exemple jobs , sports activities , social events ect .. , is also tru that more people wouldt have problem and private themselves of own confortability .for exemple analize a tipical family composed by five person , who are father , mather , first son of eighteen years an second soon of five years .in a family of five person , today is nt a surprise have four car !why ?one car for the father , he use own car to going job , and when he have finished to work he going at the gym .another car is for the mammy , who use own car to going with the second sons to the school and then she will go to work .another car is for the first son , who have own car for own personal need , like going to the school , to the cinema or going to the gym .all of over said is possible with one car !maybe is necessary get up early in the morning and spend more time across the street , or in the traffic , but in this way you will have the opportunity to spend more time with own family , you can say a fact or an experience of day .morover you can resolve a big problem of modern societies .the destruction of natural sistem .is more important to save the development and the grow of the word , save and protect the nature by the smog and more other complex problem , suc as serra effect , sea polluted , air unbreath , ect .reducing the number of car for each person , or using public trasportation , such as metro , bus or a lot of services wich you can use , you will reduce the traffic and so also the smog and you will have in the future more healthy for you and your family .
