this question has two answers for me , because i agree and disagree at the same time .i will first tell you why i think it is better to be specialized on one subject , and then i will explain to you why for me you gain more by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first of all i have to say that if you know a lot about a great deal of subject you can not be a specialist in one subject .you can talk about a lot of thinks , but you will keep on talking about the basics of those thinks .you would not be able to go deep into a conversation .however on the other hand i think it is more interesting to learn about different topics .i do not think your brain is limited to a number of knowledge , so for me it is always good to learn new things .the more you know about things , the more you are open minded .i personaly think it is very important to be open minded , because then you become more tolerant , and you accept more , and learn more again .if you know a large range of things , you are also able to talk about more things , so you are not left over on certain conversations .in my opinion it is very important to be curious , to discover and to experiment a lot of things .the more you do , the more you learn , and life become more interesting .however it is also necessary to be specialised in one subject .when you are specialised you become more precise , and you can go deeper into the subject , it become more interesting than to stay on the basics of one subject .like everything in life it is a question of balance .
