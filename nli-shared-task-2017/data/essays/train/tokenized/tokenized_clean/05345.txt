it is hard to predict the number of cars after twenty years .as we can see that the technology is emerging greatly .we can assure this much that the public transport will be improved in coming years .but also considering the fact that most of the people are working and earning good , they prefer to keep their own transport vehicle .technology improvement confirm that public transport like metro train , delux buses provide convinent transport to many people .most of the people from middle class or lower class prefer to travel by means of this transport and save their money over the high rate petrol or desiel .if government keep on providing this high technology transport or some better transport than we can hope some decline in the number of car present .now a days many of the people are having satisfying jobs .this increase in employment give a hint that most of the people will going to have a good salary in future .this kind of people will not worry about spending money on petrol or buying a car .cars have become a status symbol for many high class people .also the low rate of cars are also attracting the public of middle class .if the rate of cars keep on decreasing than there will be a chance that in coming future there will be nothing but the cars on the road .it depend on the government to increase or decrease the number of cars .if government will provide the low rate and more convenient public transport than the normal human being will prefer to take the advantage of high quality transportation syatem .but government need to keep a check on the rates and stock of car which come in the market .also an individual need to understand that whether the car is his real requirement or just a piece to show in public .keeping an account on this point we can hope for a better futur with less number of cars .
