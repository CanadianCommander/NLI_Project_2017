my education life changes totally in the university .at the high school , students are educated smoothly about the lessons .teachers ignore to provide the facts of the subjects , and teachers explain the lessons only about understanding ideas and memorizing the dates .especially in the history lesson that is very important to understand and learn facts .student should describe the history on his or her aspect .in my opinion the most important point of education is that education is provided with its facts .the first point i would like to make is that learning subjects with its facts is exciting .for instance history ; in my country there was a great leader who is mustafa kemal ataturk .i heard too many things about him during all my educational life .but at the university , students learn all facts about his life .therefore i wonder about him and why he dedicated his all life for turkish nation , so that i am excited and wonder , then i investigate about him .the second point i would like to make is that learning subjects with its facts is effective way of understanding .without clear and real reasons any subject , especially history , could not be understandable .it is the efficient way of education makes events clear with all its facts .thus i would conclude by saying that learn facts of the subject provides exciting and interesting in subject , furthermore learn facts make people understandable and more concerning to subject .
