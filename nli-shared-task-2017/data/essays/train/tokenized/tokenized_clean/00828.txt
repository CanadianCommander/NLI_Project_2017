i would like to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however as far as i am concerned , this is very unlikely to happen .the only solid argument that i can find to defend the reduction in the number of cars is that due to the lack of gas and consequently the increase in its cost , people will buy less cars .nevertheless , people are so used to have a car that in my opinion it is more probable that we will move to electric cars .furthermore , what would happen with the big car manufacturers ?i think that they would find ways to keep people buying cars .another fact that we have to take into account , is the growth of cities .things are further and further nowadays and there are few policies trying to increase the use of public transportation .therefore the use of car becomes very important .it is also relevant to measure what cars imply .they are an evidence of economic power and they provide independence , a feeling of freedom .are people going to renounce to those feelings ?honestly , i do not think that teenagers are going to reject their only source of independence .the same way people in their fifties will keep buying sports cars .those are traditions that have become too relevant in our society to be changed in only twenty years .what about the new powerful countries like china ?as the salaries increase people tends to consume more .china is a new market willing to buy more and more cars as its citizens can afford them .for all the reasons sated above such as , the power of big manufacturers , the new demand in countries like china , and the role that cars currently play in our society , i do no think that things will change in twenty years .
