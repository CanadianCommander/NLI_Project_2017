whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject depends on the range and variety of academic subjects .in my opinion , to be a specialist in one subject would prove to be more advantageous than to be competent in various fields .the main reason for my view is that to specialize in one subject would mean that the person becomes a pioneer in that field .he would be qualified to make contributions to his chosen field .for example , when a person specializes in civil engineering , he would become a qualified person to speak on the topic and to offer his services to the public .to major in one subject would mean that the person would be empowered to forsee changes and paradigm shifts , that could be for the better or worse , in the field .if for the worse , he would be in a position to make a positice difference .another reason for my view is that , a fully qualified professional would be able to engage himself in high-end research thereby enabling him to make technological advances .some may say that to be a competent speaker on varied topics would enable a person to have a farther reach and bigger sphere of influence .yet , it has to be acknowledged that a man who is a specialist in a field will be able to make a stronger influence on those around him .others might cite that to specialize in one field would be to limit a person s perspective .however , a specialist in a field would not only have a good perspective but also a vision .this vision would enable him to achieve an envisioned goal .specifically , it has to be stated that to set and achieve goals , a person would have to be a specialist in the field .for instance , only a qualified electronics engineer would be able to improve the satellite communication techniques and not a newspaper editor , who would be competent to speak on varied subjects .admittedly , if the person wishes to enter another field to enhance his knowledge , his oppurtunities would be limited considering his poor prior knowledge .but the upside is that there is rarely a dearth in demand for specialists in a field .to be a pioneer in his chosen field would enable the person to mentor budding people and to guide others and hence contributing back to the people .in conclusion , to specialize in one subject would be more benefical , not only to the person but also to the community .i would agree that having varied interests is beneficial but on balance , this should be supported by a mastery in one subject .
