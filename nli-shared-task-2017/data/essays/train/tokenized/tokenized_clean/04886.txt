ya , i definately agree with this statement .particularly i believe that , the sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in this aspect , a sucessful people mean that , they already familiar with most of the issues .they mostly concentrate mainly on new inventions or new things to show that or to prove that they are also good in all the subjects or things .that too , the selected thing mostly will have greater risks and fluctuations .but , his/her sucess mainly depends on acheiving the selected thing or goal .in my view the sucess in any person hides mainly in selecting the new intersting thing and the way he/she acheives it .even if he/she fails in trying new thing , they will be well known that , the method he/she adopted is a wrong one , and he tries for the another .and i strongly believe that , mostly sucessful person try new things rather what he/she already know how to do it well .right ?if the same known thing happened to do repeatedly , he / she may get sucess in that particular thing only , and he/she connot try a new thing .in this senario , how can one think that he/she is a sucessful person .and i strongly disagree with the statement that , successful people do or attempt old things what they alredy know how to do it well .the sucess in trying new thigs and acheiving them , proves him a more successfull person than before .getting sucess in new things that are risky proves him/her a lot as a successful person rather in successing the same in a well known thing and which is not risky .let us consider with an example , now we all well aware that , thomas edison has invented electric bulb .he adopted several experiments in the procee of invention of electric bulb .earlier all of his experiments are failures .but , atlast he succeed in his invention and also learns that all his failures are the wrong methods that shaould
