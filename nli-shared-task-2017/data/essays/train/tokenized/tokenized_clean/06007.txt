the humankind always need to education therefore education is the very important aspect of human life to reach high life standards .ideas and concepts are most important part of education .some assumed that it is the most important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in controray to this some think that the best for the students to learn facts .i totally agree with the first idea .these are my following reasons .the first reason for my belief is that , the students must learn the ideas first .because the ideas are important and also the concepts .students must give pay attention the ideas and concepts than the facts .if a students learn the ideas and the concepts the student can learn the facts by time .the second reason for my belief is that , the facts are not important exactly .because the ideas make the shape to the facts .so the its concept is important so it is related with the ideas .if the student learn the ideas first he or she can prepare the fact before and he or she can look the fact in different ways .this is the important .in the other hand the facts are the important some times to look the objects truely .some think and say this students must learn facts first to prevent him or her to the lies .for all these reasons i therefore believe that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .this idea is related with both give a shape to facts and prepare to the facts before .the long and the short of it is that the ideas and the concepts are more important than facts .i hope the students do nt disregard what i mentioned !
