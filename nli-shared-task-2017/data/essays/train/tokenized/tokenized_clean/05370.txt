i agree with it .nowadays young people are changing .they just think about them selves .internet and minings are changing so made them to think about them selves .why i said internet makes us change is , in internet we are allowed to do everything and have own worlds .we have own hompies blogs so we can get happiness from decorating thosese , and watching what they made .in internet nobody cares , no one know who i am , so we can do whatever we want .consequently we ca nt think about others , because we have many things to do for them selves .so we dont give times time to helping their communities .but i thing helping their communities are more vaulable then decorating , or having fun in unreal world .i think we should get more interst in communicates .
