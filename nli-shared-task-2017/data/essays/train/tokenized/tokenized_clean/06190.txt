the question of wheter we should have general knowledge of many academic areas than specific knowledge in just one area is interesting one .of course , there is no simple answer to this problem .however , personally , i think that we have to take broad knowledge from many subjects .firstly , general knowledge is connected with total context of science .in spite that we have very good specific knowledge in one subject , if we do not understand the role and value of that knowledge in the science , we can not use that understanding or skill freely .secondly , it means helpful for explaining to people that academist have a lot of knowlege without his or her major .for example , if he or she is not only specialist but also person who have many understanding other topics , that person can explain the academic knowledge to use many interesting examples .this fact makes us understand that having various broad knowledge help to realize and solve the difficult problem to ordinary people .finally , that academist can explain the complexed quetion easily by using a lot of examples form his broad knowledge points out the possibility of inter-academic communication .one example of this is the subject of cultural studies in u.k . .sometimes , the scientist of this area have many knowlege to sociology , and there is very good explain in university .therefore , i agree that it is better to take general knowledge of lots of academic areas than to specialize in one specific area .as i see it ,
