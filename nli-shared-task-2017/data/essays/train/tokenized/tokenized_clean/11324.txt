i agree with the opnion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects for the following reasons .first , having broad knowlege of many academic subjects is more convient .for example , in 1995 when i was junior in tokyo university in tokyo japan , i studied law and tax .one day , when i and my friends were researching for bank law , i were confusing with the law .one of my friend , tanaka , is the best student studied economy and had a lot of knowledge of bank system .he helped me .i were able to learn a lot of thing about the bank law .as the example shows that having broad knowelege of many academic is more convient .second , to have variety of academic subjects is more fun .for example , in 1996 when i worked part-time at a private school , i taught japanese history .i taught japanese history , law and tax in the historiacl class .children in my class were interested in social sytem .they asked me a lot of question about history , law and tax .some of children wanted to study law .i had good time in my lecture .this experience clearly shows that having broad knowelge of many acadmeic subjects make me fun and brings me good time .thus , i definitely agree with the opnion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specializing in one specific subject .
