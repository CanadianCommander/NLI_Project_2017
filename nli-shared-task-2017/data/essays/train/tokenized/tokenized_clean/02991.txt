of course many people might think , that the youth has become more egoistic and at a certain point i agree with that .if you take a look on the big cities , you see everyone living on his own , maybe additionally caring about his parents and his girlfriend , but that is all .in my opinion this is just an brief impression .if you take a deeper look , you would find out , that there are still a lot of beneficial clubs , who do spend time helping the community even without being paid .and that s why i think the situation has not changed in the recent years , there are just more youths living in the cities and the people tend to see only that ones , that do not care .especially in smaller towns , there are a lot of young people , who want to help others for example in sport clubs or at church .i know a lot of people at my age , who are interested in these things .concerning myself , i am member in the football club in my town , where i do the train for almost 20 kids together with a friend .sometimes this is very hard and exhausting , but it is just such a fantastic feeling to do something for the kids .especially because i know , how i appreciated the football train the time i was in their age .moreover i am also member of a youth group , that belongs to the church .with this group we often organize trips for younger members to the zoo or bike-tours .once a year we have a one-week camp , sleeping in tents .this is really exciting , because instead of shopping or watching tv , we are singing or playing games in the nature , which is really something totally different from the dayly life .sometimes we also organize something for the older people in our town , like drinking coffee or playing cards .in my opinion there is nothing better than a simple `` thank you  or even just a smile on the face of a young boy or girl .so in addition , especially in smaller cities or towns there are still young people , who are encouraged in helping others .
