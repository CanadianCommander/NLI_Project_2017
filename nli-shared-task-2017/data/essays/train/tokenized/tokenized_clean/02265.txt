there is no single day without a new commercial with medicine or food that could help the elderly people to keep fit in their bodies and young in their mind .we are now surrounded by the eternal youthness quest .but why ?do young people really enjoy life more than the older people do ?we first have to acknowlegde that the general trend conforts this idea .we easily can find the reasons for it : - from a physical point of view , it makes no doubts that young people have the advantage of their age . ..and their bodies .they can , for sure , do more physical efforts than the elderly people .in this way , not all physical activities are opened to seniors .eg : attractions in an entertainment park .- generally , the young people are studying , and therefore have commonly more free time than working people for instance .eg : school holidays .this time , being larger , can be alloted to more activities than for the other category .- an important fact is that most of young people do not have to care for kids yet , and do not have the charge of a family .consquently , they can enjoy life more than other people , since they do not have such preoccupations .from another point of view , this general trend is new : it only makes a while that people get to 70 , 80 or even 100 years old .3 or 4 generations before us , it was uncommon !therefore , the idea of old people was the idea of people staying in a rocking chair , waiting for lunch , having strict scheddule . ..it s not the case anymore : many older people enjoy life , go to their activities , go out with their friends , and love it !another fact is that what young people could find enjoyable is not enjoyable to everyone .it creates then another point of view .there are pros and cons about this topic .and i have to say that i am totally divised on this subject .i do nt think there is a yes-no answer , but more a general one which i expressed .
