the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .in my opinion , that s not true .traveling by a group which is led by a tour guide will might be a good trip .you do nt have to reserve a hotel or restraunt , and you do nt have to plan almost everything .but , i think thatthere is a mistake on here .choosing hotel , restsaunt , country , where you going to go . ..everything is fun and called `` trip  .also we have to remember is , guide company could maybe make mistakes .so your tour could be destroyed by guide company .these are the reasons why i disagree with this question .
