i strongly speak in favour of `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .although older people who are successful in achieving their gaols and retired they always think to go back to their young age and still wants to enjoy their lives .the following sentences and examples will further support my view .the younger people have always in a motivation to achieve their joy .they have the spiritual power and physical strength to reach their enjoyment .as they have nt seen the world as much as old people do they always look for some new ideas and try to enjoy in what ever they did as its their new experience .even though young age is the time to decide about their future they always take it as a challenge and try to build their way to sucess .a person always wants to hide their age and feeling of getting old to make themselves look younger .i want to mention about an experience in my life .i happen to meet a really good old couple who adopted me as their daughter .i remeber asking them whether they like their old age or their younger life , they answered me like this `` we are not old by our heart , its only for our physical appearance  and they always wants to go back to their younger life and wants to enjoy more than what they did .they even encouraged me by saying that young age is the only time where you can enjoy up to the maximum and after that you will have lots of responsibilities to do .on an all a person will get old in the near future but never can come back to their young age .i always wants to go to my child hood days and play alot with innocent mind .so every stage in our life has its own experience and enjoyment where we want to go back to experience it again .all of these stages young age is the best age to enjoy your life so i will enjoy my teenage life now .
