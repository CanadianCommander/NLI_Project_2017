broad knowledge versus specif knowledge is one of the most important issue in the academic world and during the job experience .maybe it depends on the lefe phase one is involving in , but definetly specialization is the final aim to get as principle in styding and then in workingfirst , during education year all students , from primary school to universtity , collect a lot of improving informations .improving informations are informations usefull to improve your capability to understand the next step of a process .in education all student follow this process of improving to finally own knowledge enough to afford all situations , in particular knowledge about subjects that are , as math and history for instance , necessary to understand all patterns in all situations in job and private life .but after that it will be natural to spend the knowledge collected in some particular field .so , specialization naturally occurs .in the primary everybody study the same .in high school it is possible to follow an emphasis about science , human , art , etc . .in the first 3 year of university the student will study a specific field , for example business and admistration , and in the following 2 last year the student will be able to choose an specific subject of business and administration in which he will go through to learn , finally , a job .if it is considered acedemic career , so it will be not so important to get a spcialization till the last step , but usually the job world requires specialized skills .so education has to be an enabler of specialization in terms of skills created for the replacement post universitysecond , job life .all companies have a lot of functions in the organizational structure .and inside these functions there are a lot of complex activities to do .so , it usually is required workers with specific knowledge about a company process , for example .because operational complexity in terms of process needs specialization of skills required of the people involved in the process .so , it will be better if all the functions of a company have the majority of the workers involved in specific tasks using and imporving specific skills and some managers who concern aboutn the conjuctions and the relations between functions , but also they specialized in some relations , not all of relationsfinally , education has the responsibility the enable the passage from the study world to the job world introducing specialization constantly in the studying path .this is fundamental to permit the student to jump directy in the job world where specialization in a field is required to get easier a job
