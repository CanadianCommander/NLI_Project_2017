recently , many students try to find an effective and efficient way to study , but they are always confused by the dilema : understanding ideas is the first priority or learning facts is more important ?from my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts other than learning facts .and this can be fully explained from three aspects : first , nowdays people have more access to those facts so they do nt have to memorize them ; second , understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable ; third , understanding helps students to develop creativity , which is the key force in this technology world .first of all , facts are easy to be found .nowadays people have a variety of ways to acquire data and information .books , magazines , internet , video tapes are all the powerful resources which help students to learn facts .for example , a student can easily get what happened in canada in 1870 from the internet , he or she just simply type : `` what happened in canada in 1870  , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .moveover , the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before , so what is the point to try to memorize all the terms and fact ?it is a waste of time obviously .second , understanding is more important to get ideas .it is better to teach a man fishing skills other than just give him fishes everyday .for example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do nt know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time i give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ?  , you still do nt know how to do it .on the other hand , if you know the rule of addition , that s much enough .you do nt have to memorize any facts such as `` 1 + 56 = 57  , you can do any addition questions .that simple .last but not least , understanding helps students to be more creative .as we know , this is a technology era , creativity seems more important than just accepting .in order to understand , a student has to push himself thinking in a deep level , which helps to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skills .the more a person thinks , the more knowledgable he or she tend to be .hence , he or she will understand more and be more creative .this is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation .in conclusion , learning facts is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential .understanding ideas can let students be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing facts is just a waste of time .so it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
