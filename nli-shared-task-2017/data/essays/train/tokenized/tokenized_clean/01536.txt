i do nt think youg people enjoy their life more than older ones , although most of them think so .i like to give short examples why young peoples think in this directions and than show it from the opposite side of the elders :most of the young people think they are enjoying their live more than older ones because there are so many new experiences they are making when they are young , for example finding a girlfriend .they are talking all the time about how happy they are .but after a while they search for a new girlfriend maybe because the `` old one  was nt exactly what they expected of the `` true love  .older people instead of this already have the experience what they want or what they are searching for in life , so , when they finally find the right partner they stick together and stay together happier and longer then young people , because they know , that they wo nt have their whole life again to cherrish it with the person they love .and they do nt talk about how happy they are all the time , they just enjoy it more silently .secondly young people say , that they could nt imagine a life without a computer or the television .for them , these things make live more enjoyable .they do nt understand how old persons could be happy without using these things .but older persons grew up without knowing things like that , so they never made the experience of tv or cumputers .they had other things to pass their freetime with .they played outside or read a book .and because they did nt know these things they were not unhappy by not having these things .so , i think it is definetly not true that younger persons have more fun in life or that they enjoy it more than older ones .both of them enjoy their lives but in different ways .but , i , for myself have got to say , that i definetly do nt want to live in another century or that i want to change my age .
