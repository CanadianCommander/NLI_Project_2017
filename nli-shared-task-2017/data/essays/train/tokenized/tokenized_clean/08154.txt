some people thinks that yong people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .but , in my view , i think young people nowadys do not give time to helping their communities , because of three reasons as follows .first , i think young people nowadays have a tendancy to dislike thier communities .perhaps the best example to illustlate this point is that when i , member of comunitie festival , wanted to have a meeting in the city center for preperation of festival , and call the member of my community , only seldom yong people assembeled .most person are elderly person which do nt enogh power to do the job .in other day , when i happened to meet one yong person in my community , i heard the reason why he did nt come the meeting .his answer was so simple that i ca nt tell anyting - he dislike such a meeting because it is boring .what is more , i think yong people nowadays have a lot of things to do , compared to the people 20 years ago .for instance , waching tv , playing video games and using a computer and so on .what is worse , to spend the time in doing these things , yong people nawadays have little time to commucate with thier family .and as aconsequence , they also do nt have time to communicate with the person in their community .nor helping their communities .third , comunity power itself come to weeken its power these days .long time ago , community play a important roll in keeping its sequrity .but , these day , i think comunity fanction itself is weeken thesedays with the progress of civilazation .therefore , i think young people nowadys do not give time to helping their communities , because they have tendancy to dislike their communities , they have a lot of things to do , and community itself come to weeken its power .
