people specialize in certain subjects because of many reasons , few of them may be person s personal interest in that field , some times requirements are such that people have to specialize in certain subjects for good of other people for example specialization in heart surgery .but its not always necessary to specialize in subjects .people can learn and read many academic subjects as they like , but it has its own positive and negative sides .but still according to me people should choose variety of subjects due to many possible reasons .firstly , many academic subjects provide people with broader way of thinking .by choosing various academic subjects people can actually enhance and diversify their think tank .they can use experiences of one subject to understand the other .variety of subjects can increase thier level of understanding in other areas also .for example while studying for mechanical engines , students should also understand the chemical reactions taking place inside the engines and how they affect the working of engines .this can only happen if they have enough information regarding chemical reactions inside the engine .secondly , by opting variety of subjects to study , students can become versatile .they can view this world with wider range of options and with wider prospective .for instance students may not face problems while applying for different types of jobs .they can opt from variety of jobs available in the market in different fields .additionaly they can switch their careers later , if they want to , to try different jobs if they get bored from the previous one .admittedly certain jobs do require specialization in some fields , for instance technical jobs requiring surgery of particular body parts .however people with diverse experience in various subjects are well respected and are very highly valued by the companies in the society .therefore i conclude that by studying various academic subjects people can really enhance their knowledge and can be a great value and asset to a company in which they are working .
