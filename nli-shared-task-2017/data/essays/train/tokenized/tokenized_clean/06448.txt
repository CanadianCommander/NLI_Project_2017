some people probably would like to dream with the idea that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .even though i would be one of them , i can see the reality of the situation .because of economy importance , individualsim of people , bad public transport system and no better obiton than a car ; i desagree with the earlier mentioned statement .the car production has a huge importance in the economy of many countries and the world .countries like japan , taiwan and china , a big part of their economy relay each year of car production and at the same time many people in the world has their main incomst from selling carrs .since car production is economically important in the life of many people , its production will not stop and sertainly not in twenty years .people tend to be individualist and usually preffers to think about his own conviniencea and there for people prefers to have its own car insted of using public transportation .this causes that a big and an increasing amount of cars are been sold each year , and there for a bigger amount of cars will also be produced in the twenty coming years .there are not too many countries that choose to invest in public transportation .public transportation is usually in bad conditions , wich makes very atractive for people to use their money in buying cars , wich will cause an increase in the car production in the coming years .
