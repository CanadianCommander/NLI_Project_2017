when you are visitng a new country for first times , it s usual that you do nt know the principal and interesting touristic points , even in citys like paris , where are places like the eiffel tower and the louvre museum , there s differentes places to visit and know .in this case , i think that the best way to travel is un a group led by a tour guide .first of all , a tour guide knows the whole city , and he/she can tell us a lot o interesting information of the places tha we are going to visit , for example , in the winter of last year , i went to canada with my family , it was the first time , and we traveled in a group with a tour guide .when we were in quebec , joan ( the guide s name ) , took us to a place in where we can walk in the snow for a long time ( it was a hughe forest ) , and we can travel withs dogs , like the skimals in the north pole .that kind of places are nt known by common or foreign people , and we cant share and enjoy that new experience with the whole group .in other words , theres a lot of advantages traveling with a tour guide , another example , last week i went to acapulco beach , in mexico , i love that place , i know `` all  the interest places , restaurants , bars , popular beaches , because i travel to acapluco since i was a kid .but , two days ago , i was talking with my friend s sister , who is a tour guide , and when i was talking about my travel to acapulco , and talking about those interests places , she asked to me about `` laguna de chacagua  , chacaguas lagoon in english , and `` barra vieja beach  , and a few more places , i was surprised because i know acapulco very well , but y didt heard about that places ever .and i said to her tha i would like to know that part of hidden acapulco .for that reasons , i think that travel with a group led by a tour guide is the best option for new places and known places .
