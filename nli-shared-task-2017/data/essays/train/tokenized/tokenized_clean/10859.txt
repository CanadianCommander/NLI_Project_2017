it seems that because of young ages and so more flexible bodies young people are enjoying life more than their parents or older people around them do .it may be so , technically , but in fact not , at least not from what i have learned from my experiences .first of all , young people are at the beginning of life .they are just trying to collect the tools to explore a new , unknown and charming land .so they are focused on constructing their lifes for their futures instead of living in present time and enjoying their experiences .they have to go to a college or a university first of all to guarantee a sustainable living .and preparing for all those exams and trying to cope with all unpleasant side effect such as stress , sleeping problems and depression is not so enjoying .going out with friends sometimes and getting into drinking rituels does not mean that they are pleased with their lives or they are enjoying life .because of the pressure of a comfortable future life , real life is forgotten .to graduate from a college is even a problem because that is the end of your student life and you are now expected to find a good job and try to survive , you can not depend on your parents from now on , nor your friends : you are completely alone in an unknown world .you have to woork a lot , to be considered as a succesfull person for yourself and for the people near you , you should buy a car , and then a house .untill here , these are my experiences .here are my fathers  and my mothers  : my father has just retired , he is an actor and he worked for a state held theater organization more than thirty years .he had to put off all his wishes and desires because his children were in college and they needed money .but he does just what he wants now : he is travelling a lot to see different artistic performances in theater , he is working on his own plays , reading lots of books and he is passing three monts of the year along the sea coast in our summer residence in that unique environment in one side a forest , in another side the bluest sea of the world .my mother also passes most of her time in our summer residence , where i hadnt seen for four years .she goes out whenever she feels bored to the nearest theater to watch the coming films and it was ages ago when i last saw a film .she sometimes visits my brother living in one of the most beautiful winter sports center of my country .so , whenever i look at them , i feel that enjoying you life is a very very long experience , a gift perhaps , attained after so much struggles , or may be a sort of achievement and can not be wholly understood by young people .we are just at the beginning .i hope that someday it will be our turn .
