i claim that most advertisement pushs much higher level than they really are .in these days , you can see ads everywhere around ; on a highway , on a street , in your living room , e.g. tv , radio , computer .we are surronded by so many ads , but how many of them did you really see or read or examine carefully ?now you see many people are working professionally just for ad industry .advertisements usually have much less information than the product really has .it used to be the case where there are tons of text on the poster or newspaper ads .however , some newspaper said out that people usually do nt bother to read much text on ads because we are lazy and busy on everyday s life .nowadays you can find dod .com adress for further ditailed information for those who really interested .unfortunately , that can mean advertisements does nt have to provide enough information on them .they can say only good things about the prodoct .it is obvious that there are many professional firms just for advertisement .they are really professional and they have been in business many years , so they know many techniques like how to attract people , how to entertain people by sound and cool cutting-edge computer graphic hollywood made visuals and so forth .who would like to make the product worse ?it is no doubt that they are working to try to make products look better in order to convince potencial custemer to buy those products .in fact , that may cause some troubles where they could provide untrue information .as i wrote above , most advertisements are made by true professional creaters and looking , sounding , entertaining really good .the thing is people have to be really careful about the information provided about many ads in these days .
