i agree with this opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .i have some reasons for support my idea .nowadays , many environmental problems occur in the world : global warming , air polution , and acid rain .these problems cause the exhaust of cars .so , if twenty years pass , many people become careful about these problems .also , they think the exhaust of cars are serious problems .therefore , i think that the number of people who avoid using car easily comes to increasing because they come to regard the problems caused by the exhaust of cars as serious problems .also , there are possible situation that the tax of cars will be increasing .so , many people come to be worried about and have trouble about the economic problems .however , these days , the government tend to raise the tax in order to make the pention systam batter , in fact .consedering these modern movement about tax , the tax of car is increasing more in twenty years .as a result , people who avoid buying and using cars increasing .at the same time , people come to use the public transportation .so , the nessesity of cars is decreasing .moreover , if twenty years pass , the society become more convenient than today .so , new environmentlly friendly and convenient transportation may be invented .people come not to use the car .also , in the future , people will come to travel farther than today .so , people can not move with using cars .consequently , the necessity of using cars is decreasing .for these reasons , i think in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the reason is that people will come to regard environmental problems as serious ones .also , people will not pay the tax of cars in the future because of higher tax of cars .moreover , in the future , the necessity of using cars is decreasing because of invention of new transportaion .thus , i agree with the statememt that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .
