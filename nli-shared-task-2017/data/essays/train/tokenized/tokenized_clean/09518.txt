some people thinks that courses taught in universities are too theoreticals and should be more based on facts instead of general ideas and concepts .i strongry disagee with this opinion for several reasons .the first reason why i think that ideas and concepts are more important for student than simply learning facts is that you can always learn facts by yourself .actually , you do nt even need to be a student in a classroom to learn them .indeed , most fact are just data that can be memorized with no or little understanding .but what really matters is the the underlying cause of a fact , even if it is very general .for example , a fact in finance is : `` you should diversify your portfolio in order to lower your risk  .but what is really important behind this fact is to understand how the risk can be evaluated , and what are the main factors that make diversification an efficient investment strategy .if you do nt understand the concept , you might still be able to learn the facts , but it always will be a limited basic understanding .secondly , ideas and concepts will eventually help you to understand the facts and therefore are more important .for example , you may be able to memorize the list of all the presidents of the united states , but is nt the idea of creating a democracy in america more important than a list of name ?students do nt have to become factbooks or encyclopedias but should be able to understand the facts based on the concepts and ideas that they have understood in class .it is a deeper knowledge and probably more general but it is also a key to deal with new situations .in conclusion , the role of a university is to make students become responsible persons able to think by themselves and to give them keys to better learn and understand facts : ideas and concepts .
