i belive that all the people want to enjoy their lives .not only old people but also young people , too .i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people are more energetic .young people can make more time than old people to enjoy .young people do nt have to think about the other people in the family like old people .first , young people are more energetic than old people .they work hard and the next day they can enjoy snowboarding whole day .then they have no problem to go to work the next day .the do nt get tired easily , because they put priority to enjoyment of their lives .however , old people do nt want to get too tired since they care about their hearlth more than young people and their bodies do nt follow their mind .second , young people are more flexible at their time .old people have to think about thier jobs and consider the other people s schedules , too .on the other hand , young people can make time whenever they want to .they can come home late to go to the movies and go to the libraries until late at night not considering the time .finally , there are more possiblities that young people are singles .when they are singles or do nt have the babies .they do nt have to think about what other family members  opinion about their enjoyment of their lives .they can go to the night clubs .they can go to trip whenever they want to .but when they are not singles , or have children they should consider many situations , and ca nt be selfish .from above the reasons , i think young people enjoy life more than old people .they do nt have to think about many situations which old people have to do .health , flexible time and what other family members .
