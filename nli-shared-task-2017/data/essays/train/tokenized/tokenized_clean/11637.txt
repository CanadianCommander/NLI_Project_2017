although there are several debates about how people bacome successful , i am really supporting that successful people always prefer trying new ideas to doing what they know exactly .there is nothing to do with someone who insists on being what he or she is and do nt taking risks in order to improve herself or himself .first of all , although people do a job very well , thay can not be successful because of their lack of imagination .they usually make same thing in same way every day .on the other hand , people using their imaginations and inventing different methods for doing a job are usually the best positions in the companies .for example , there are several people working in a company but there is only one major and this major has already make a difference with other employees .in addition , people continued doing something in the same way  they can not recagnise other facilities .for instance , if sakip sabanci who was the most sucessfull businesman in turkey did not realise people need oil rather than socks , he would not be the most successful businesman in turkey .he started to work by selling socks but he did not continue the work because he realised a good work which he could earn more money .this was a risk for him but he did not hesitate about taking risk and he became the most sucessful businesman in turkey .according to the aforementioned , in essance , sucessful people are always makes something in different way because if they insist on going old-fashioned way they can not recognise other facilities .even thougy they realize facilities , if they can not take risks , they can not be sucessful and also it is not possible that they improve themselves .
