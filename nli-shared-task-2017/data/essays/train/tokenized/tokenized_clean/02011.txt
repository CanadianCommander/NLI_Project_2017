in my opinion , the car and other vehicles used for transportation have a central position in our modern society .the use of cars will therefore not decrease but even grow in the future .to ensure that development being sustainable we have to make great efforts in science and technology .first of all , i am convinced that transport in general is the heart of our modern world economy .the globalisation of our world has only been possible because of a broad and intensive use of cars , trucks , ships and other vehicles .within this process the structure of our modern economies got more and more focused on cheap transport and mobility .second , cars a an important part of the people s daily life in every modern society .we use cars to travel , to work , to go shopping and even to compete against each other ( e.g. in motocar races ) .beside that , it is an important status symbol for many upper and middle class people .in my opinion , the importance and therefore the demand for cars will increase substantially on a worldwide scale - especially in developing countries as china or india where the new emerging middle class is heading for private cars .but there are also problems with a possibly growing number of cars around the world : first of all , the exhaust fumes and production process will cause a lot of environmental damage .the second problem that arises is the question how all those cars and vehicles can be fueled .the worldwide quest for petroleum and oil , from which gas for cars is made of , is growing higher and higher .to challenge those two problems , scientists and car producers have to concentrate on doing research to find alternatives to the current car concepts .there are promising ideas and experiments , but still no revolutionary new concept to assure a sustainable use of transportation vehicles in the future .finding those alternatives is absolutely necessary to further enjoy the benefits the car brings to different societies and economies around the world .
