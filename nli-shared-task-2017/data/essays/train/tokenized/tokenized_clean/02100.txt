the statement infers that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are .on the one hand i believe that this suggestion often might be true .on the other hand you have to consider that every enterprise wants to make the best of his product and advertisement is always a good way of addressing customers .the enterprises are doing great research work to produce the best possible advertisement for a product .they pay other enterprises to make studies on what customers are attracted by .of course they have to present their product in an very attractive way .for example the advertisements for body - lotions often include very good-looking women .the customers are firstly attracted by the advertisemnet with the beautiful woman , then they relate the woman to the product , they buy the product and then they might be dissappointed because they do not look as the woman on the picture after having applied the lotion on to the skin .it is understandable that the customer is dissappointed but the enterprise has reached its goal and has sold its product .at this point i will come to the other side .it is not fair that the customer has spent so much money on something he believed in but was dissapointed .of course an advertisement has to be attractive but nobody is allowed to lie .the customers often loose their confidence in the enterprises and will never buy anything of this enterprise again .i believe that it is more effective to stick to the truth .the customers would not be dazzled by promised results and might buy the product again .additionally advertisements are not only been made on tv or on the street but in conversations .people tell each other of somenthing new they have tried and they give good reputitions so other people might try this product , too .sometimes it is in my opinion even more effective to make advertisements in form of promotions in supermarkets where a real person talks to you and lets you try the product .having tried the product and having talked to somebody who knows more about it is in my view better than having unpersonal advertisements on walls in the city .in conclusion i would say that there are much better ways to present a product than to overrate it and lie to the customers .
