we live in a era in wich every product has an advertisement .for example when i watch tv , or i listen to the radio , or i walk on the street i can see , and listen a lot of advertisements .usually the media describe the products like they are the best but , unfortunately , in a lot of cases this is not true .for example i ve just bought a new television .i saw on the tv the advertisement and it described this television like a really beaufiful product with a lot of new technologies details and , for this reason i decided to buy it .when i arrived at home and i decided to use it a realized that all i heard , unfortunalety , is not true .i m very sad for this choise because i spent a lot of money for a bad product and i think that i m really stupid girl .on the other hand , there are also advertisement that explain only true advantages and tell true information , in order to garantee the quality and the good name and reputation of the brand .for example my brother bought a car last year and nowadays he s really happy for this choise .i think he s a really fortunate boy !i think that the advertisement shall say only the true and in this way people can choose the different products whitout the fear to buy a bad items .the rights of the consumers are not respected by the media and i belive that this problem can be risolved soon as possible .people spend a lot of time to study the product , because they do nt want to spend a lot of money for items that are not like they want .at the moment , i think that is really dangerous buy something without a corret information about it .i trust , that in the future , the law can change this situation that not advantage the citizens .
