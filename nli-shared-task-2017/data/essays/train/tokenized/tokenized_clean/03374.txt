everybody will face with choices during life time .some people may just choose the safe things instead of risks .however , i believe if one , no matter whick field he or she is in , has the desire to be successful , taking risks will be a necessary step .there are three reasons as below .first of all , people need to try risks while making dicisions about economic events .money is an important part of everyones s life .in order to manage money well and make more money , people are always surrounded by risks .for example , business managers have to choose which product to sell and which good to buy .in this case , they have to think about the adventure .they may earn profit from their choices ; otherwise , they will loose both profits and basic funds .however , to be successful , they have to take risks .another reason why i agree to take risks is that risks also appears in scientific areas .to illustrate , during the old time , scientists who were doing reseach about chemistry had to test those dagerous chemical elements without effective proof .in addition , edison damaged his ear while examing the light .obviously , in these successful examples , sicients all faced with the risks .instead of retreating , successful scientists bravely took these risks .not only do scientists take risks , but also politicains need them .for instance , when politicians need to clarify their opinions , they have to give speechs and talk with a huge amount of people .in this case , there may be some killers , who hold the opposite idea , waiting on their way .although it is a risk for politicians  life , they have to handle it and face it as long as they want to succeed .after exploring these reasons above , it is not hard to conclude that taking risks is really essencial to be successful .business men , scientists and politicians have shown people this rule .therfore , taking risks should become a crucial step in the process of being successful .
