a community can not stand up alone .the government does its best to improve its community .those in charge do what they can inorder to help their communities .but the question is : can the government or those in charge improve a community by themselves ?in other words , can they improve a community without the help of young people ?some young adults think that they have nothing to do with their community .they think that it is not their responsibilty to help their communities .others believe that they have to help their community , even if they do not have enough time .in my opinion , young people nowadays should devote time to helping their communities .there are several reasons why they should do this .first , those in charge can not perform all their jobs or activities alone .they need support and help from the young people .for example , if the government decides to build a healthy , clean club for the sake of young people , can this happen if a young people enters this club smoking a cigaratte or if h/she throws a waste paper ?moreover , the youth should help keeping the river and streets clean because this would make their community healthy and free of any pollution .second , young people should help their communities by devoting time and money to charity s activities .for example , they would visit an orphanage , play with orphans , buy them new clothes and toys , and so on .this would help in building up a flourishing , kind community .in conclusion , there are many reasons why young adults should devote enough time to help their communities .they have to support the governement in new project by avoiding doing such bad habits as smoking or throwing wates in the streets or rivers .second , they may help the community by performing charities  activities which would help the community in lifting up the spirits of the poor and the orphans .thus , i believe that it d be great if young people devote much of their time in helpinh their communities .
