whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is an interesting staetement and , in my opinion , it is quite extreme , too .i think it mostly depends on the situation you are in : because of this i said that it is an extreme affirmation .it is impossible to generalize such a variable thing .in fact , everyone of us can find himself in so many possible situations , all different one from eachothers , that can suddenly change his behavior : in some situations he can first be a person that tries new things and likes risks , but in other occasions he can be just the opposite of who he was .let s make some useful examples in order to support my position .my father is a very successful man : he is the chief officer of the family enterprise and he usually likes tring new things and taking risks .for example , one of his principal activities is to buy and to sell stocks on the stock exchange market .this is a real dangerous business , because you can loose all you have in just one bad and unlucky `` bet  .in this case , my father usually acts riskly : he always says that if you do not risk you do not make money .but occasionally it happens that my father changes his behaviour : sometimes doing this activity , in other words exchanging stocks , he transform himself in a really aware person .i think this is due to some particular events that occur to the market , and because my father know them and has a lot of experience , he pays attention to them .to sum up , what i really want to say concerning to the topic presented in the title is the following .it is true that in order to become a successful person you have to be innovative and you have to like risks too .but , there are many situations that obbligate you to become aware of what you to and to avoid a risky behavior , unless you want to loose your characteristic of being a successfull person .
