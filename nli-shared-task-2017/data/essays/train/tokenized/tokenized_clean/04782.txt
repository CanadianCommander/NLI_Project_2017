i disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .because the truth of the thing is always right way for everything .the advertisements make producets seem much better that ca nt to stand forever .first reason i think the products did nt need to seem much better thatn they really are that because when i go to the shop center to buy something , i usually need that and we will buy it .if we bring it go home and found it is nt well as we saw at the shop center .i will fell sad .and i will remember its name then i will never to buy the thing of the name again .actually the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are , that means they wants to sale a lot of products .if every customs will never buy it at the second time .i think that is the obside what they want .that may make the children to learned the bad habits .second reason i think we need keep the truth of the products is because we need keep the truth for everything .when a little child came with his mum and saw the process of thing as same as the fovered .he may be learned from it and do something as same as that .he wo nt do the truth of the thing .that the trouble with the future .finally , i think if we can work hard for everything .and try to do the best .then we will not need some advertisements make products seem much better , and the products will be the best .to show the truth of the things may be not well at that time , but it is a good way to change to the best .
