nowadays is a lot of disccusion about what is more important in the process of learning in the students , we have two possible answers : the first one is to understand ideas and concepts , and the second one is to learn facts .i think that the answer for this could be finded in the requeriments that the majoriy of jobs have to day .usually in jobs the people have to take decision all the time , for that you need to understand the advantages an disadvantages of the possible chooses , and have a good idea of the consequences of your decision .i am going to explanin how the two process - understand ideas or learn facts - can help , or not , the people to adquire the capability to take decisions .in one hand we have the idea of just learn facts .how you can learn something you can repeat the concept a lot of times , but you do nt understand wat you are saying .in the other hand , if you understan a idea , you can answer a new question because yuo have in your mind a possible path to obtain the answer .for example when i child learn to multiplicate just repeting the tables of multiplication , he knows this specific operations , but if you ask a new one he can anwer , because he do nt now how to multiplicate two numbers .but if you teach a boy how fuction the multiplication , the child can answers any question becasue he knows how to obtain the answer .another fact , that is important , is that when you just learn the concepts if you forgetted you can do anything .but in you learn how to obtain an answer by a logical way , i am sure that you always can be available to answer .finally i strongly believe that the concepts are not necesary to learn , inasmuch as they are always in the books .in conclusion , i thinks that the best way to learn somethink is to understand the ideas and te concepts .because is preparig you the the laboral life
