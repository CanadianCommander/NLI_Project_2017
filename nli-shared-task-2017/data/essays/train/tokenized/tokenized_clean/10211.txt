i firmly disagree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .i would say at any time that digging in one field of study as far as you can go is much better than poking others wasting time and effort .the reasons for this are lack of in-depth knowledge and difficulty in being successful in career .perhaps , a famous saying in my country , ` when digging a well , dig only one , could give a fundamental idea about my opinion .i will discuss my reasons in detail in the following passages .first of all , having broad knowledge in many academic fields may seem wonderful from time to time but it would only result in lack of in-depth knoweldge in any of those fields .for example , if you study biology for 4 years instead of physics for 2 and biology for 2 , you will get really deep knowledge in biology and even be able to plan your future academic life more easily .also , this might get you acknoledgement from others and raise a possibility that you will be awarded for it someday .secondly , for most people schools are supposed to help them to get advanced in their career .having broad knoweldge in many fields can seriously damage your future career plan .suppose you are being interviewed by excutives for a nice job .they will certainly be looking for a person who would do well on the jobs assigned to them .they will want some who know what they are really doing , not just someone with various , but useless knoweldge on different fields .this also can seriously hamper your promotion in the organization , even if you get hired .a person with speicialized knowledge has more chance to advace in the organization since they can really develop thier niches and know exactly where they stood and are going .in conlcusion , specializing in one specific subject makes a person more realiable as well as knowlegeable .keeping integrity personally and professionally has always been repected by others and accepted to be better than having shallowness in a variety of fields .just looking at today s academic environement , it is easy to know that people are heading more specialized direction than ever .
