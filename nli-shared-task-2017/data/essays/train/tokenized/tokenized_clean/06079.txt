everyone knows that adverts are made on purpose to sell , it means that products shown on televivion or in magazine do always look much better than in reality .sometimes it happens that you watch an advertisement on television , which tells you that a certain product is exactly what you need .basically they show you many evident qualities , like bright colors or enormous sizes , that are supposed to belong to the object , but once you arrive in the shop you get a huge disappointment : the thing you expected to be big and amazing is usually much smaller and does nt really look like the one you have dreamt about .this point can easily be explained mentioning the psychology role in making advertisements .in fact , what products really need for being sold , is expectation .it means that the value of an object is determined by the psycholocical impact this object is able to have on people .provided that behind every advertisement there is the long and hard work of a brilliant psychologists equipe , people should always try to look at icons through an objective point of view .for `` objective prospective  i mean that people should try not to be influenced by external - and sometimes subliminal - messages .messages i am talking about are generally used by brands to drive people s mind in a certain direction .so , according to what i have just analysed , i think that it is very important to be aware of what the bid compasnies are doing through advertisement .in my opinion advert - mechanism is a clear example of brain washing : without even know it , in some ways we are forced to do something they want : buy their products .i reckon that this situation is very dangerous and terrible at the same time : i mean someone is controlling us , isn  it scary ?
