in my opinion it is normal that successful people try new things and take risks because they see the world in a different way that is quite different than a normal worldwide .for examle .rich people do nt care about money and for this reason the will never be warried about a kind of investment , they have enouth money to live however .for poor people ( middle-class people ) doing investments is a very hard problem because they have a little quantity of money avaleable which is the result of years and years of work .for this reason they will think several times befor doing something new taking risks .i have mentioned this example because i m living a self experience about this topic .i m studying in milan ( but i m original of the south of italy ) and for me this is a great opportunity that my parent are giving to me , and i appreciate a lot the efforts they are doing to let me stay here .so befor doing this choise me and my family spend a lot of time to plan togheter ( to convince them to . . )my future .only at the and , after they have benn considered al risks , they agree with me .this is nt the case of a friend of mine , with a very successful family , which had the opportunity to try new studying experiences abroad even if he was nt plenty convict .he tried because the most he could lose was `` an year  spent far away from the family .another radically different type of example could be the following .successful scientists are always pushed to try new theories , to discover new things because it is an innaturally aspect of their personality
