i totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .today , advertisements and marketing play more and more a decisive role in business world .as the competition is considerable , the firms are obliged to sell theirs products .therefore , they have to create a brilliant advertisement convincing the customers and sometimes they invent advantages of theirs products which does nt exist .in order to enhance the market position and to stay competitive , the firms try to present their product as an ideal product .it is obvious that several customers are disappointed after having bought the product due to the fact that the product does nt fit to the features made in the advertisement .the globalisation is certainly one of the reasons why the advertisements become more and more irrealistic .the firms and the products are pressed to compete not only with firms of their own country or their continent but also with firms from all over the world .the advertisements are distributed and shown in several countries so that the pressure increases .the world is become one huge market .thus , one can even understand why the firms change the product features .in this context , it is necessary to mention the role of marketing .the budget of the marketing departments are in general very high .for this reason , the firms are able to create sophisticated advertisements which comprise special effects and sometimes even coincide with films .because of the perfect advertisement , the customer could believe that the product is perfect .nevertheless , i think that the advertisements should reflect the real caracteristics of the products .the firms should be fair and respect theirs customers by not making the products better than they reallz are .
