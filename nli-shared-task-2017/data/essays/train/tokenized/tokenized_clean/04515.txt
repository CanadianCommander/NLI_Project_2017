the older the people , the more enjoyable the lifesome people believe that young people have a lot more to do with life than older people whereas some others think that it is the opposite .i guess as a young person i am in that second group thinking that older people enjoy life better than we young people do for a number of reasons like having more free time , more consciousness about the value of the time concept and having better financial conditions .people are born , grow a little and start school in a usual life cycle .after that beginning , they usually start working immediately after school and can not find the enough time for an enjoyable life .unfortunately , they find this time to live more enjoyably only after years and years , at the time they became old people .old people are usually retired people who have more spare time to live as they want .in addition to that , old people usually are wiser than the young people and as a consequence of their experinces and advanced opinions about the life , they know the importance of time concept and how valuable an effective time usage is .i believe that this would help them in thinking twice and having a more enjoyable life in a better-managed time period than young people can do .finally , since old people are usually retired people and have money from their pension funds or their own savings from their investments done in the previous years they would have a bigger chance the enjoy the life in that old age .at that point , i know that people not necessarily have a lot of money to live more enjoyably but money has a considerable effect on well being and more money means more opportunities to evaluate to have fun or to enjoyment in life .to sum up , all these reasons make me believe that old people have more opportunities to live their lives more enjoyably than younger people can achieve .more free time , more consciousness about time management and an amount of money that can easily spend on better opportunities of an enjoyable life rather than only survival would be good assets for a better taste in life .
