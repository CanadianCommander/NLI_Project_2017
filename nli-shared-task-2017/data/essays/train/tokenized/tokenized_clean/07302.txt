i disagree with the statement .i think it is more important to focus o one specific subject which you are interested in and make it to your major skill .you have to be the best on the subject you chose to gain success .there are some examples to prove that one good specific subject is much helpful than broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .i have two uncles .one was very good at business and another was just normally good at all the subjects .later on , an uncle who was very good at business chose his major skill to business and study deeply in business .finally , he graduated very good business university and got a good position in a company .on the other hand , an uncle who was adequately good at all the subjects could nt make good choice to decide his major skill .he majored english but his english was not as good as those people who focuses on only english .therefore , he is now just a normal teacher in an english acadamy .as a result , the uncle who was good at only one specific subject seemed to have better life in the future .another example is about a famous soccer player called ronaldo who is the best soccer player .ronaldo is only good at soccer .he is nt good at math , business and other things .he only practiced soccer from when he was young .as he tried to do best on his job and focused on only soccer , he finally became best of it .since he became best of well known sport , he got wealth and fame at the same time .if he tried to do other sports also , he surely wo nt be in the position he have in present time .as a result , to be a best on the subject you chose is very important .people will always look for the person who is best at their subject because they are sure the person is good at the subject .when you become the best at a certain subject , you will gain wealth and fame at the same time as ronaldo did .therefore , try to find something that interests you and do your best to make it your major .
