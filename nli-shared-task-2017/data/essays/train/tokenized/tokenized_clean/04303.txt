what successful people has in common ?how do they reach this success ?it is probably a more complex question that it seems .some people are sure to meet their goal and to be successfull by taking risks and attempting new things .yet others are just trying to become the best in one well-known field and do not dare to go through new experiences .at issue is how to meet your assignments and reach success .to the most daring people , every experience is good to try .that is true that an attempt does not do any harm .and even if your experience does not appear as good as you expected , you still learn a lot .most experience does worth a try .for instance , if you want to become a good cooker , you should try new receipes .to learn how to cook , you need to invent new receipes and not only to follow others advices .however , some people prefer to adopt a less risky behaviour .they are going to reach their goal by following , pace by pace , others advice .some artisans seem to match this description .they want a comprehensive view of their own field and they are going to explore what does already exist .it is a different approach but they are likely to reach success .their knowledge need patience and long lasting research .for instance , in order to know how to work wood m , you could explore different civilisations and cultures .you will certainly discover a great amount of interesting details which are going to be a great help in your next work .i found that i ca nt align myself on either behaviour .most of the time , i adopt both attitude to meet my assignments .in order to be successfull , both taking risk and following the well-known path is usefull and effective .
