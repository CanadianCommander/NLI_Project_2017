i agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i will explain the reasons why .first , the purpose of advertisements is to make people buy or consume those products .to accomplish this purpose , the weaknesses of the products should be hided and the strengths of them must be emphasized .for example , in an tv advertisement for a medicine used for impotence , the people makes that advertisement try to persuade people with impotence by using different stimulations such as visual signals and sounds .when i watch it , i think i should try some day even i do nt have that problem .they comment some side effects at the end of the advertisement in very fast speed and use ambiguous words such as `` may  , `` some  , `` rare  or `` most  .second , through advertisements , the qualties of the products will be exaggerated because the producers of the products try to beat their competitors .let s think about the competition between coca cola and pepsi cola .they use different advertisement strategies to beat their competitors .they add nice-smelling cherry flavor to attract the people like sweet taste .they develop a low calorie cola named `` diet coke  or `` diet pepsi  even these products do not contribute reducing weight .in conclusion , i agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
