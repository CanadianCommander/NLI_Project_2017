in this flat world , which has seen some great advancements made in the last decade , things have changed rapidly .the world has gotten competetive and everyone is trying to outdo others and grow at a faster pace .work hours have gotten longer , and people have little or no time even for themselves and their families .if you ca nt stand out , you are left behind , and no one wants to be left behind .things are very different today than they were , say , 50 years ago when people took up one job , and were happy to work for the same company for the rest of their lives .it not like things were very easy back then , but they were nothing like what is going on in the world at the moment .today s youngster knows that in this ever changing world , if he does nt outperform himself everytime , he will be outdated before he even knows about it .this change in lifestyles and work enviroment has added lot of stress and pressure on todays youth .however , i do not believe that this means that the young people today are not giving back enough to their comunity .they may be short of time , but they try to make up for in different way .there are ngos where people like to donate part of their weekends , so that they can work with the poor and the deprived .there are people who make up for this lack of time by donating money to efforts that they believe in .bill gates , world s richest man , is relatively young , and one of the biggest philanthrophists the world has seen .he has pledged his wealth for various causes , and his wife runs a foundation that tries to help out with various problems in third world and developing countries .a lot of indian/chinese expatriates , living in the us , are young and successful .they probably have not been able to spend enough time for their comunities back home .but does that mean , that their contribution to the society is nothing ?besides obvious things like sending money back to india/china ( which can be used for the welfare of the community ) , they have helped develop an image for the country , as that of a nation full of talented and hardworking people , which has played an important part in taking their country to the next level in this competitve world .thus even though they did not spend a lot of visible time helping their community , it was the fruit of their labor that the community and country bore .to summarize , i would say that even if the generation of today does not have enough time on hands , however , they have done a lot for their communities .their contribution goes a long way in changing the shpe of the world we are currently living in .
