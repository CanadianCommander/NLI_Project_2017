i totally agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because the main purpose of advertisements is to sell the products , of course they need to show the advantages of the products to attrack consumers and hide the disadvantages to avoid unnecessary damage to the products  images .advertisement , as we know , is a kind of promotion .companies use advertisements to introduce their products to the public and want the public like their products .however , not all products are perfect ; therefore , they will try to just show the good part of the product in the advertisement .in fact , consumers will have high expectation of the products they saw in the advertisement .sometimes , the higher you expectation is , the bigger disappointment you will get .that s why people often think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .furthermore , advertisements will not show the disadvantages of the products to you .you only can learn how the product actually works or whether you really like the product or not through your own experience .for examle , i saw the advertisement of tacobell s new product on tv last month .it seemed so delicious and had plenty of ingredients in it .i could nt help thinking about the picture of that product all the time .finally , one day , i bought the product .i was so disappointed when i first saw the product in real .it was so tiny and almost had nothing inside .and of course , it was not so delicious as i imagined before .to sum up , advertisements are made to sell their products and they always only show the advantages of products and skip the disadvantages .
