i think it s probable idea that the use of cars will be decreasing from 2 decades now .as we think of the speed of science development , it s true that most people think the use of cars will be decreasing tremendously .not only the reason of the development of technology , but also the larger exploit of natural resources .besides , there are also some facts which makes people to think like that .we ve often seen the news or tv about the possibility of flying cars .truely so , in 10 years , most technicians assumes that it would be possible to ride the flying car .and from this moment , multitude of people will prefer to having flying cars instead of normal cars .however , these are not the only reason .nowadays , technicians from the many kind of field worries of the deploring of natural resources .to prepare the deploring of natural resources they re eagar to make substitute resources .furthermore , a few of them are now being used in our daily life .also , in 20 years , every single city or rural areas will be developed as a convinient transportation places where it is not essential to ride car to move anywhere .naturally the number of in use of car people would choose the use of more convinient transportation than cars .furthermore , it s poplular for all people `` the well being  .many people started to care their health and exercise more harder than ever .if this trends goes on for 20 year , for their health , most people will choose to walk or use the convinient transportation .it is mutual hopes that most people wants to reduce the number of car users or car numbers not only for the air pollutions or traffic problems , but also to elevate the quality of our life .but , there are always exceptions in any cases .it would be plausible for people to use their cat who have their car in an emergency or haphazard .also it s possible people who likes more to use only their car .so after 20 years , it would be possible to reduce thenumber of car users and also cars and peole will use their car efficiently .
