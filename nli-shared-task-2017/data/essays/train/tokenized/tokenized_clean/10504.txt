i agree with this opinion because i believe a lot of knowledge gives people a lot of ideas .it looks completely true that for being specialists of one specific subject , all you have to do is continue to only study the subject for good .of course i think it is important for specialists to do their best for learning their topic .but i believe everything in the world is related complexly with others .for instance , let s think about energy .it looks very simply problem on fossil fuels , however it is not true .nowadays , most of human beings can not live without energy .people must know that more and more use of fossil fuels makes global warming .in addition , they also know fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas are limited .well , now , how many people can stop their convinient life thanks to energy ?i believe almost all people can not dispose their life completely right now .so what we should continue such life ?because of it , these days humans are managing to deal with global warming and searching next new fuel of energy .when someone treat this problem , how can he cope with it , only using one specific subject ?engineering ?or chemistry ?or biology ?i never believe that any people could solve this problem only by one specific subject .therefore , i believe that everything is connected with others in some kind of shapes , so we have to study many academic subject to cope with such difficult problems .
