everyone has different opinion on whether traveling in a group that is led by a tour guide or by ownself .it depends on individual people s various point of view .however in my perspective , traveling in a group give more advantageous to me .because , it is convenient and easy to understand the country .first of all , people can visit all the place with out any difficulties .of course it would be more interesting and advantureous to be travel by ownself , however traveling in a group give more profit to people .in my personal experience , when i tralved alone to australia , i had a trouble with the visiting tourism place , because i lost my self in the middle of the town , so i faced difficulties looking for the place .moreover , i spend about two hours looking for a information center .if i had a tour guide , i would had a wonderful vacation in australia visiting many fun place , instead of wasting time on the road .secondly , people can understand and the country easily .although , peopl traveling without tour guide can also understand the culture and country , however , i believe it is more beneficial to have a tour guide .when my mother and father traveled to the new zealand , they found so many interesting thing from there , because the guide translated all the information that they visited and also , telling story that is relevent to the event or history .therefore my parents could understand the cuture and also some traditional story with out difficulties .thus , people , like my parents who can not speak the language that they are visited , can also learnt about the countrey with out any trouble .in conclusion , for these reasons that i have mentioned above , eventhough , traveling arund the country with tourt guide might be more memorable and more fun , i think however leding guide i more advantagous to me .no on can deny the importance of these assets .
