in modern world , we learned almost every subjects until university .and many students who graduate university are complaining about this education system .because when they get a job , they do nt use many knowledge they learned in school .i can understand their opinion .in some part i agree with that .however , it ca nt be a reason that we just have to learn one specific subject .learning variety of knowledge is very helpful for the people to be a specialist in some area .if someone want to be a biologist , he needs to experience other subjects .mathematics , literature , athletic . .etc . ..after he experience these areas he can be found his special gift in biology .unless he did nt experience these areas he could nt overcome his barrier that will face some day .he can think that he may can do other work even though he is not sure about his gift in that area .especially in law , if you imagine about lack of knowledge about other subject , it can be uneffective .law is the subject to constitute the social system .it is related with all parts of the world .it affects the people s life .judge s narrow mind can be biased in one side .and there will be a lot of chaos in public .i think balance is the most important element for the well-organized society .for the balance only one subject kowledge does nt work well
