`` exploring by yourself or leading by someone ?it is a personal choice depends on a person s character and goals because of this people make different decisions to explore or learn somewhere .despite leading by a tour guide , i prefer to explore places and prepare my own travel guide by myself because it costs less money and i might explore more things .getting a service is always expensive than doing these things by yourselves so making your own travel guide is cheaper .first of all , you can save money if you travel by yourselves because you decide what you are going to do on travel and you do nt have to pay for this decision .tour guides provide information about travel and places where you want to go but you can find those information spending a littile bit time on internet .also , tour guides generally guide you to some places where they can get more money for accomodation or shopping so they might cost more than they really are .finally , tour guides always deceive you to spend more money but if you travel by yourselves you could control yourselves to spend your money .for example , tour guides give some options which are really look like fascinating but not important such as staying at a five star hotel it is really essantial for travel ?tour guides just show places where are on their list and this list generally limited .first of all , they lead tour groups to only basic places so if you are in a tour group you might miss wonderful other places .for example , when i first came to chicago , i have paid money to a tour guide to show me real chicago but i just saw millenium park and sears .after a while i discover other wonderful places in chicago where are rush st. hancock tower .as they said `` everthing is in details  so people could find a lots of detail places if they search for their travels .a lots of people prefer a tour guide to travel in a group , however , i prefer to explore places by myself and be my own tour guide because i can save money and i can see more places .
