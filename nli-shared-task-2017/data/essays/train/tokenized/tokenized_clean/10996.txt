it is highly probable that people who have reached success in life have taken certain risks that others were not inclined to undertake .in my opinion this statement could have a certain credibility , even if a satisfying scientific evidence seems hard to be obtained .on the onset , the issue is to define the term `` success  .there could not be clear agreement on its significance .if for many success means the holding of personal properties or of large quanitity of material goods ( money and the like ) , for others could be exactly the opposite .success for them is simply the reaching of a happy life , being satisfied within the family and the close community .it is true , however , that we could agree in general terms on its perception .a successful person is the one who has reached a certain social prestige , who maybe has a certain public visibility or has influenced in some way the lives of other members of the community or the society .in my opinion , it could be true for certain persons to socially succeed ( attaining a social visibility ) and become known by others .this is so because curiousity as well as capability of taking risks are part of humanity .intellect makes human curious and willing to explore new territories .the natural qualities of humans make them to aspire to reach new goals thorugh specific projects .for sure we have examples of successful people in many fields , like the humanities the finacial and industries and similar .we can think about plato or aristoteles or enstein or great leaders , like julius cesar or poets like dante .they did something that distinguished them from the others .they tried new things .einstein explored what was unthinkable before him .dante left us one of the most complex and inspired poem .for many of them , however , it seems that the driving force is not the search of a personal reward for its sake , but the search of an interst in life coupled by curiosity and service to the society .in breif , if we know today that they gained success , it would be very interesting to explore what were ( and still are in successful people today ) the motivations at the base of their projects and risks .
