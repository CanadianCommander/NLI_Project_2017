i prefore to travel with a tour guide exspecially we go to some country and also that is a first time to go there .when we go to some country , we have to speak their language .if we go by ourselve , we have to make a resavation for hotels , and also it s hard to read and understand the menu in a restaurant .when i went to korea with my friends , we did nt join a tour .we had some guide books that showed famous restaurants and places in korea .when we went to a restaurant , the menu was written in hongle , not even in english .we could nt read them , so we just point out the menu when they took orders .the food was nt that we expected .we can learn more things from a tour guide when you go to some historical places .the tour guides know so many things .there are some guide book to lean those histories but sometimes there are not enough to us , and also the books could nt answer the questions when we have some questions about which we visit .we get more explaination from the guides .sometimes , the guide take us a local restaurant or store where local people usually go .when i went to france with a small group of people with a tour guide , the guide took us the restaurant where he usually goes .the food was cheap and really good .and the other day , he took us to a little town in the countly-side of france .it did nt show in any guide books .there are some winaries and stores .we had a really nice time in france .
