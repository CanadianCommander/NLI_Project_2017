the students must understand the ideas and concepts .students are the future of the world , they are the one who will change the world .they must take things seriously and must intent to do that .understanding the ideas and concepts behind , does matter alot and makes difference too .the concepts and ideas which is understood by any student will make him or her take decision on that topic more efficiently .example , a student understood the concepts and ideas clearly and become a succesful doctor .when he or she operate any human being , the patient , his life at risk the decision and the solution which comes out of the concepts and ideas understood by the doctor during his or her class .any failure would lead the patient their life at risk or may be to death as well .a man put his life in doctors hand with trust and hopes .the student must do justice to it .while the critics says , learning the facts are also important by the students .example , imagine a doctor has learned the facts and does not have the ideas and concepts in his mind .he or she would put some person s life at risk .if the person died he would be responsible for the death .the patient could survive and could recover but due to lack of knowledge the patient has to suffer .which i would say is not fair at all .furthermore , the student with the good concept and knowledge about the idea would be more effective and appropriate than compare to the student with learning facts .sometimes learning fact are necessary but mostly the concept and the proper knowledge is taken into account .in the end , the knowledge of the subject should be by understanding the concept and ideas .the better knowledge the better effect could be seen .the understanding of the concept and ideas are always works and gives good output .
