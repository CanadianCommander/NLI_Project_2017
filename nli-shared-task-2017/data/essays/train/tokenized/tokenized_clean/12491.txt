i think that fooling the consumer , who is the one that buys your products , is like auto hurting yourself as by doing this you only lose more customers every day .if we look at modern day society we can notice how we usually get bored of something or someone very easily .from weddings that last one day , to events that the day before are hyped and the day after they take place they are forgotten , we usually change our mind more then one time a day .and this caused the increasing amount of mis-leading ads as the modern day society demands for high quality products at a low price .this is why i think a product that has been launched onto the market must yes be advertised , but with a moderate dose and in a truthful and candid way .it is in human nature in fact to want something badly but once you have it to throw it away as after one day we are bored of it and disappointed by it .in other words : `` the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence  .also its very hard to regain the confidence and trust of a person after losing it the first time .if a product is too hyped , too publicized and too much talked about , yes it will sell good on the first day , but soon after the consumers will realize that after all what they have been waiting for a long time and thought it was perfect turns out a bad product full of flaws .in fact we tend to be more critical and analyze a product more accuratly the more we anticipated for it to arrive .this disappointment , that trust me , will be shared by many others will cause a series of complains on the internet or between friends , that will warn you that that certain hyped product is not as good as it is and will cause in other people a sense of afraidness of spending a fair amount of money on a product that will surely disappoint them .this is why i think a product should be mderatly pubblicized and when it is , describe what the product can actually do instead of filling a commercial or an ad full of asterisks listing the exception or the particular needs that the product must match in order to operate as the ad says so .again by representing the average customer , in my humble opinion , i think companies should start commercializing their ads in a realistic ways and stop promising things that do not even come close to the product s capabilities .thus if companies actually advertise a product correctly then they would have a bigger success than advertising it in a mis-leading way , making a fool of the customer , who at the end , is the one that buys the product .
