i disagree with the following statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as following reasons .first , instead of cars , nothing will be improved and developed in twenty years .i can not find any special reason which there will be fewer car in use than there are today .in addition to cars , we use trains , planes and ship everywhere , however , cars are the most useful and convenient for people .for example , it is very easy to go from the house to the destinaion for children and disabled people especially .they do not need to walk to the station and airports .second , there will be fewer population in twenty years .people have their own cars .if the population decrease drastically , the amount of the cars will decrease .however , it is said that chinese and indian population will increase drastically .it means they will have the chance to get their own cars in twenty years .for example , in japan it will have the chance to increase many cars due to traffic circumstances .it is said that there will be 25 % of old people living .i think they can not continue to use japanese railway and subway .there are a lot of problems for them .first , there are not eleveters at the stations .it is impossilbe to use the station forever even if they are healthy .second , there is a ruch hour , commuting time every day .it start at 9 oclock and finish at 5 oclock at japanese companies .even if you are young student and office workers , it is difficult to adjust to the curcumstances .in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
