i agree that the young people nowadays are not giving time to help their communities .the young people as soon as they finish their schooling they awaiting for the college to be opened .though they do not have so much interest they feel that helping their communities degrade their presitge and it matters alot .in my point of view not only the young people but also their parents are responsible for that .if they have interest and when they go to help , their parents will restrict them .this does not happens in all cases but some of the parents might be doing .for those parents first they must realize the need of help for their community and encourage their young ones .if we take the young people into consideration their parents must be encouraged and the students who are interested in helping the community must form a group and must also encourage the other young people .the problems of the community must be discussed among the group and certain measures must be taken .not only taking the certain measures but also they must be kept into action and the parents must guide their children .this helps the young people not only to help their community but also the nation can changed .taking inspiration of small group of young people each and every young person will come forward to help their own community .by helping these communities the problems that are suffered by the country can prevented as well as removed .finally young people are the main citizens of the country they should have the responsibility over their family , their community and their country .this helps each and every young one to think about themselves as well as about their surroundings .this also helps them in building their carreer in the right path .
