from my personal point of view this matter is a very hard issue to agree or disagree with .because we can not predict the future .i think that cars are something that cause a lot of problems nowadays .for example , in big cities such as : madrid .paris , london or new york the traffic is horrible and this causes a lot of problems .people are late most of the times because of traffic , have a lot of problems , such as , accidents because of traffic , some people even have bad temper because of the traffic jams .and all of this is caused because we have too many cars on the streets .i know that having your own car has a lot of advantages .because if you have your own car you can go wherever you want and whenever you feel like it .but in my opinion people should not be so selfish and think in all the disadvantages .for example i think that cars cause a lot of pollution that damage our enviorment and damage our health too !i can not agree with this statement , at least at this point .because i think that people is very lazy and preffer spending their money in a car than spendig it on public transportation .people preffer doing this for many different reasons not only because they are lazy , i think that public transportation is not good enough to trust in it one-hundred per cent .becuase public transportation sometimes has a lot of problems : ( it breaks down , or it delays . ..etc )i think if public transportation improves within twenty years we might have less cars on the streets than now .but is that posible ?i do not think so .in conclusion i do not agree with this statement for all this reasons .
