i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .for me , enjoying life is not a question of age , it can depend on society , freedom and possible activities .in a hedonistic society , an elderly could enjoy as much life as a middle aged man or even a child , for they would all live for fun and for the moment .indeed , carpe diem is a motto who could make an old person enjoy even more life than a younger one would .freedom is also a factor for slaves , prisonners or a paralised man can not enjoy life as much as a free man would .to be albe to move and do what you want to do when you whant to do is esential for a full enjoyment of life .adopting this point of view , it is also possible to add money as a criteria to enjoyememt of live .possible activities is also a major factor .by saying activities , i refer to cultural activities , in direct opposition with survival activities such as eating or sleeping .to have nothing to do will not allow you to enjoy life .this is where the conflict between young and older people reveals itself , for some say that older people have less numerous and interesting activities than the young .i would argue that it is untrue .i must first claim that the number of activities itself is not essential , as long as monotony and boredom are not reached .the interset of the activities is a different matter .young people , and i must admitt that i include myself , commonly find that activities destined to older peolpe are less interesting .added with the fact that older people usualy addmitt to miss their activities they dissmissed a long time ago we can think that the statement is true .on the other hand , if we ask to older people if they would start their old activities again , most would refuse .we must see that activities for the younger are not banned from the elderly , it is them who no longer want them .activities are more or less interesting depending on the point of view .hence we may say that enjoying life is not a matter of age and that older people may enjoy life even more that young people if they encounter the right conditions .
