i agree with that successful people always try new things to do and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well .as we can see them , most of the them are very advantureous people this fact makes they are very special , and successful people .successful people likes adventure .one of the famous inventor eddison likes advernture .he always tried to get new things that other people do nt know yet .before he invented the light ( electricity ) , he has thousand times of lab for invent the light , evne his lab room was burned down , he never forgive up and enjoy the adventthey has a unique think that is we ca nt even imagine that .eddison was kind of unique child when he was young .he thought the eggs are hetching if he makes them warm so he hugged the eggs for a while .this story is very famous story about his childhood .as we can see , he was not a normal child and does nt have a normal thinking likes other children .that kind of unique thinking makes a person going to be different than others .
