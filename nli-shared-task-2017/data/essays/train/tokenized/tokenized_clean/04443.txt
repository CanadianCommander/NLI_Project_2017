when i was younger , i was not good at mathmatics .then my parents recommended me to go to a place where i can study for math more .according to the experience in my past , i strong ly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .the reasons why i think so are understanding ideas and concepts helps to memorize easily and it makes me be ready to solve more complicatied problems .first of all , i can memorize the elements easier when i can understand ideas and concepts .understanding ideas and concepts means what i learn becomes my knowledge .for example , i went to a place to learn math when i was a child .then my instructor taught me how a formula was made .every formula has an original partern .so i just remember several basic formulas and then i can get different formulas by myself with the basic formulas .usually teachers recommend students to memorize every single formula as if they are all facts we have to learn .however , my instructor showed a process how formulas are made .the behavior lead me to understand ideas and concepts of formula .therefore , understanding makes the amount of momerizing .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts gives me more flexible comprehension when i have a more complecated problem .for example , as math problems , there are different levels of problems .and for tough questions , sometimes i ca nt solve tough question with basic ideas .in that situation , it does nt work to learn facts because i need more creative and flexible solutions for the tough questions .at the time , as my instructor did for me , if i understand ideas and concepts of math , it will be much easier to creat new ways as solving the problems .as my conclusion , it is more importand and acutually more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts because stuents are required more creative thoughts .facts can not change anything because facts are already complete .that s why it is a fact .however , understanding is
