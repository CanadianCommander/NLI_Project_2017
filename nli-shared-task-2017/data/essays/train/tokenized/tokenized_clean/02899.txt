i can not deny the fact that some advertisements make products seems much better that they really are .for example , since online shopping is getting more and more common , sometimes i have to buy things only judging from the information provided by the advertisement , and i received a completely different thing from what i expected from the advertisement .however , consumers are getting smarter , too .there are many advertisements that shows the real information by various methods .there are various types of methods used for advertisement that provide real information .for example , the company provide samples of the products to allow consumers to experience them .with this method of advertisement , the consumers acutually use the products by themselves , and they can make a decision to buy it or not .it is a good example to allow the consumers to get the real impression of the products .another example is that some advertisements provide statistical information .the advertiser conducts a marketing research of their own products to show the users  impressions or customer satisfaction .in this way , the consumers can get the reliable information of what the users actually thought of the products .finally , there are many advertisements that a sales representative actually demonstrate how to use the product .the consumers can ask questions about the product at the site , and the sales person answers information of what the customers really need with showing the products .since the customers are actually looking at the product , it is possible for the consumers to get real information .as a result , customers know that advertisements have a tendency to promote only their good sides , and companies know that it is not enough only to provide good images .there are many methods of advertisement that allows consumers to obtain useful information that represents the actual products .
