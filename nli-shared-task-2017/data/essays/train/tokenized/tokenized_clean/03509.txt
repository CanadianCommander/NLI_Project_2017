one of the most important technological discovery in our days is car .when it was developed and produced by henry ford in the early of twenteeth century , nobody considered this means of transport essentially for his life like it is considered today and i think that it will be the same for a long time .cars are at the basis of modern human life and i think that nothing can substitute it because it is the best way of transport .each family has got about two cars and they are much used than the others way of transport because it is not only useful , but it also allow to go everywhere you like , nearer or faster .thus , each adult use his car to go to work or to go to a trip or someting similar .unfortunately , one of the worst consequenses of a massive car use is the great amount of pollution that each car gives in environment .i ll hope that , in twenty years , it will be possible to project cars that permit to save the beauty of our planet .maybe , the autovehicles fumes will be natural because of their natural source of power instead of oil .furthermore , cars will have a lot of optionals that will make easier to drive for example computer car navigators or a lot of characteristics that will make cars not only a simple means of transport but also a thechnology that improve human lives .in concluson , i think that it is impossible nowadays live without cars and it will be the same in the future .
