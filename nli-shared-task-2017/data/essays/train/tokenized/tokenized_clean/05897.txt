i agree with it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because , when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself .when a student had understand certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself .by understanding it the student will able to answer any type of the question on that topic .for example let us consider that a student is studying on motor .the student need to understand the main idea and what are the concepts that are related to that topic .and how the motor works and many more things about the motor .but , less importance should be given to learn facts .let us consider another example , let us consider one of the topic from the student subjects .the student must know the what is the main idea and the concepts of that particular topic rather than learn facts on that particular topic .when the student is focused to understand the ideas and concepts on a particular topic .when we arise any doubets on that topics they will be able to answer that doubt .now a days the generation is developing day by day .to sustain in this compition world we must have to be more familer about the topics which are very much important .to know such things we have to understand the main ideas of the subject or topic so , that we can face the present world .so i prefer it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than facts .
