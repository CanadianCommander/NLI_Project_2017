in my opinion in th coming years there will fewr cars left in th country side as it is today .there are many reasons , it is realy unsafe to walk on the road .the polution level is increasing , it diffcult to live in metropoliton cities .firstly , as the popullation of the countris is increasing so ther is much less space is required to built up the roads , which cause the people to send lot of time on the stops for green signal .as the time important key for each and every one people use to travel shortest distance on bicycle .secondly , the fossil feuls are depleating , which is only the fuel for the cars .in the coming years when it will be finished that bring hault of the cars .as the cars are generating to much noise and air pollution , the will harder there rule in the future which will decrease the number of vehicles in the future .in my opinion awareness must be brought in the people mind to make less use of cars as tey are threat to the society .thirdly , the public transport is much convinent and cheap for the people to travel .the metros are the best example to trvel within the city .in the coming years , the government will prefer to spend on researches which give benifit to the whole society not to the specific class of people .in conclusion , i want to say that it might be possible that the public tranport take the place of cars .it may be possible that in the coming future be may trvel the longr distancs through the aeroplane .as the chance of accidents are increacing the people may prefer public transport than the private cars .or scienties found air as the safer way to travel people may have another means of transportation .
