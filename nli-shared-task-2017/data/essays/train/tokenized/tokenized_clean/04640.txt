the topic that young people enjoy life more that older people is very practical .while some people believe that youger people can enjoy life more because they posses more energy others are of the opinion that older people with more experience and maturity are able to gain more enjoyment out of life .i am of the first opinion that younger people are able to enjoy life more .this is so because of a variety of reasons that i would like to expand here on .the first reason because of which young people are able to enjoy life more is that they have a strong urge to explore new things and unknown areas of their lives .this urge always pushes them to plan stuff , go to different and unexpolored places and meet new people .and this urge , i beleive , slowly fades with age .this i have observed in many of my own older friends who after attaining a certain age have started to believe that they have seen it all .another reason for my belief is that young people have a never ending expanse of energy to get more out of life and enjoy it to the fullest .this as we are all aware of is because with age our stamina and energy withers a little .moreover , another very important reason bacause of which young people are able to enjoy life more is because they have comparitively lesser tensions in their minds and lesser responsibilities on their shoulders as compared to older people .this is the reason for it is widely known that childhood is the best time in one s lifetime .the reason behind this belief is that as a children we are free of all the anxieties and complexities that surround the adult world today ,in conclusiion i would like to restate my opinion that
