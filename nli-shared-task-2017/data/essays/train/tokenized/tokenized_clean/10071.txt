in japan , where i live , more and more people tend to think it better to specialize in one specific subject .however , i personally agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for the following reasons .first , to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects is helpful to make it possible to do whatever we are required to do after we graduate from universtity .for example , i got broad knowlege of many academic subjects such as literature , law and economic while i was in keio university from 1997 to 2000 .although i majored in german literature in the university , i need to have a knowlege of law shortly after the graduation in order to work for the company i am working for , because there was a big transactions with german company .of course , my knowlege of german was helpful , but what helped me most was a basic knowledge of law , because i have to review the contracts in german .to learn many areas of study is help us more than we expect .this is why i believe that having broad knowlege of many subjcts works well .in addition , to have broad knowledge may help us when certain areas becomes oldfashined .for example , when i was in keio university , german literature was popular .i actually considered to study more in graduate school to study more or to become a translator of germany , because the need for the translator was quite large .however , the trend changed .the translator of germany is not so popular now than it was when i went to keio university .in this respect , we can not imagine which area of study might be helpful as the time goes .i really believe having broad knowlege of academic subjects works .finally , to specialize in one specific subject may make us lose our job .for example , one of my friend who studied only political science lose his job , because the area he studied became oldfashioned .after that had a hard time to find another job , because he does not know well about other subjects than he sutudied in the university .he had to study another subject , such as law and book keeping outside his job .in conclusion , i agree with the statement that to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
