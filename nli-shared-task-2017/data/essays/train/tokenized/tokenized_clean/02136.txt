in my opinion in twenty years we will see more and more cars than we can see today .today we have big pollution and enviromental problems and we experience every years dramatical disasters but actually i think that this would nt stop the trend to have even more cars circulating around the world .i am not happy about this , i am only realistic .emerging countrys like china and india , that were really poor any years ago , are now growhing incredibly fast and they needs a lot of resourses and transports .they do nt care ( for the moment ) about pollution problems , they wants cars .for the moment i do nt see a valid alternative to cars .it could be that in future we will assist at a change in the material that give the power to our cars .the oil resources is another important problem thesedays but the technology progress is running fast and maybe in twenty years we will put water in the fuel tank .someone could think that with the spread use of computer an the presence everywhere of the internet we dontneed anymore to go away
