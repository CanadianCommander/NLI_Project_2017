with the advancement of the technology in the communication sector , the companies are now able to market their products to an anormous number of people in a really beautiful way .for example , the advirtesements on tv are so attractive that people watch them as if they were watching movies .unfortunately , they are misleading most of the time , as they make the products seem much better than they really are .i think , an example from real life would make it clearer what i mean . ..a few years ago , we were considering to change our family car .therefore , we were researching different models of cars , what their properties are , how much they cost , and so on .first , we tried to follow the tv advertisements to get an idea .according to these advertisements , these cars were so good that it was hard to believe that they were actually not from future .nevertheless , they did not give us much information about the futures of the cars .so , we decided to go to the agencies , where cars would be sold , to talk to the salespeople there and to get catalogs with detailed information on every single aspect .of course , the salesmen were really sure in their statements that the cars they sell were the best and capable of doing everything .therefore , they were not very informative .and neither were the catologs . ..the problem with the catalogs was that they were written in such a way that an average person would not understand what they mean and how their cars were different from other models .after all these attempts , we were even more confused than we had been at the beginning .so our choice was nothing but a random one .at the end , we had a car that would break quite often and create problems all the time , although it seemed to be the best car ever produced .now we know that , the advertisements are not the most reliable tools to refer when deciding on what to buy .i guess , it is much better and informative to talk to people who have already bought these products to figure out if they are good or not .
