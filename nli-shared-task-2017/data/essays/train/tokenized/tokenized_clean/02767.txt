acutally , the people getting much older than at older times .that is a result of the development of better drugs .but in additon to getting more older the old people have a better life than the younger generation .in my opinion they can enjoy life more than young people can do , because of some basically reasons .first older people do not have to go to work .they had worked for an average of 35 years and so they are getting pension .they have more free time that mean all the time they have in leisure .they can sleep 10 hours a day .i think that can not do the younger generation .for example my grandmother sleep 11 hours a day .so she is fit and do not feel tired .younger people are often feel tired because they can not sleep so much time because they have to go to where they work .another reason is that older people have more money than the younger have .the older generation had saved money in the time they had worked .the young people had not saved so much money .the older generation can buy a lots of things .all time of the day they can do a shopping - tour because they have enough money .in addition to this the older people can fly everywhere they want for holiday .they are very flexible .in contrast to this i do not think that the younger generation is so flexibil in time .another example is that older people have more social contact .they can meet each other for breakfast , for a cup of coffee or something else .younger people have the problem of the flexibility because if they have free time their friends might not have free-time .as a result of some basically reasons , more free-time , more flexibility and more money i think that older people have more fun their life than the younger people .
