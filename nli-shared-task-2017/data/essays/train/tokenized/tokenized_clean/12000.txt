enjoyment means entertainment , satisfaction of one s soul and containment with the happenings in life .i would like to disagree with this statement .this is because entertainment would mean differently to different people .entertainment depends on various factors like the person s attitude and his notion or perspective on entertainment .the younger generation tends to enjoy themselves by going to parties , meeting new people , making new friends and going for long drives .the way a youngster enjoys himself or herself depends on the attitude and nature of the individual .some people might like to go to parties for entertainment while others might like to watch a movie .on the other hand the older people might also do the same things that youngsters do or they may engage in activities considered as dull and boring by the youngsters .i would like to take examples of two famous personalities here who despite their age never complained of boredom .firstly , i would like to take the example of mother teresa who despite her old age found enjoyment in playing with children and serving the needy .secondly , i would like to take the example of the famous painter , m.f. hussain .m.f. hussain is more than eighty years old but finds enjoyment in his paintings .he likes to draw and finds his entertainment in his drawings .we can find people both among younsters and aged who remain depressed and do not tend to enjoy themselves .they lead the life of a loner and stay in recluse .the youngsters have a pressure to make their life which may in turn have an effect on the way they tend to enjoy themselves .but this might not be the case with the older people .they have a life , they have attained their goals and can live a peaceful life which in itself is an enjoyment .the old people also tend to enjoy themselves by talking to others of their age and about their life s experiences .thus we see that the entire concept of enjoyment differs from one person to other .we can never say with surity that youngsters tend to enjoy more than the old people .everything depends on the nature and the attitude of people .if somebody wants to enjoy age is never a deciding factor .it s the perspective and the likes and dislikes of a person which tends to decide how well the person is enjoying his life .
