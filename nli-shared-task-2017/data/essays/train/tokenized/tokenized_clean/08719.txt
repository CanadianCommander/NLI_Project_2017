nowadays they are a lot more cars than they were before .althought i really think than in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use as today .since the invention of the oil motor , cars appeared .it uses only grew day after day .today it is rare to meet somebody wihtout a car of his own or a driving licence .but it is normal .yes it is .having a car of my own avoids taking a bus or subway , which is less comfortable and of course not that fast .further morre having my own car increases my self-confidence because it is me , and no one else , who drives , who has got the power .contrairly to this we all can see a recess on car-using , and i sincerelly think that this is due to cities  massive growth and to the environmental care .first of all is to be seriously considered the enormous growth of the important cities in the world for industrial , commercial , cultural , administrative or turistic reasons .the result of this growht is the congestion of the cities , which makes appear those big traffic jams that take place the long journey throught .this last consequence pushes the inhabitants to use the subway or other public transport systems .the congestions and traffic jams will get higher as the cities grow and we will never ever want to take the car again .another big reason for believing that cars  use will decrease in the next twenty years is the pollution problems .since the early 1970 a environmental concern has been highly spread ( amog young people at is best ) , and not only because it designs a way of life , but also because our world is seriously injured .this make us think about all the pollution that the human being creates , and among all of this is air pollution , caused in some way by the car .therefore our worries will make us use the same transport so that the consume ceases , and not so many cars , for only one s use .to conclude i like to point out that in twenty years the car use will decrease because this both reasons .we will think it twice when we want to take the car because of patcience and environmental concern .maybe that a restriction is endured by the government which prhibites the car s use in cities .
