in this essay , i will explain why i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .for this , i will say that younger people benefit from a better physical and mental health in general , then i ll talk about the issue of the money and finally i ll talk about the free time for those two category of people .first , it is well known that young people have a better health than older people .a good health allow someone to run , jump , make several sports and also to have a better resistence to alcool , illness or the need to sleep .this is why young people do much more sport and parties than when they become old .after that , i d say that when we are young , we want to move , to travel or to try new experiences .as you re old , you ve already tried lots of things , you may be less kind to try new challenges because you feel that you may not be able to do it .i sobserve it when i see my grandparents .they do nt move from their apartment because they do nt have the courage to do so .some people can say that older persons have more money , that s why they can do more things .i totally disagree whith that because some of them do nt use their money at all and stay at home all the day .others may travel , for exemple i have a grand mother who travelled in india a few years ago .but it was a well organized trip , the kind of trip where you always stay with the same people since the departure at your airport .i do nt think that this is the best way to discover and enjoy a new country .generally , if they have money , they use it the wrong way .finally , it is true that when you stop working , you have all the time you want to enjoy life but as i said before , it is not what happens in most cases , particulary after seventy years old .on the other hand , when you re young , you study or you start working .i think that this is not why you have less free time that you do nt use it well .and sometimes i feel better being with my friends in a classroom than alone watching a movie for exemple .these are the reasons why i think that younger people enjoy life more than older peole do .
