new advertisment is focused on appearance and not on qualityi believe that most advertisement is focused on create a cool image about a certain products .therefore , all these products are useless and will not satisfy consumers preferences .first , companies are more interested to waste money on advertisement rather than on research and development ( r & d ) .consumers will prefer to have a more functional item rather than an item that is useless and expensive .for example , few weeks ago i bought an ipod and i was not sure to buy it because mac has invested a huge amount of money and i heard some complaint about ipod s functionality .anyway , i bought an ipod on friday and just after two days from this day i accidentally drop it and my ipod became useless .second , advertisement is always deep empty and it is aimed to show off a certain product .most of the people get surprised by a nice looking item and its advertisement , but i do not .i take into account as a consumer the focus group that a certain item is aimed to .and if i do not feel close to the idea of the advertisement , i will not consider to buy it .third , advertisement is aimed to hide qualities characteristics in order to cheat consumers .i believe that a good quality product does not need any advertisement .as an example , my oldest brother has bought a bang & olufsen stereo and i have not heard of that brand of stereos before .i did some research by internet about this brand and i got surprised because it is known that bang & olufsen is the best world wide brand for stereos .once again , advertisement always told me that sony was the best brand world wide , but it is not if a consumer is looking for quality .in conclusion , advertisement maybe guarantees a cooler product by its general consent , but not an effective one .advertisement is for not intelligent people and it always try to hide deficiencies on products .
