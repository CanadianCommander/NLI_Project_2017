in my opinion older people enjoy life more than younger people do .i can count two reasons for this .firstly , a younger person does not care about time .he thinks that everything in his life will continue as before .but when he starts to get older , especially after thirty ; he understands that the things are gradually changing .for instance a young man spends most of his time playing sports , going to clubs , watching films etc .after ten years the habits start to change .you start to make a program in which you can use your time efficiently .instead of playing sports most of the time you just play 1 hour a day .or instead of watching tv all night ; you seperate this time into more parts and do many things in order to make it more enjoyable .moreover , perceiving enjoyment of life differs from person to person .from my point of view adding some value to humanity is the prominent aim of my life .for instance when i used to be a freshman student , i always cared about passing the exams .i rarely to think about finding new things and contribute to science world .i thought that after graduating i would have much time to do research .but now i see that if i used my time efficiently and prepare myself to my goals it would have been better .so as time passes people realize that enjoying life is connected strictly to what you want to do in your life and whether you achived your goal or not .when you get older you will be targeted to your dreams closely .in conclusion ; when people get older ; they understand the meaning of life and try to enjoy it more .it comes with maturity .
