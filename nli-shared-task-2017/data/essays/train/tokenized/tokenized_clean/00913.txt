i disaggree with this staement .in my opinion both , understanding ideas and concepts and studying facts , are important .understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students because if they just learn facts they would nt understand them when it comes to more detailed topics .for example studying foreign languages at school .students can practise their vocabulary and the grammar just by learning them in their mind ( the facts and rules ) but it does nt help them when they need to read or actually speak in that language .there you need ideas or concepts which the teacher can give you to learn that language more easily .moreover students need to study praxis .with facts they can not learn them .at this points you need concepts and ideas .for example in a math class .the teacher can teach you some facts and rules about a specific topic but without his or her ideas students are not able to understand that topic .they need to practice the topic by themselves to make sure that they actually understood the sheme of the topic .on the other hand it is also important to study some facts .the subject history could nt be taught without facts .students need to study special dates , for example about the world wars , to understand the timeframe and to get a feeling of the past .furthermore i think that you usually need to get some facts first before you can start to get some ideas or concepts .the best example at this point is again the mathslesson .you need to read some facts or proofs first before you can get into the topic .in my mathlessons we usually had to read first a page with facts and examples before our teacher explained everything a little bit more detailed .all in all i am of the opinion that students need to understand ideas and concepts on the one hand and on the other hand i believe that it is important as well that they study some facts .
