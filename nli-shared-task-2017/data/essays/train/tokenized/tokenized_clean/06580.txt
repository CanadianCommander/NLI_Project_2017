the population of the world are growth day by day .according to this , the needs of the people change .i think , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today if people make the good decision in twenty years .in nowadays , the count of the cars are increase and most of the people use their own cars to go somewhere .by using their own cars , they lose lots of time .except using their own cars , i think they will try to find new ways to reach somewhere quickly .for example , in a long vacations , people will start to use planes instead of cars .because travelling by plane causes them to gain time .nowadays , in our country we can see the examples of that .most of the people preferred to go vacation with their personal cars .but when the plane companies make the tickets cheaper and give the people opportunity to use plane , people begin to use plane instead of car .other reason why the car numbers will be fewer is the traffic .the traffic problem gets bigger and bigger each day .this problem makes people nervous and it takes much more time to reach a place than it can take .they should try to find alternative ways to go somewhere to reduce the traffic jam .the other important reason is reduction in amount of petrolium .we know that petrolium is very valuable and the amount of that decreases day by day .after a some time , petrolium will be find difficultly .in this time , people will use cars which work with different product or they will try to use their cars less .for people , using their own car much more comfortable .but conditions make the cars unneccessary .to gain time , to reduce traffic jam and to protect the recources people should find a new ways to travel .
