young people are the future .they do nt realize this anymore .they are becoming not effective in there communities .young people spend time on usless stuff , they are relayable , and have studying as an excuses everytime they are asked to do something .young people tend to spend so much time on fun stuff rather than helping their community .most young people surf the net for approximately four hours a day .this makes them forget about what sorrounds them .they also spend their time chatting on mobiles .they hang out with each other and talk about what happend in their day .they do nt spend time thinking about their future in this communty and how they must be an effective part in it .young people relay on adults in doing many things .relaying on adults would close their eyes from what sorrounds them .for example , if a young son relays on his father in paying all his fees , he would not have the chance to try having a job .having a job would show him what his community needs .most young people have studying as an excuse for not helping in the community .this is not a proper excuse for not helping their community because each one of us can manage time if they want to do so .for example , students can help their communities by doing community work in their schools .such as selling crafts for charity work .they may toture other students to help them with what is hard on them .all of these characteristics would help their community improve .young people must change .their community needs them .they the leaders of the future .they must care about their community .this community was improved by people that were young one day .what do those old young people have that nowadays young people do nt ?
