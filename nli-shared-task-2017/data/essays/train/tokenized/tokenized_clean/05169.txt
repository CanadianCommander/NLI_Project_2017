this statement is in my opinion a bit to wideranged .so i think that the people in our society are split in two groups : the ones who never help somebody and the ones who care about the well beeing of others .i will elaborate this in this essay in two paragraphs .on the one hand , i think that todays society of young people becomes worse in helping each other because they tend to be more and more sellfish .the kids prefer to stay at home alone to play computer instead of going out in parcs and play football with others in the same age .meeting others is the beginning of creating a community : share free time with others .then , in school , many of the pupils do nt want to help their classmates because of the fear to loose something .after that , when the young people begin to work , they want to earn always more money .at the same time , they do nt want to spend a bit of their spare-time to those who could need it .on the other hand , there have been done many things to get people more involved in helping their communities .often they are in form of voluntary work and many people do nt hear about it even if they would like to help .in germany , they have introduced a `` civil service  .it was made up for those who do nt want to make the military service , so it is obligatory .since it was created , they are many young people who work in hospitals , houses for older people , for handicaps or drug and alcohol ill people .today , the government thinks about putting the military service away and instead of that make the civil service obligatory for all , boys and girls .this would be great , because so everyone gets an experience in helping others so that these people would give help next time easier .i think most of the people do nt go and help people by their own , but with a little experience in social work , they will change their minds on that point .
