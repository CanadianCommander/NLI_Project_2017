people always need to learn something to reach good life standarts therefore learning is the most important aspect of humanlife .everyone has a different point of view , about the idea of learning .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .these are my following theses .firtly , students go to school to learn something .teachers are teaching them to us but we do not awere what they are .for example , when i was a student in a high school .my teacher learned me but he did not want me to understand them .because of this reason , sometimes i do not understand clearly my lessons at my university .in addition to this , to understand concepts can help us in future .if we understand a subject , we never forget it , because we cover it all .we know every thing about it .for instance , we are in a math class and a teacher learns us a formula and he provides it for us .if we understand it how we can obtain it , we always remember the formula .on the other hand , to learn facts is neccesary fo people .something can not be undertand .they have to be learned facts for students .despite the tis idea i prefer to understand ideas and conceptsto sum up , as i said before it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is fo them to learn facts .
