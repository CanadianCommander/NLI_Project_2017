yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do welli agree with this because my friend is very successful person .he is from electonics backround but takes the risk of experimenting the new things , for example one day he had a problem with his bike .it was unable to start .so i told him to take the bike to the mechanic but he didnt do so , instead he says its good chance for me to experiment some thing which is new to me .and he started repairing his bike , it took more then 5 hours and was unable to start , so i said him again to take it to mechanic .but he went on like that with his work .and i was very much surprised to see that the bike started , and even his patience and the motivation towards his work .and he was delighted with joy as his risk was fruitful .so because of this reason i supported the statement .there are some people who actually wants to experiment or take risk but some dont want to do so they will be worried and they will not take the risks .just they do the things which ever they know better .and more over it depends upon the understanding of the people .therefore from the above mentioned example i support the statement that successful people try new things and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
