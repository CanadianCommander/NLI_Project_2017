some people hold the opinion that most advertisements tell customers the products much better than they are .others , however , have nagetive attitude .as far as i am concerned , i would like to vote for the agreement for this statement .the arguments for this point are listed as followed :first and foremost , the enlargement of the quality of some products in the ads is one of lots of reasons for inlustrate the phenominon of the adervertisement did not show the truth .for example , once a couple hang around in a mall , a saler of tv told them the high resolution of that tv is the best quality to enjoy .they bought it by costing more , but finnally they found the good quality only comes from the dvd presented in the mall .so , it is reason why most consumers do not believe what the saler said .there is another factor that deserves some words here .the ads always show fake feasure of the products .for instance , the picture of the products showed online .once you buy a good looking stuff online , do not feel so happy at once that you got a great deal to have your favorate thing .you maybe need to wait for the last moment that you recieve the shipped item you bought several days ago .in addition , the gurantee of some produces doe not only want to show the coustomer their items have good lasting quality , but also want adding a attractive thing for asking you buy them .if you finnally make a decision to buy them because of the gurantee policy , you may fall in a trap .from i have discussed above , the enlargement of the quality of products , the more preety but not real picture of the products , and the fake gurantee for the stuff are all the ads showed the products much better than they really are
