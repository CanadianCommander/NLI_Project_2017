i disagree with the idea that understandig ideas and concepts is more important than learing facts .it is more important to learn , even if you do nt know exactly what something means , because if you can learn how to apply what you ve learned in real life , then you wo nt forget about it .one of the main objectives of a student is to learn , or at least it should .there are several factors that could change the goals of a student , or even the results of what they ve learned .in order to learn , you can use real-life examples to understand a concept in a better way , and that s an easy way to learn .when your teacher uses easy examples in the class , sometimes you do nt even realize thay you re learning until you remember that particular example in the real world .and i think that s the best way to learn , because you might not even try to learn and you do it anyway .in my personal experience , i love teachers who explain something to me in a simple way .one of them is by giving examples you might know , or some experiences you might had .and the best of all is that , one day without any effort , you remember what your teacher tought to you , and the example he/she gave you .it is very important that teachers try their best to make students consider that is more important to learn the facts instead of memorizing a concept .because if you do that , maybe you will know the definition during the class , during the week , or during the course .but if you never use that concept again , or if you do nt even care about knowing how to apply what you re learning in your real life , then it would be like if you did nt learn a thing .it is really important to be aware of this important aspect in learning , and it s a homework we all have to accomplish :- students in order to be better prepared , and- teachers in order to improve students  learning .
