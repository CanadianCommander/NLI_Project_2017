learning is an important phase in everyones life .some students concentrate more on understanding ideas and concepts while some concentrates to learn facts .in my opinion both must go parallel in order to have an effective learning process .they has to be content about the facts and then they has to understand them by learning concepts .mere reading of facts can not give a detailed explanation about the overall concept .some practical knowledge is required to exploit the situation .most of the students learn concepts by reading the textbook .some concepts may not be understandable when we read them .we have to do some experiments regarding them , these creates some new and innovative ideas in the minds of children .for example , let us take lightening as an example .when chindren learn about the process of lightening thay are not fully satisfied about the process .but when they see the process through eyes they can realise that light travels faster than sound .that is the reason why we first see the light and then hear the sound .so by this example it is clear that students should understand ideas and concepts than mere learning facts from the textbook .in my school days my teachers would always insist to know about the concept behind a fact .teacher plays an impotant role in this process .they has to create some prototypes which explains the concept about the fact .moreover the student absorbs the fact when it is stated practically because students learn more from doing than from reading .but it is equally important to read about the facts because they must have the minimum capability to understand the idea of what teacher is going to explain .once they are ready with the facts and concepts they can face any problem easily .moreover this type of learning instigates zeal to exploit new things and this will definitely help them in the future education also .so in conclusion i would like to state that the process of learning must be balanced enough to have a better understanding of the facts supported by learning the concepts behind the facts .
