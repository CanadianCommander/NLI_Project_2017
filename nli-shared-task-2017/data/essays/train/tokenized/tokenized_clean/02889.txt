the advertisement is first made to introduce the product to the customers , as the mess media keep developing and became popular source of advertising the advertisement skill is also developing .there are three ingredients of advertisement that is essential to convince the customers the products seems better than what the product really is .first one is the visual impact of the product .this usually can be seen in homeshopping programmes in television , such as food .all the products that are introduced in the programmes seems tasty and good , the products that are shown in the progammes are well-made .however , this might not be true sometimes when one actually got the product , the customers might be dissapointed to see different , or less-well-made , product as one never thought it to be .secondly , the sound impact of the advertisement can also convince the customer to misconception of the product .many scients indicated the power of sound can change the mood of a person .sometimes the advertisers use popular songs , raps , or even classical music on their tv advertisement in order to make the customer s mind into calmness , excitement or eagerness .the customers , when they sees the cfs , might like the product just because he/she are unconsciously fallen into the background music .lastly , the impact of the famous person .for those who only cares about what the product is , not who the product introduce the product , this might seems awkward .however , people who are casted by the cf managers earn millions of dollars , this indicates the power of the celebertises in the advertisement market .most commonly , in movies if a famous actor/actress or even some famous basketball player is casted , that movie seems to be successful just by advertising whether the movie is well-made or not .to summarize my opinion , i firmly believe that the advertisements are convincing the customers into a misconception of the product , by making the product seems better than what they really are .the overusing of this three ingredients of advertisement are now becoming the one of the biggest problem that united states and all the world s media has .
