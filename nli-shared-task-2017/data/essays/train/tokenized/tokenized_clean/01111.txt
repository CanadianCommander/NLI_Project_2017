` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  , i think that this statement is true and based on my experience i am going to explain why i agree with it .when i was younger , i have been fooled by advertisements several times .one of the better example is when i decided to lose weigth , i saw at the telivision , peels that seemed like magic because without any effort , users could lose a lot of weight and very quickly .of course , these pills did not work as well as the advertise said , however it helps me to understand that the purpose of advertisements is to sell a product and to tell to the clients what tey want to hear .on one hand , i think it is quite normal for an advertise to only talks about the advantages of a product , even if it is a kind of lie not to tell to the clients everything that they have to know about the product .on the other hand , it can be really annoying for an user to see that it is harder than in the advertisement to make the product works .for instance , it is always making me laugth when i watch my mother trying to use a very complex oven that she bougth because the old one did not have all the functions of the new one .she never achieves to correctly put the alarm , thus the food is nowadays too much cooked .however , now before i buy something quite expensive , i always go on the internet to watch the points of view of users .this is very helpful , for example , when i decided to buy a new laptop i spent over a month to compare the producer s advertisements and comments from users .furthermore , i think that when the promises of a product s advertise and reality are close that shows the seriousness of the producer .
