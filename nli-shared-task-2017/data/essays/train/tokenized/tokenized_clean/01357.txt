i would like to answer this question by introducing what that means : enjoy life .if people enjoy their lifes or not depends on many things .firstly , it could depend on your hobbies , like playing basketball or fishing .both are completely different and you might say that fishing more fits to older people whereas basketball more fits to younger people .secondly , it depends on your social circumstances .this means some people enjoy spending time with there family .others like to go to parties whenever possible .this also can be related to the age .additionally it could depend on the education .higher educated people maybe would like to visit an opera rather than hanging around in a bar .today a lot of people think education was much better in former times .nevertheless i believe younger people enjoy life more for several reasons ( but this answer is somehow biased , because i think i am young ) .all the reasons mentioned above can not lead to an adequate answer from my point of view , because that are personal things .younger people enjoy life more , because they have less responsibilities .so younger people have more space to be spontanous than older people have .furthermore younger people are in average healthier , what gives them the possibility of doing more things in shorter period of time .in addition there is a lot of stuff to discover , what older people may have discovered already .the advantage of older people is that they have usally more money for enjoing life , but i believe that caused by todays globalization it becomes less important .everything becomes cheaper and money is not required for enjoying life .to conclude this essay i would say that younger people can enjoy life more because of the reasons mentioned above .but what does it really mean to be old .just few people would call themselves old .you are just that old , how old you are feel .
