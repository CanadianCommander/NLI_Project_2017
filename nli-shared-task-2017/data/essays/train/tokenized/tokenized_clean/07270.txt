there has been a lot of change in the behaviour and attitude of the youth towards their communities nowadays as compared to earlier times .today , young people are more concerned about their own personal development rather than the developement of the communtiy they live in .because of more professional competition between people and a desire to move up the success ladder , people have forgotton their social responsibilties .they have forgotton what their community has given to them and what their duties are .young people leave no stone unturned to be successful and work with all energy and detremination for their own growth .but they often have lack of time for helping their communities , most of the youth are not concerned and sometimes are not even aware of who their neighbours are and about the societies they live in .in earlier days , youth worked hard for community upliftment .for example , swami vivekananda , apart from his personal growth , also worked for improving the status of women in the society .his followers preached his ideas and principles and this led to the betterment of the society .such examples are rare to be seen now .advances in science and technology have helped the society but have also brought many mishaps .people are thought of as machines , who work day and night without worrying about their parents who would be waiting for them at home .youth have forgotton towards their responsibility towards their own parents .youth have taken to several different forms of entertainment as a source of passing their time .in their free time , they would surf the net or hang out with friends .to give an example , many of my college mates pay no attention to the news or any natural calamities .they are only concerned about them and their relatives .this trend can be easily seen in case of a calamity like droughts , floods where people above the age of 40 are actively involved in the helping the affected people .youths are preoccupied with other non significant issues like a party at their friends place or a routine get together .hence , with the help of the above mentioned points i conclude that youth nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
