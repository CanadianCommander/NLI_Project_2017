many people on earth are said to only care about their own little person .it is surely true .but no one could ever say that they do not contribute to helping their communities .directly or not , willing or not , everyone does help his community , as everything is nowaday done for the good rolling of society .yound people are no exception and i would say that they contribute more than any other category of person to the development of a healthy society .here is a very simple exemple .mark , twenty-year-old student in biology .mark leaves in a flat as most students do .he has a part-time job in a fast-food restaurant to pay his bills and does a job no one would like to do for him .he has no choice but to work but helps his community by making nice tasty hamburgers to two hundred of people a day , making them happy as they eat the best burgers in their life .going to a fast-food does nt seem that exciting , but some people do it on a regular basis .this would nt be possible without mark .moreover , by studying biology , mark will one day fill the empty space left by an old and tired citizen in an hospital or in a laboratory making research for cancer .we can say that mark contribute twice to helping his community by feeding its inhabitants and assuring its future health as he studies .no one can say that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because , as they make their way through life , they are assuring the survival of this community : by studying and by doing different jobs no one wants to hear about .another aspect of young people s actions for their community simply is their wish to travel .lots of cultural exchanges are made in high-schools and colleges .this allows communities to know more about other cultures in the world , to be more open-minded and comprehensive toward people of other background , that may be leaving in the neibourghoods .it stengthens the links inside the community and between different communities .
