i agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .while there are many reasons for my belief , two of the most important ones are that they can explain to every one the ideas that they learned and they can use those ideas in their personal life .these beliefs deserve further examination in order to understand my belief that the students can learn easier any idea when they understand completly it .the first reason of my belief that the students will have the capacity of explain not only to the techer , but also to anybody what he understand with many details .for example , when any student have completly understanding what he is doing can have easier knowledge of the idea that he is working .one of the best experiences that i had ever had was when i was student and i learned to to mix the quemicals in the chemistry lab , i really coud have my mind on it and i knew the reason why , so i could help some of my friends .therefore understand what we see and read is the basic part to learn .next , if the student understood in a clear way some ideas he will be able to use it in his personal life .he can find the reason why learn and understand have a bonding that help to memorise easier .for instance , understand concepts helps to develop the concentration .concequently , the student shoul have more concentratrion about more issues .in conclusion , have a good understanding of concepts and ideas is a basic issue for learn .if a student understand clarly can have much more opportunities in his future life because will be able to demonstrate his capacities
