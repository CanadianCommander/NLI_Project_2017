some people said that travels with guides are boring and noneffective because they have to move according to maden plans .but i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .to begin with , guides provide services for travelers to enjoy the well-known places for its fullest .because guides have lots of knowledge of places , travelers are not needed to prepare to know about them .as a result , they can spend remained time to enjoy the travel .for example , when i was in high scool , i went to je-ju island .a beautiful guide helped me to acquire a number of information i d never known and i remember the full story of je-ju island until now .on top of that , we do nt have to make plans owing to guides .usually people make an effort to plan where to eat and sleep , and what route to go through .but guides get rid of all concerns .because they have already held many travels and had maden plans .we are required to just enjoy the travel .we ca nt watch places that are not in plans , of course .but we are able to get enough information .if i have a chance to travel , i would like to go to america .it has very extended territories and many beautiful sceneries .but i do nt know where to go first , sleep and eat .although i can prepare the plan through many books , but i have no time to spend to it .in conclusion , i have to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
