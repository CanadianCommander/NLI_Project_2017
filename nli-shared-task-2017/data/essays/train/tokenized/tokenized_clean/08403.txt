first of all , it has to be metioned that the concept of ` enjoying life  is dramatically different for a teenager and for an older person .even if this concept should be present in life from the cradle to the grave .on the one hand , it is generally accepted that young people are physically more capable than older people .as a result , they will normally not enjoy life by doing the same kind of things .indeed , going out in a club on saturday night is surely quite unusual for most elderly people .they may prefer to travel on an organized trip or to read a good book .older people also have the advantage of being retired , which allows them to have more time for leisure , holidays abroad , etc ,on the other hand , young people usually have less experience in life and have a tendency to make `` youth mistake  .they are usually less wise in making decisions and will sometimes face a lot of problems .furthermore , young people get more and more responsabilities as they become older .for instance , the ones who study have to attend classes regularly , to do homework , to write a memoire or a these on a particular subject .others will have to work , to care for their children or face money problems .indeed , generally speaking , older people tend to have less money problems because they are not menaced by unemployment and mainly have their accomodation mortgage paid .undeniably , less responsabilities give you more time to enjoy life .however , in my opinion , enjoying life is not really a matter of age , i feel that quotes like `` life begins with 40  are totally wrong .for me , life begins every morning when you wake up .in conclusion , we were all given the choice to do what we want with our life and should take advantage of this opportunity .life is short and enjoying it every single day , regardless of either you are young or old is definitely a conditio sine qua none to happiness .
