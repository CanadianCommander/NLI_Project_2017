who does nt know advertisements for for sporting articles , like nike or adidas or for cars , like the new mercedes or simply for foods , like milk ?in these advertisements the products are looking always good or are nt they ?so the question what i want to discuss now is , if the advertisements make products seem much better , than they really are .on the one hand i think that the products that are advertised are very , very bad , because it is often shown only the whole article and in most of the cases never the details .you only have to look at the case of food , because there are often pesticides found , when this food gets tested in labors .i think everybody can remember the chocolate chaos at the big supermarket hofer in austria .also the advertisement of cars looks always superb , but in reality there are so many failures , as i have seen on the car of my father .with this car we always had problems , because the electric was not well working .as a result of these failures there will also be danger for humans be affected , from the bad technic , as well as from the underaverage bad food .but on the other hand i think , that the products , which are shown in an advertisement are really as good as they seem , because behind this products it is very often a lot of innovation .who does nt know the nike air system in shoes ?it was a simple development in the past , but today still works , because the people know , that this is as good as in the advertisement .moreover i think , that products , which have been tested for long terms by the companies , will increase more and more on quality and finally it is possible to itentify this product with the advertisement .as a conclusion i would say , that neot everybody should look only at the advertisements .
