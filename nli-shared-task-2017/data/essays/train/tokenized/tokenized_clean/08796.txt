yes , this right .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because most products think they are better than the other .like two people play a game , some times , the loser will think the winner does nt better than him , just because he was lack .even the winner win the game so easy , the loser think the winner just same leavel to himself .so they always think themself is better , so they would nt listen to any body .they think they are always ture , becaues they are better than the other .
