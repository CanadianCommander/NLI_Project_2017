i agree .the students should understand the ideas that they are studying .the learning process is not about memorize chapters and concepts , it is about understanding and analyzing .if they understand the ideas and concepts they would not have problems to `` learn facts  .they would be capable of solve problems , which is the idea .education is about what the student is capable to do , per example , if the student has a bad situation , a problem or other struggles , his proof would be try to find by himself what he needs to do to get out of the situation .his level of education would help him to analyze the problem and then , solve it .this man will think about what he has learned and after that he will find a conslussion for his problem .other example , would be a person without any educational level .this person would not be capable of get a fast conslussion because he has not had any educational help in all his life , which means that he has not developed his razoning part at school .for this reason , education is not just a word that indicates `` go to school  ( college or universities , in other cases ) , it is a word that indicates : `` analyzing  , `` logical  or `` learning  .if some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pass that subject , he would use his logical skills to solve the problem .the most logical response to this situation would be go with a tutor to get help .i do not agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn facts because would be a support to those people who just memorize things and they call smart to themselves .in some situation would be good to learn facts , but it would not be the point of the educational matter .the point is try to learn and analyze situations in life .for these reasons , the understanding is most important in a student  educational process .
