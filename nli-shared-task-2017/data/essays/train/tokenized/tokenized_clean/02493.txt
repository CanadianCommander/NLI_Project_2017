the issue of whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts .some people assert that understanding concepts is more important , while others believe that learning facts is more important .different people have different views due to their distinct backgrounds .as a matter of fact , this issue is complex and controversal one and whether one choice takes precendence ovr the other may quite depend one the specific situation .as far as i am concerned , i disagree with this statement and my view can be substantiated by the following discussion .the first argument can be presented is ideas and concepts are usually unrealistic and un-practical .a good example is about my major - physical therapiest .many of classmates could get good scores in the lecture , but they could not get good scores in the lab or being interns in the hospital because they could make a good connection between what they had learned and the clinic situation .under this circumstance , i really think learning facts is very important .in addtion , there is another reasons to support my standpoint and a good example is not far to seek .before going abroad , people buy the travelling guide book and understand the environment and culture of the country to which they are going .but sometimes , people feel what the book mentions is too abstract to understand and therefore , the best way is going that country and have the real experience .admittedly , it may be true understanding ideas and concepts is very basic and important for students in some specific situation .however , this alone does nt constituate a sufficienct support to claim above statement .actually , these cases are rare and thus are too specific and too weak to strenthen this standpoint .when the advantages and disadvantages of understanding concepts and learing facts are carefully examined , the most striking conclsuion is abvious that learing facts is much more important .to sum up , although the statement still arouses diagreement among different people , the issue is quite difficut to resolve .taking into account the above-mentioned reasonses , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become to be more persuasive , we can arrive at the conclusion learing fact is more important to students than undersatdning ideas and concepts .
