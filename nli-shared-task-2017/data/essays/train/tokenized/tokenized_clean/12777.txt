we live in a big and diverse world , and the only way to know it , learn about its different cultures and participate in new experiences is by traveling .travelling needs to be done with enough preparation and interest so the trip results in a pleasant one .therefore , i think that the best way to travel is without a tour guide because it helps you to experiment a different culture , get in contact with the people that live in that place and experiment real relaxation .first , i think that travelling without a tour guide and helps you experiment a different culture .tour guides mostly focus on turistic places , places where large crowds of people prowl and it is almost impossible to find a quiet place to observe the beauthiful attractions that place offers .so , if travelling consists of hanging with crowds of people i better stay home and go to the stadium .second , when travelling all by yourself you get the chance to get in contact with the local people , an experience that can not be compared .travelling consists not only watching but experimenting different cultures .when you travel you must take the time to learn about local people and it customs .therfore i cant think of a better way of getting aquainted with another culture than by travelling all by yourself , visiting exotic cities and talking to old people that were born and would die in the place you are visiting .third , by travelling without a tour guide you can really relax by doing what you please when you please .when you are travelling with more people and led by a tour guide , it is rare the ocassion you can do what you want , you must always keep with the group .to all the places you go , there will always be the sound of people joking and laughing making it impossible to relax .so , travelling in a group ca nt be called a holiday .travelling is a privilege that here in ecuador few people can afford , but when someone decides to travel , i think he must always do it without a tour guide .when traveling on your own you should consider your ability to dont get lost and reach places with a map as your only guide .but i strongly recommend people to take the risk because at the end , the experience adquired is unforgettable and it will always compense the hours spent looking for a place that in the map seemed very easy to get .
