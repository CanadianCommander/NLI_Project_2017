i totally agree with the satement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .it is somehow true that successfull people always try to do new things involving high risks to see their capibility to fight with the world .some people only try new things because of their high interest innvolved in that particular field .when a new born baby come to this world , he doe not know anything about reading , eating , and other activities of our daily life .as our life moves on , the child comes to know new things like how to eat poperly , how to play , how to write , and so on , which helps child understand life better .it also helps understand people with different beliefs and opnions .doing what a person already knows will not help anyone in any way .for example , if a person has finished his school and wants to become a scientist , he will not be successful and will not reach his goal until he study futher doing some experiments and researchs .one should always try hard to understand new things and apply them to their daily life .if a person is unsuccessful in his first attempt , he should not stop practicing thinking that he in uncapable of doing it , however , he should bring some fantasy in himself and should redirect his negative feelings into positive activities .one should always remember the most couraging line that `` practice makes a man perfect  .there is a story of a spider who tries to climb a high wall to reach his web .he falls again and again even before he completes half of its way to his web .but he never stops trying having faith that , one day he will reach to the top .his positive attitude towards life and his practice makes him successful leading him to to his web one day .this story is a good example
