i agree that people sould keep tring new things nomatter they already know what to do , because of they keep tring new things , and have new ideas , it let us devolope many new things , and when everything keep getting better , it s mean that we are keeping process .they keep finding new things , so our tecknowlege can be really good these day .because when the new things come out people will use it for sometimes , but after that people will wants to use better things , so they will tring to find so more convenience things to use .if people did nt try to make some new products , and people wo nt support them .like music , althout every composers follow privent composers , they still will try to add many differents idea in the music , or broke the rule , and built the new rule , than it will bring the music to the other peried .when we compered these days music and the romaness music .it s not only the style very different .we can also find many differents interest things on it , because we learn what s the idea of the music before , and what we can do some new , or make the sounds different , so music will keep changing by day to day .people have to keep tring the new things and take new risks , not only doing what they already know how to do , that will let our life become very boring , because we want to make our world and our life better and better , not just staying at the some step .
