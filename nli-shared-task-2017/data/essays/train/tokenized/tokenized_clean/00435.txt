success sleeps in realitypeople who are in the search of new things and like to take risks rather than doing in well-known form may be considered successful when it is heard .however , i totally disagree with this idea of desire towards new things and risks for several reasons .the first reason that supports my idea is that time is the most valuable concept in human life , and it should nt be wasted .it means that someone should run after empty dreams or the ideas that increases the slope of life , for human life is short .for example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lots of mad scientists who dreamed lots of mad things including `` navigation in time  , but if one looks at the results , there is nothing to applaude .descartes , mathemetician and philosopher , can be considered a nice example for life , for the he was so successful although he did nt dream or take risks .the second reason , that one should nt try new things and take risks , is the comprehension of the primitive knowledge ; that is to say , people may try to learn the theories or methods that have been already accepted by the authorities .before creating or commenting , the knowledge should be enlarged as much as possible .by the way , instead of trying new things or taking risks , one can profit from its own knowledges or try to be satisfied in his borders .for example , if an engineer learns the current progressions in his major and improves himself , he does nt need to try new things or take risks to be succesful , because he is aldready succesful .all in all , as the reasons are shown , i think that the idea of resting in peace of its borders , and following my life as it flows is better idea
