i do not agree with the statement saying there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .first of all , car industries will not allow such thing to happen .in some companies , cars are deliberately built to last less than 10 years , so the owners will buy new cars more often .they consistently produce more cars and ways to encourage people to buy and use them .in some countries , even the government encourages automobile consuming .those countries build more and more roads and also expand the already existing ones , so more cars can easily get on the road .the government , or the city planner , could have built more railways and mass transportation instead of more roads if they wanted to reduce traffic and pollution , but the government fears that the automobile industry , which is a major part of the country s economic , will fail to increase if they take such policies .building more roads instead of building complicated mass transport system might also be in fact a cheaper solution , and the only solution available at that time for reducing traffic in the short term .the second aspect of using cars is that the people who have been driving will not easily go back to walking or using mass transportation unless it is a much better substitute for driving .driving and having an own car gives you the kind of privacy not easily gained by using mass transport , and going back to an old habit needs a lot of determination .the types of cars used today might be used fewer in the future , but new and better types or cars will dominate the future .the downside of driving was to have to concentrate on driving and keep an eye on the road , but more and more technical developement allow drivers to drive less and let the artificial intelligence do the work .there will also be cars with less , hopefully no pollution .the cars will almost definately be much less noisy than the ones today .the comfort of driving or riding on cars will consistently increase , because the companies investigate for reserches in those areas .because of these reasons , the overall number of cars and the usage of them is more likely to increase than decrease .
