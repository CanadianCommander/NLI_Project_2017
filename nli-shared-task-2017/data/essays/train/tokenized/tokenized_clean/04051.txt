i believe that two decades from now we shall have fewer cars than there are today .to achieve a sustainable development , already many countries are discouraging use of private transport and framing rules and regulations that will lead to mass acceptance of public transport .moreover , with advancements in transport technology , alternative modes of transport will develop .world population is increasing at tremendous rate .with rise in population increases the demand for travel since the total number of individuals increase so , one might think that future will show us growth in number of cars too .but , for this to happen infrastructure should also increase at the same pace .car building workshops will have to increase the capacity .pertroleum companies will have to dig more wells .but , from where are they going to find the resources !people can not go on exploiting environment in the way they want to achieve their comfort of travelling in their own car .there is growing world consciousness that one can not sacrifice the development of future generation to become merrier today .hence , many countries of the world , like us , brazil , singapore , india have embarked upon a novel and ambitious project of `` sustainable development  .various organisations like international energy agency and world bank work together with many countries under this project to create a better future .rules and regulations have been framed to popularise public transport .with time certainly demand for personal transport will go down and so will be the number of cars .moreover , if one were to go by temporal relationship between science depicted in movies and technolgy in the day-to-day world , one will see that whatever a fiction writer or movie director imagines has come true in about few years from the inception because of science .for instance , a ` submarine  imagined in `` twenty thousand leagues under the sea  ( a book by r.l.stevenson )was made a reality few years after its publication .hence , it would not be preposterous to believe that we will have our own personal flying automobiles as shown in the movie `` the fifth element  .in fact , if humans are able to colonise in space e.g. moon , there shall be more space vehicles and less cars .one might also envisage a `` particle transporter  as seen in `` star trek  .then there shall not remain a need for anyone to have a car .given , the rapid development and promises offered by science all this seems quite achieveable within next two decades .hence , it can be safely said that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years down the line .
