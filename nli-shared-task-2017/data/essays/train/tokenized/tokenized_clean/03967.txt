can we say that success and creation are linked ?the main point is to make a difference between financial success and personal success .through a finanacial point of view .new things are not always successful .indeed , success as well as failure are parts of the risk .for instance , when you gamble in a casino , you can win but you also can win .maybe the first thing is to analyze what is to be successful .a successful person can also be the one who tries what he really wanted to try , the one who is not afraid of realizing his dreams .the issue of the try does nt influence the value of the act .which is taken into account is the will to realize his projects and achieve his deams .therefore , we can say that people who acts and reacts are successful poeple .they attract admiration and respect from the others .indeed , taking risks and trying new things are a proof of courage .trying new things can turn a person into a leader .even if the try ends up to be a failure , because it is new , it is always a start for something else new .in arts , surrealism , after the second wold war was rejected in favor of existentialism .the surrealists did nt change the world as they wanted to do it .nevertheless , they opened new possibilities of creation and they appeared as a new source of inspiration .they forced admiration because they were not afraid of chocking people and making fun of sensitive values like death and war .andre breton remains in france the representative of a successful movement .
