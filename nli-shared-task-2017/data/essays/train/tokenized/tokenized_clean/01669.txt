i m not sure that in twenty yers there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .probably many nations , for example china and india , will increase their number of cars because today in that states not many people have a car and many persons use the bike or go on their foot .but these nations now is working so much that i think that probably soon more people than now will have the money to choose and to buy a car .and we have to remember that in asia there are more than one billion of persons ( only in china there are now 1 , 2 billions of abitants ) !in europe ( expecially in the west europe ) and america ( naturally the north of america ) , instead , we are in a different situation : we have many cars and the traffic in our cities is very strong and dangerous for our life .many families has two or three cars and the italians spend many time in their cars : all days there are much traffic in all the most important streets of the country .maybe it will be better if many italians leave their car at home , so they would need of only a car for family , there would nt be the smog ( even if this would be a myracle ) and many people would be more happy .surely our nature and ambient would be more happy .but the situation of east europe is similar to china s one ; that part of europe is poor and i think that in future that states will became richer than now , so many other people will buy a new car .so i think that this problem has nt a solution : probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today , but probably there wo nt .only the time will can solve this partcular and difficult problem .
