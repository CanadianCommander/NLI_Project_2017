nowadays , young people are very busy studying or doing other things , so they do not volunteer to help their communities .in their teens they have to study for the university entrance test .other young people would play .they think that helping communities is very hard .in my community , every teenagers has to study for their own good .the fact that they spend the day studying , they do nt have enough time to help the community .i am a teenaged girl and i want to volunteer to support the town , but i do not have the time .i believe that young people would like to help the community .in their middle schools or high schools , if they have free time they would hang out with their friends .because they did the hard work studying , they want to rest .teenagers would like rest in their home playing computer games or watching tv .in my school , students have to work for the community for amount of the time , but they would ask their dad to make a certificate which prove that the student volunteered for the work .they think that helping the community means cleaning the streets , and doing dirty and hard works .students should give enough time to help communities , but they do nt .in one reason , students have to study for the university entrance test .even if they have the time to do the helping , students would play with their friends to relieve .many young people think that supporting thier towns is very hard work to do .
