i agree to the statement where i believe most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .such statement can be supported by my own personal experience and my friend s experience .through media , such as magazines and televisions , many products are advertised .many of the products seem very cheap and good in quality from the way they are presented .one day , i was watching an advertisement channel where they sold a hair removal spray .the advertiser showed how anyone can remove their hair by spraying on their hair and simply wiping it by a towel .the show also showed a person remoivng her hair through wax very painfully , trying to get across the point this product is better than any other method to remove hair .strongly convinced by the advertisement , i bought the spray and excitingly waited for its arrival .when the product arrived , i tried on the spray immediatly .i was dissapointed when the spray did not work at all .i kept spraying and wiping but my hairs never came off .from this experience , i realized how advertisements make product seems much better than they really are .another example that supports my opinion is through my friend s experience .my friend ordered a cosmetic magazine since she was interested in buying some make-up for herself .when she took a look at the cosmetic magazine , she was surprised at herself for not buying all of her cosmetic through magazine .the product were much cheapter and seemed better than buying at stores .she told me how she was never going to buy cosmetic products at sephora or other cosmetic stores .my friend ordered a pack of lip sticks through the cosmetic magazine and she was busy bragging about it to her other friends .however , when the lip sticks arrived , they were so much smaller than they appeared in the magazine .the lip sticks were only about 1 inch long .from then on , my friend learned to never order anything through magazines .from these two experiences described above , it can seen that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .we should all be causious of the advertisements and look into it carefully before buying any products .
