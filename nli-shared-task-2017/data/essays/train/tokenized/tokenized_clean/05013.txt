if i was plan to have trip , i would like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .in the modern life , when people want to have a trip they always face this problem that whether travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel by themselves .it is easy for everage people to choose travel by themselves , because they can spend their time on whatever they want and however they want .but if you can find out the advantage of travelling in a group led by a tour guide you will know it deeply .the first advantage of travelling in group led by a tour guide is that people do not need to catch the plane , book the hotel and so on .the tour company will take care of that , and people do not need worry about missing plane the tour guide will mention you when it is ready to go .besides travelling in a group led by a tour guide is savetime .because the tour guide know that where is more interesting that you should spend more time to visit .and the tour guide can explain the background of the landscapes well , because they were trained by the company and special school .finally , it will save lots of money if people choose tracvel in a group led by a tour guide .usually when people give the money to the tour company .the money will cover the tickets , the hotels , and meals , and the tour company can get much more discount than you get .so it s really a goodway to travel in group led by a tour guide .athough it also has drawbacks , such as people can not spend time in the way they want .but it is said that `` everythind has two sides  both of these choise has there advantages and disadvantages .but by giving the reason as above .it s fair to say that travel in a group led by a tour guide is a better choise .
