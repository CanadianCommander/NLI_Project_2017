in my opinion i feel that there would not be as many cars as there are today .there are several reasons to justify my statement .one reason , i feel that in another twenty years or so there would be fewer cars is because of the very fact of increase in population growth .for example , in this present situation the popullation of people have increased in billion and traffic has increased too .this discomfort the people travelling as they spend precious time in traffic jams .hence , many are opting for public transportation as driving your cars in the present traffic situation is more of a discomfort than pleasure .secondly , technology is developing to a huge extent and in another twetnty years or so i am sure we would have more convenient transport which is faster , reliable and comfortable would be used .so people do nt have to worry about the traffic jams involved .another reason that i feel that there would be fewer cars is because the medium of fuel for cars is petrol or diesel and this being a non renewable source , it has to be used judiciously .a point would come when people themselves realises the importantance in conserving these non renewable .in that particular movement i am sure the number of cars would gradually decrease .furthermore people would have to start using more ecological way of travelling as the pollution is increasing day by day and when the number of vechicles increases , so does the pollution this would be harmfull for the environment .for example due to the chloro fluro carbons our ozone layer has a huge hole which allows harmfull ultra violet rays to penetrate , thus leading to skin cancers and melting of the ice caps in the antartic region , gradually increasing the sea levels leading to many islands sub merging .gradually the government would realises the harmfull effects and introduce other means of transport .in addition , fewer cars are expected to be in the next twenty years owing to the fact that in twenty years people might be intrested in other gadgets that could take them around .as we know as human we are intrested in owing the latest gadgets than being happy with the gadgets we own .for example the latest addition is the flying hanover craft - this basically gets you to near by places .perhaps in twenty years we may have other gadget which would ultimately replace cars .to sum it it up i feel that in twenty years or so we can expect the number of cars to go down due to various reasons like pollution , depletion of non renewable resources and technological improvement .
