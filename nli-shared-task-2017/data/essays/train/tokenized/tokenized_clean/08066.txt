i agree the statement that a people who want to be success shoud try new things and take risks rahter than only doing the regular things .the first reason , we can not get more success from the regular things .if the things already know how to do well , then there is nothing need us to do .it s hard to do them better .then why not to try a new thing or take a risk ?normal people always use the regular ways to deal with the common things .so they can not get success .let s see the successful people , almost of them are begin with trying new things or take risks .the first step of be successful is to try it , to take a risk .the second reason is that people always be successful from trying new things and taking risks .it s not easy to try a new thing or take a risk , because you always will be laughed by the others .the first step is very difficult to do .but when you did it , you will fell much more difficult , because you must pay more time and work harder .the way to success is not a normal way , so just a few guys can get it .trying new things and take risks are not equal to be successful , but it s the first step to success .if you want to be a successful people , you must to do it .if inventors do nt want to try the new things , they ca nt invent anything .if they did nt try , maybe we have nt light , car or computer , maybe we still live in the stone age .so we can get that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
