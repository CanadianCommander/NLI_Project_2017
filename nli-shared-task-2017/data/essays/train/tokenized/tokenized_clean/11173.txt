some people think that advertisements show the the real quality of products , but i do not .this is because , the products which we buy are not the same like the products which are exhibited in the advertisement .moreover , for the sake of more selling , they do not worry to say lies .whether you believe it or not , the quality of products is different from the products exhibited in advertisements .when we buy a machine .it do not last as they mention in the advertisements .moreover , if we take a dress which we saw in the adds , we often realize that it is not the same in the adds .in my oppinion , the fact that a product is showed in the advertisements means that this product is not brought as much as expected .did you notice that the the most famous brands do not show their selves in the advertisements like the others do .they sell their products with quality and the creativity .although , the more advertisements are , the more buying potential is .this does not means that advertisements say always truths .they almost always say the wrong thing for the sake of more selling potential .they reach almost all the places , from our houses to our office .unfortunately , we see the all the these lies on tv and computer , and even in newspaper .morthey spread their lies wherever we liveall in all , what we see on the advertisements does not mean that it is true .in my oppinion the only way to sell their bad products is to say lie on the advertisements .
