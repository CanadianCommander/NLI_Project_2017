i believe , that when students are exposed to many different information , many chose to understand only the information which attracts their curiosity .in this case , the other left over facts which did not interest them , are only stored for a short period of time .usually , these information are stored for sometime , but are eventually forgotten .this is because humans are only capable of storing a certain amount of information in their brain .due to this fact , i agree to the statement , and believe that understanding of ideas are more important than storing more facts .students are tested , quized , and marked for their knowledge in everyday basis .they have grades which marks their progress in learning , which affects their future , such as college application .in order to enter a desirable school , students are forced to learn information which might not interest them .for example , if a student wishes to major in mathematics , he does not need to learn about great poets of the english language .however , he will not chose to not learn these pointless facts .this is because it will simply affect his overal grades if he does not learn them .basically , he is forced to learn facts which are not wanted .if they are not desirable these facts that are learned , will be forgotten .this is due to the fact that the student will not come back to these facts after learning them .there are massive amounts of facts which are learned , but put to waste because they are simply not interested by the learners .in order to understand ideas and concepts , your mind must reach the deepest core of its meaning .this is a extremely difficult task , and many will fail without grasping the goal .however , if a man understands , it is highly unlikely to forget the idea or concept .this achivement will be kept in his/her mind , and at somepoint in their lives , will return to help them .the experience is simply more real to them , thus they will be able to use it in everyday life .humans are not perfect creatures , and their skills in learning have limits .they can not process , interpret , analyze information which are too much for them .in addition , if a person learns facts which are not desirable , or interesting , they will be forgotten .people do so , because they are forced to earn good grades with their super ficially aquired facts , so they can go to a better school .i believe this is a waste of time .if students understand ideas , these are likely to be true knowledge which will never be forgotten .i believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because they are memorable , and strong knowledge .undesirable facts are potencial `` memory wastes  , and should not be obtained forcefully .
