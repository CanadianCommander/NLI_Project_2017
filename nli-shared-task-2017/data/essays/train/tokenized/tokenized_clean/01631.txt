some of the people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , and some not .i think it is better to get broad knowledge from many academic subjects .if my country allow this way , i believe i used to select this method but unfortunately i could nt .one of the adventages of this way is that it is not easy to forecat the ability of the students in the begining of the university .i think in my country most of the university students do not like their subjects .because our university selecting system does not reflect the students abilities .all people who graduated from college should attend to an exam .after getting the score from this exam they should fill a form about the sections and universities and they should sequenced these choices from the highest score of preview year to lower .at the end they start one of them or try to get enough score in the following year .if these student get any chance to select more than one university or section i think it will increase the rate of pleasure of students about their sections .the other reason for my choice about after graduation .during university years , students can not imagine their rest of lifes certainly .because in my country the relations between university and industry is very weak .so students can not get information about their jobs during lessons .after graduate most of the students could nt make their dream works .this cause unsatisfied people and unhappy families .but if they could get any second subject they can select one of them after start to work and get real information about their bussiness life .i am an engineer and i do not like make engineering .fortunetly after start to job i promoted to management and i find out my dream work .i believe i created by god for management and i like very much to manage the people .finally i can say that to create more happy publics  goverments should change the rules and allow to people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
