i completley disagree with the statment presented in this section .to posses any form of knowlege is an advantage for any individual .however , stating that it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects as opposed to specializing in one subject is a complete error .there are many reasons which serve to justify this claim .one , reason which serves as a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a `` broad knowledge in many subjects  there would be no one to specialize in specific subjects and this would hinder any advancments in subjects that are not studied specifically .the statement that having knowledge in one specific subject as being less beneficial then having knowledge in many subjects greatly contradicts the way our world operates today .if in today s world we did nt have people who mastered and speciffically looked into subjects where would we be in terms of advancment .for example , when looking at an individual who specialilzes in computers , if they had just had knowledge in many academic subjects then how can we see any potential for improvments .when an individual specializes in a field or subject they contribute to the advancments and discoveries , which in the long-run will benifet our society as a whole .another example which may be included to illustrate the contradiction of the statement presented in this section is if everyone `` only had a broad knowledge of many subjects  then where would we be in the medecine field .with an increase in diseases and viruses in today s world it is necessary to specialize in specific subjects , that way we can improve the society we live in .to have a broad knowledge in many subjects , and no specific knowledge in some subjects would be a disaster to mankind .this is because you would have to picture a world with no technological , no medicene advancment and a world void of what our society needs to prosper and become a better place .
