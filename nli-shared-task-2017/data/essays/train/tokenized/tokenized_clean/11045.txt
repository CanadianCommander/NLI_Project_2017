the question being asked wheather successful people should try new things and take risks or they should keep on doing what they already know and what they already do .this is an interesting topic since it is related with risk-taking by the people .in my opinion , i believe that people should try new things and try to take risks if they can .i think , if we do some thing for a long time than we would already improve that skills and we would get bore of doing one thing again and again .and being a successful person there would be less chances of loss .or if there might any loss occured than it will not affect that person business much more .and , if we would do some different things it can be good as far as change is concerned .if we have capability to take risks and to improve ourself than there is nothing wrong in taking risks .i am a pharmacist , so being a pharmacist i believe in research and development .and in research and development i try to innovate more and more useful drugs which have low side effects and have high margin of safety .and for that purpose i believe in taking risk in changing already existing formula of any perticular formulation or drug .which can help me to invent new drug which is more advantageous than the existing drug .so , according to me , we should keep on trying to do new thing apart from what we do in our day to day curriculum .furthermore , i thing , during present time where each and every person try to gain more and more knowledge as compared to others .and for this everyone has to take more chances to improve his skills and to become better than others .for example , if some one would not have taken risk of developing atomic bomb than we would not have been aware of that .in conclusion , i have shown that successful person should try new things and take risks .since without risks , there will not be any development .
