ok !today we talk about be a successful person .some people think that be a successful person , you need to try new things and take risks .another group of people think that do the things they already know and try to do it as best as they could .wow , these two ways are seems that sounds work .what do you think ?now , i tell you my opinion , i agree that be success is to try new things and take risks .well , i am not saying that you wo nt be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it as well as you could .waht i mean is `` improvement is come form trying  .we need to built up our own success we need to try to take the risks .ok , let say you in a football team you are the kicker .you work really hard to kick the football everyday and you keep every single step to kick .what you try to do is you never want to make a mistake .you want , once the ball is in front of you , you can kick it in .ok , finally you are the best kicker .but you forget something .the way you kick everyday is the old way .you did a wonderful job in kicking the football in old way .but there are a 1000 people in the world try to find out another better way to kick the football .so by the time they find that out , you are not the best anymore .no matter being success or be the best , is the same way to do that keep improve , keep try , take the risks and never give up .success is a compare word .you need someone next to you doing some thing less successful than you , then it will show that you are the one more successful .if you just stand in you own spot never go out to try , one day the people who try will pass you , if you still stay in that spot ten you will makre more people to pass you .so if you you really want to be successful people , you need to rtry new things and take risks .otherwise , somebody will pass you one day .( end )
