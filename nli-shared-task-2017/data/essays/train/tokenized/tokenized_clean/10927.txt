although it is good to specialize in one subject , i agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first , even if you are interested in that one subject you study , you had better to see other subjects .seeing other ranges will be helpful to enlarge your knowledge .if you see many things and read many kinds of books , your brain and feelings will be soft and you can learn more things than before .secondly , it will also help you to make it sure what you have learned .in one way , you can not know what is correct or not because your sight is narrow and small .if you learned something about the one specific subject , you can not say that in other subject the same .you have to see it from many ways or you can not judge it .and also , all academic subjects connect to each subject .we exist in this world and many materials exist together in a complex way as well .although each subject might look different at all , in fact , they are telling us about this world .unexpectedly , all subjects are same things .in sum , i support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects with those three reasons after all .
