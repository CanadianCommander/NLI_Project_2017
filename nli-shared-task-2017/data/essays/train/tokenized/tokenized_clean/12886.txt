i gree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i agree with that for many resons .such as , they will find many good ides , and a lot of diffrenet concepts .what every body knows that people learn facts by them selves , so it s less important to understand .what i think is more fun is that students really need to realize other people ideas and concepts .students will share ideas and concepts .furthermore , they will be involved .the most important thing that students will come up with many good ideas and concepts .therefore , it is more important for students to understand , realize , and consider ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .as what said before , that people can learn facts in their own life .what i need to mention is that fatcs are basic things .you ca nt change the fact or do anything with it .on the other hand , you can improve you idea and come up with a better one .that s i am agree with that students need to realize ideas and concepts .before i came to america , i did nt like it , but my cousin advised me to come .it was my cousin idea .every body has many ideas and concepts .one example is self help concept .that concept make people are independt , so they can do their own business .i was nt a self help concept before i came to america .now , i am a self help consept .i learned that in america because people in america are diffrent than people in my country , people here make their own business by them selves , but people in my country get help when they need .the fact that i am agree with statement is that people are able to imprve ideas and concepts but not fatcs .
