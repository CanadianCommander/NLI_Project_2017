i agree with the concept that most advertisements make products seem much better because i experienced the same event .being a consumer , i meet first with the new products in magazine or tv advertisement .if i get attracted to the advertisement , i wish to buy the product .thus , most advertisements exaggerate the good side of the product because the producers want the world to buy them .for example , most advertisements do not mention the side effects of drugs even though they can be pretty detrimental .one consumes drugs frequently whenever faced with illness .even though it is bad to take the loads of them , one takes it over and over again until the disease is gone .i am not sure about american advertisement , but in my home advertisement , there is no mention about side effects of the drug .there is not much chance that side effect will appear even 10 percent but i believe it is better to warn the cosumers with those beforehand .the producers do not mention about the side effects because they want their product to be sold .i believe this applies to any other products .thus , advertisment represent the product to be better than the real quality .for another example , advertisements do not show how long clothes or the whiteness of teeth last for .two years ago , i bought a box of `` white strip  .i did not pay attention to the lasting quality because the advertisement did not mention any of that sort .i tried them for a month and my teeth sure did get whiter but that was a temporary effect .after a month , my teeth were same as before if not worse .from that time on , i never buy those products again .consequently , the advertisement did not mention that the effect lasts temporarily because they want consumers to buy the product .another example would be diet coke .advertisement say that diet coke has less calories than the original one .if one has ever drank diet coke , she will notice that it is sweeter than the real one since diet coke use artificial sweetner .according to the research , artificial sweetner has no calorie but is more harmful than the real sugar if consumed in large quantities .nevertheless , the advertisement does not mention anything about those information .it is sel-evident that the advertisement gives the false impression .in conclusion , advertisements are not to be believed completely because they omit the bad effects or disadvantages of the products .consumers buy the products if they are attracted by the advertisements and that is producer s trick : representing the better quality of the product to allure the consumers .
