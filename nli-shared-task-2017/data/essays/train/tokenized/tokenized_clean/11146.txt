i disagree with this statement for two reasons .at first , it would be quite difficult for students to understand ideas or concepts , if they do not learn facts of them , or even let the students a misunderstand , to learn facts is not necessary .when a history teacher in high school teach students about a compared between industry socialty and agriculture socialty .both of the defnitions are easy to remmeber , but how to understand the difference ?acturlly students have kown the facts of industry by their living , even before the teacher explains the facts .they know that industry has producted our model lifes , from telephone to internet , from cars to jets .to try to understand , what does mean agricalture ?just let us live without all the facts of industry .however , to understand ideas and concepts is not the full task for students , and not even the goals to study from the beginning .as adults , we know it now , the right way to handle the knowledge is to use it .teachers should let the students know , good memorry about ideas and concepts is just helpful in some exams , but not in working and living .in china we have many negative examples , because schools were only concerntreting on teaching about exams in last 20 years .a famous emploryer complained that he did not dare to hire the people who achieved doctor degree in china .because they knew the concepts very well , but failed to use them in practical , and they did not know a good communication is the key in a team to use the concepts in facts .as i went to germany and began my college study in stuttgart .i knew in first time , most of things i had learned till my high school have only one goal , that is to use them in fact .i began a lot of courses to learn facts there , from communication to techique .that is the key .
