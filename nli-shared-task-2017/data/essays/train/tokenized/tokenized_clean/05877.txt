i do nt think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide because :first , the routes of the guided trips are general standarized .the visits and intineraries are already studied and planned by the tour guide so there is a chance you can miss an important site or place .i think the best way to make a trip is by buying guides published by a well know brand like lonely planet .this guides are full with tips , facts , history , hotels recommendations , restaurants , bars , etc .second , in most of the guided tours you will have limited free time since you need to follow a schedule .for example , after visiting a church or temple , a museum . ..you will only have 2 hours of free time .i believe that with this much of free time you can slightly see the city .in general , all the hotels that tour trips reserve includes breakfast and generally you will have to wake up early .what if i want to wake up late and have breakfast in a typical restaurants recommended by the locals ?by travelling in a group you relly on other people tastes .maybe one member asks the guide to visit a toy factory .what if i do nt want to go there ?other reason is that not all of the tour guides are well prepared .in my experienice with tour guides i had some good and some bad .ocassionally some tour guides even lie or just make up facts to make the tour more appealling .and finally , what if i do nt get along with somebody in the group ?or maybe he asks too many irrelevant questions that may delay the an activityi had travelled in both ways , in a tour group with a guide and with just my friends and a book as a guide .i find the second more enjoyable since you mark your own pace , intinerary , and the best of all , you choose the people to go with .
