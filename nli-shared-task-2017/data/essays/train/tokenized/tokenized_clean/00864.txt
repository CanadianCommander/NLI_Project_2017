yes , i totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder because there are too many advertisements present their products in the most attractive ways .i think the reason is that there are many companies and manufactures out there making the same type of products .therefore , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive .and due to the advanced technologies those advertisement agencies use , almost every product they present looks like the best on the market .but very often , consumers do nt really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ads .for example , few weeks ago i saw a digital camera ad on fry s electronics that was offering a great discount on this featuring model .it the picture , the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built .although i owned a professional digital slr camera ( by canon ) for a while , i wanted soemthing inexpensive , small , and easier to carry around in the campus .i purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store .when i took it home , i realized its body was not metal but some light ; cheap plastic .the fully charged battery died with in just 30-40 minutes of photo shooting after trying it .i finally got frustrated and decided to return it .the return line was very long and the guy behind me was returning the same camera too due to the same reason .we talked for more than 30 minutes while waiting and we reached a conclusion that never purchase something just based on the ad or picture .from now on , i do studies online or read some consumer reviews before i purchase .even the old saying goes `` a picture worths more than a thouthand words  , it does nt apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays .
