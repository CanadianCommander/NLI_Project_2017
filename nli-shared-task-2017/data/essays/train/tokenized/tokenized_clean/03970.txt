advertisements are a huge impact in today s society .they impact greatly on the decisions people make when choosing one thing over the other .they can make one person change their mind about a thought they were holding very strong or make that thought even more stronger .i agreee with the fact that advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are .when looking at an advertisement people look on how this add makes a product look , the color , the person on it , the letters , many things influence a persons perception on the product by just looking at the advertisement .if an advertisement is very colorful it might make a person thing oh this product is fun or it seems like very easy to use .if in contraty it is very simple , the person may look at the product as boring or very lame .also whoever is on the add can affect this , if we see a celebrity we might wanna use this product just so that we look as pretty as they dothe problem with very well designed advertisement is that the prodcut may not be as well designed .many pepople when they see an advertisement that calls their attention alot , tend to assume that the products works just as well as the add was put together , and in many cases this is not true .in my opinion i think advertisements make look product so much better that they really are .in my own experience i have encountered this problem .once before i wanted to change my brand of sahmpoo and as i was looking at a tv add and i saw a particular kind of shampoo that callled my attention a lot because in the add there was a calebrity displaying how her hair looked after using this shampoo .it callled my attention so much i thought my hair was going to look like that if i bought it .i bought the shampoo and i came to find out my hair became very oily on the roots and very dried at then ends , nothing like what it looked like on that particular celebrity .i was really dissapointed .i think that when purchasing a product that we want to be of great quality , adds should be the last part we focus on .we as potential buyers for any industry should focus more on personal experiences people have had with this product or just by doing some research .adds do not show the true quiality of a product all it does is make it more falshy so that people spend their money on it .
