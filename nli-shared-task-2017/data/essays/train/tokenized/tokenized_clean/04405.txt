some people may think that the current usage in cars is not sustainable from an environmental reason .however , i disagree to the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years time , based on increases in the world population and improvement in the quality of life among the developing countries .first , the population of the world is growing on a continuous basis , and it is not sensible to assume that number of cars will not grow at least in a linear manner , simply because car is necessary for transportaion .facing necessity , the environmental issues need to be dealt elsewhere , not by decreasing the number of cars , but by replacing the cars with environmentally friendly fuels .the current development in the area of batteries and solar energies seems promising .second , many third world and developing countires are growing rapidly .15 years ago , car was owned by limited number of people in china .today , roads in big cities like shanghai are congested with cars and you can barely move .buying cars is a current new trend in china among young people .they have become able to purchase cars because their income basis has improved .countries in the middle east and russia are following the same situation .going forward , countries from africa is expected to follow .people have a necessity to transport , and once you obtain a certain level in your quality of life , it is extremely difficult to lower them .i believe that the only possibility to have less cars in the future needs to come from a technological invention that replaces cars to other type of methods .however , twenty years is a relatively foreseebale future , and the fact that we are not aware of any invention leads me to believe that cars will keep on increasing in the future .therefore , i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .
