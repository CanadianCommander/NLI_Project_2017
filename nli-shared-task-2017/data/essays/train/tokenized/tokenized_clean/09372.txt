what i feel is it depends on the level of education we are in , for example if we r in a under graduate stage its better to learn about various academic subjectswhen we come to graduation stage its better to study the subject in which we want to specialize in futureat undergraduation stage its good to learn all academic subjects , we r never aware that how the others subjects influence us in future for example myself being an undergraduate student i was asked to choose different subjects and i had a choice to study both maths and sciences and when i came to graduation stage my subject was computer science and it is no were related to physics and maths but when i was given a paper for my nasa project , maths and sciences helped me a lot to slove arthematic problems related to problem sloving in programmable language and next physics made me to slove some climatic problemsthis had a big impact on my paper presentation because i could do it very quickly with out any errors and when a man reaches to a gradutate stage he should be specialized in only one subject because the course we do mainly deals with many practicalsmore over since it is the most crtical stage in our life because after tat we finally end up in any work , we dont continue our studies again so unless untill if we r not mastering in the subject which we need to do it , then we will end up in a confusion stageso what i strongly belive is when we reach graduation stage we need to work strongly on the subject we choose , tat leads us to work for a good company , its like jack of all arts and masters of none its a famous quote it says tat being jack in all arts is waste than mastering in one art this will strongly supports my statement when comes to students who r doing graduationso the people who r undergraduates can work on all subjects , but when its comes to the matter of graduation we need to master just one specialize subject .
