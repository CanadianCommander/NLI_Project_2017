a company has the possibility to make its product known through advertisement .commercials have proven to be efficient , even though we know that the different products available for the customers do nt have the same efficiency .but it is still a right to use advertisements .through this process you have to give a touch of your product in the best w possible way , and make the watcher beleive that it is the best product he or she could find .that s why most advertisement make products seem much better than they reall are .however , over time the best products persist .therefore the company offering the best products will make better profits , and then have enough money to advertise and to perfectionate their products .though , even if a comercial will make the products seem better , we know for a fact that this company works well and so that the products are one of the best .in another hand , the needs of the customers are not the same .so brands and product are subjectives .the one product that would be efficient for my personal opinion and requests will not be as good for you .finally , the process of unreal advertisements is part of the economy system .if we would know before buying any product that the x product is the best for us , we would only buy one .but we spent a lot of money to find the great one .the advertisement system is also an economical question .advertisement company make a lot of money .in both way the economy works better .in conlusion , most comercials make products seem much better than they really are , but using advertisement is a right .the products in the advertisement may meet your needs and criteria , but not mine .on top of that , the overall process is good for the economy of the world .
