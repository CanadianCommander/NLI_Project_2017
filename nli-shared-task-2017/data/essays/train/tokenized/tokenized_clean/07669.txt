in the modern capitalist life , marketing and image are becoming sort of equivalent things .the audio-visual media generate and move huge amounts of money , and what is more , in an exponential way .for example , let s think in the tv .on one hand , tv moves loads of money so enterprises want to invert in it the more and more .on the other hand tv produce and strange decreasing effect on people s critere and abilities to judge .so the more and more there is people who just belive in whatever they can see in a tv commercial , and what is more , if your favorite tv star is wearing this amazing product you always wanted to belong , then there is definitely no reason to doubt about the fact you have to buy that product .unfortunately , enterprises now that , so they invert in marketing .for this reason i absolutly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .but , what happen when the consumer realize the trick ?well in this case , what happen it is nothing .when consumers realized they have been trapped by the marketing technics , they just keep the product and go to buy another one in the way they thought the first product they bought was .i think it is untolerable that this kind of things can happen .the consumer associations apparently do nothing , and when some upset consumer try to denunce the situation it is just like if you talked to a wall .so in conclusion , from my point of view the goverment should make any intervention and should promote consumer associations to let them be more effective .on the other hand people should spent time in carrying out activities to develope their judgement skills , for instance reading books and not watching tv .unfortunately it seems that it is hard to happen .in my opinion , not only products seem much better that they really are ; it will be an incresing trend in this fact that will lead to the dicrease of the quality of products the more and more , and will make people spent money more frequently and major amounts of money each time .
