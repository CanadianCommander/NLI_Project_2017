although the car market is a harsh business as we can see from the crash of companies such as general motors or rover , i do not agree with the statement saying that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today for two main reasons .first , the developed countries that are today the first customers for cars are still developing new markets with electric cars or hybrid cars and the cars market is going really well .moreover , western countries populations are very attached to cars since they allow people to be independant and go wherever , whenever they feel like it .in some coutries you can not imagine how it would be without cars .in the united states for example , people would not be able to live properly since in most city you can not do anything without a car .and plublic transportation system are not efficeint enough to make citizens to abandon their cars for buses or subways .the second factor that makes it impossible for the numbers of cars to reduce in the next twenty years is already in motion .countries which used to be underdevelopped are now emerging and have a flourishing economy .these coutries , like china or india are generally overpopulated and as soon as these population reach a decent leaving standard they will get cars .this phenomenon is alreay happening in china where rods are being built everywhere and people getting cars .with a population of more than a billion person china will soon be the first customer for cars and also the first producer .it is impossible that the number of cars will be reduce in the next twnty years because there are many other countries like india or china that are just waiting for their turn to be developped .so basically it can not be said that there will be fewer car in use in twenty years since the market is doing good in western countries and that a whole new market id developping in the newly developped countries .
