having a broad knowledge of a vast range of academic subjects will prove to be effective if a person feels the urge to excell in various carreerpaths , or has a scholar position that demands a certain level of cultural backgroung and knowledge .this way , an individual may be able to cover a wide range of topics and portray himself as a consultant , who is capable of mentoring and advising in many areas .for instance , a lawyer who later specializes in human resources , and mass communication , could easily coach a company in organizational culture assesment , propose solutions or strategic plans through an effective communicative mechanism , handle employees benefits and compensation , and also deal with litigations or other legal related issues .as a team leader , he could also lead or intertwine different departments and monitor their activities due to the fact that he conveys many of the elements involved in one person .in addition , it gives you the opportunity to experience other positions or maybe switch jobs , having the reassuring feeling that if something goes wrong along the way , there are other options to consider because the knowledge is there .on the other hand , by specializing in one specific subject , a person can direct all efforts and skills to his field of interest , therefore becoming an expert in the area and turning out to be highly coveted for his expertise .in the case of a medical doctor who specializes in cardiology , he will probably dedicate all his life to this branch of the medical field , gain experience and offer a much deeper insight than a regular doctor would .both carrer moves are effective when they are aligned to the individual goals .if it is mandatory to take sides , and choose one path , i would definately , take the broad knowledge approach , it offers a multi disciplinary focus from a professional perspective which allows you to asses , advise , mentor , tutor and try different options in the job market .
