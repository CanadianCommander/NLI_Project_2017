it is commonly said that , even if you get old remain young at heart .this is because young enjoys every bit of life , when they are working , playing , partying or even when they are wasting their time .youth represents eneregy , flow , ability to work hard and party harder .therefore , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .at young age , people have dreams , aims , hopes and ability to fulfill their dream .this encourage them continously to work hard and acheive their goal .at young age , they enjoy this hard work .while older people do it for its sake .for them , it is routine and nothing inspiring is left in doing those thing .they are just cutting the time .at the time of party , youth enjoys it even harder , as it is the outcome of their hard work .they tend to flirt , dance , drive , eat and drink .this gives them an complete experience , which the old can never enjoy .being old , you can not flirt or dance , and limitations come on eating and drinking due to health problems .also , they are in continous tensions , for variety of reasons .this make their life boring .at young age , you have friends of various interests .this helps you to take part in each and every game .you can go for rock climbing , sea diving , underwater swimming , formula racing and even to various other sporting events .but as you grow old , your stamina decreases , you are sorrounded by various illness , energy level has decreased a lot .all this factors lead you to keep out of such sporting events .in my country , people are always thinking of other s view and opinion .this inhibits their desire to break all the rules and become young once again .wheras young do nt give a penny to such things .they enjoy life in full stretch .they do not care for other s opinion and do as they want , which is also a prerequisite of enjoyment .there is also othet part of coin .young people want to live life happily , without a break .so , if something unwanted happen , they get depressed very easily .at this stage , youth require experience of older people to fight this depression .if the young learn to avoid depression and understands thats up and downs are part of life they can easily come over any situation and enjoy life non stop .thus , it can be easily concluded that , if you want to enjoy life you have to become young again .it is not that older people do nt enjoy but when they enjoy we seldom says that they had return to their young age .this is enough to say that young people enjoy a lot .
