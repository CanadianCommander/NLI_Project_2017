media has become the fastest and most efficient way for advertising .with the availability of the technological means , any product may be advertised adjustly in order to meet each client s needs and expectations .some advertisements are even spread worldwide and translated to different languages to serve the audience .it is clearly undoubtful that each company always tries its best to present the product it wants to sell in the best way possible .not only because it is esential to promote the product , but also because its the company s right .however , what is not part of it s rights , is to lie about a product .most advertisements show their product to be the best one ever yet , and always shows that the product serves directly and perfectly its original purposes .the new trend is to have celebrities acting in the clip , attractive women , and special effects and backgrouds , and all of this is fine .its very pleasant to watch well done advertisements and its always delightful to hear that there s finally a product that will allow one not have wrinkles before the age of sixty ; however , its very disappointing when one actually tries it and doesnt get the expected results .the problem nowadays is that the competition is too high .of course with the presence of media and the availability of easy and fast means of transportation , a company finds itself competing not only on a local scale , but also internationally , and this could be and most definitely is a threat .by promoting the product properly , which usually results in making it seem way better than it really is , the company stands a chance in the market , and has a better opportunity to sell .of course these reasons do nt make it alright for advertisements to be a complete lie , because most of them really are , but this is how business works these days , and marketing or advertisement are increasingly being wanted and needed .
