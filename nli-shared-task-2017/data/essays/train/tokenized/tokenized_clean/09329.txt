it s 21th centry now , and if you visit to a developed country , you can see cars everywhere .cars have become an important part of our daily life , on weekdays we drive to work , at weekends we drive to tour .for myself , i do nt believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all , cars are too convenient .everyone wants to have a car if they could .and , as the technology improving , to producing a car become much more easier than before .what s more , they are even cheaper !in the past , you may found someone complaining about cars are too expensive .nowaday , you ll only hear that people could nt decide which one to buy !some families even have two or more cars , for each family members they have their own car .that s something you ca nt ever imagine before .the second reason i would like to talk about , is the developing country .take china for example , think about how many people are there in china .what will happen if everyone in china bought a car ?maybe it will be a super traffic jam , but it s something that could really happen .in the recent years , the developing country , such as china , india , and tailand , had grow repidly on their economy .what make it worse is that they are also the regions that have the most population around the world .combine the two factors , people and money , it will be a huge market for everything , and cars , of course .or maybe you could tell the 600 million people to take the bus ?well , that still need a lot of buses , and still increases the number of cars .i do know that cars have lots of bad affects on our environment , and i hope that the number of cars could decreases through the time .but , will that be happen ?i do nt think so .maybe we need more education on people about how the cars hurt the environment , so that the number of cars wo nt increase so fast .but to decrease ?i do nt think so .
