to know a few from everything , or know only one thing better than anything ?nowadays , most people know lots of things but they know it undetailed .i think knowing one thing , and knowing it detailed is better than knowing plenty of things undetailed .to start with , being an expert in one specific academic subject is better than being a newbie in plenty of academic subjects .this also makes a person think more knowledgeable .for example , imagine two people who graduated from same major in university , works in the same company and both in the same department .one of them knows only about his department but knows everything about it , and the other one knows a little about his department , and also knows about other departments .if their manager had to choose a person for a project about their department , he will choose the one who is knowing more things about the department .thus shows that being an expert in one specific subject is better than knowing plenty of subjects .furthermore , knowing too much thing disattracts people from their job or situation which makes them more unsuccessful .this also proved by many scientifical researches .the research shows that 4 out of 6 people disattract from the subject if they do not know the subject too much .it also a disadvantage for people for looking out for jobs and doing good things such as good projects , and works .there is also one more positive thing for specializing in one specific subject .people who have experty in one academic subject can make more process quickly and have more trust unlike the other people .with the advantage of knowing deeply an academic subject , they can make process quickly with a few mistakes , and also they would not lost their confidency while doing it .for example , a student who did specialize in one specific subject can make a better homework than a student who knew a few things about the subject .this situation proves that specializing in one specific subject is more better .to sum up , i can say that i totally agree with the opinion which states specializing in one specific subject is better .if there is more people who specialized in one specific subject , there will be more success all over the world .at last , we are all human , and we can not know everything perfectly , so we should do the best thing we can do , and be an expert about that subject .
