i partly agree with the statement that the use of cars will dicrease in twenty years .however , it can be thought that the thechnology of car will improved and more people would want to use .nowadays , we have so many public transportation and other kinds of vehicle besides cars .for example , my community recomands to use public transpotation rather than using own cars .the reason is that the many use of cars will cause global warming and air pollution .if people use public transportation together , it would help keeping air cleaner than using own cars .in addition , there are other vehicles bisides cars such as a air plain and fast train .the air pain was one of the suprising invention for himan beings .however , thesedays , we often use it , in fac , tmore than before .the cost of it got cheper than before and easier than before .therefore , many people have oppotunity to use air plain in even short trip .however , the car technology is being imploved everyday .the car company try to produce more useful and high ability cars .as global warming problem and air pollution problem are caused by the emittion of chemical elements from cars , the car company try to find new energy source such as h2 .moreover , many of system of car are improved for people to use so easy and convinient , it can be said that more people want to have cars .today , it is difficult to live without having car to .as long as the car is improved collect way and nice to the environmment , the car use is not dicrease but should be increase .
