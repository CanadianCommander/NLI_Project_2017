we do nt have the day that we do nt look at any advertisements in our daily life .there are so many advertisements such as tv commercials , plates or posters on the street , and so on .and now nobody would like to watch a boring and less interesting ad .it causes the market for advertisments severely and unfaithfully .in this situation , i agree that almost all of the advertisements help merchandise look better because the product companies have to and sell huge amount of goods and advertisement companies must make a wonderful ad to compete thier rivals .first of all , company has to sell its products and get profits as muh as possible , otherwise it might be bunkrupt in the future because of a small change .it is clear and crucial for any companies , so every companies tries to improve thier products even if it is only advertisement .in addition , there are severe competition between ad companies .it makes the company to produce good-looking commercials .now good and interesting view of product is very important for buyer to stop looking at them .hence , these company are trying to make better one than it really is .in conclusion , i strongly think merchandises must promote well .in my opinion , i also think this hard market produce a lot of lies .therefore , the position of costomer servise became extremely important part of the company in a dacade .
