i strongly disagree with the best way to travel with tour guide .when i was a kid , i went to sighting with my parents , relatives , and tour guide .it was the worst experience which i have ever had .here are several reasons why traveling led by guide is so bad .in begin with , traveling with guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start .it can not give you a free time .not only that , but you can not afford to break even though you can not buy only one present for your friends .i think that one of the purposes which have a tour is relax without busy life .if you go with guide , you will not get any fresh air .second , traveling in a group makes people angry .it can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested , others have a desire to move another places because they do not need to observe anymore .in this case , they have to decide what they will do .but any group in this situation would be disappointed .finally , there is a famous maxim - if you travel alone , you are not alone .it means that going trip alone allows you make frineds .for instance , i went to japan when i was a freshman in the university .i had a traveling for a month .i can not speak japanese fluently in that tour , i can make friends - nakasaki , murama , and yorisimo .it was an unfogettable experience .when you are with your fellows , you can not have chances to have new foreign friends .as i mentioned above , i do nt like traveling in a group led by guide .fixed tour planning makes me exhausetd .group tour makes persons dissatisfied .and if you can go somewhere alone , you can get friends .on the contrary , if you are very old , you can like a group tour with a guide .it makes sense that if you are satisfied with that , you are too old to feel free .
