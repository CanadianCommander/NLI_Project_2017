i am agree with this statement because the successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well .to support this idea i will use some simple examples and other simple reasons .for example i think that every professor of the most important universities in europe and united states are good ( it is a reasonable assumption for me !!! ) , clever and are able to do well their job , but only few of these can become famous in the world winning the nobel !who wins this , wins because his study or his research is revolutionary and very important .to be revolutionary you have to study something new and you have to take risks .another example is that many persons can play a musical instrument , but only very few people become famous and remembered in the history of music , thanks to their innovative style of their music .from this two simple examples it is easy to see that a lot of persons are able to do well something , but the successful persons study or create something innovative and just for this they take risks .many times the research of succes does not go well and you can lose time and other things , but for me , taking the risks , it is the price that you have to pay if you want to try to have succes .
