i do nt agree with the statemant .i do nt believe most advertisements make products better .one example of advertisemants is to happen in my couontry , japan .there is a pretty popular company of vinegaer .the vinegaer s color is black .it is said that it is better than normal one .actually , it is better , but the company said that black one contained many times nutirition .it was wrong .i ca nt believe avdvertisements .another example is when i was in japan .i sometimes brought something on the internet .i ca nt remember what i bought , but i just remember it that it was terrible .i decided to buy something when i saw a advertisement on the internet .it was said that we sold the product with the lowest price in japan .but , one of my friend already had same product , and he bought in tokyo with lower price than mine .i do nt believe advertisement since that .last example , in japan , we bought by advertisement , we could nt get better product that on advertisement .avdvertisements just show that how product is better .so , actually advertisements are not better than real product .i never believe it .
