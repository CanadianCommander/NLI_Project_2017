i disagree with the statement saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject .i will illustrate my views below .there is an english proverb which beautifully fits in the above case : `` a jack of all is a master of none .in the past scientific knowledge was relatively limited as compared to now .now many new fields have been developed and even in a single field there are many sub divisions .for e.g. computers .before there no sub-divisions in the field of computers but now we can broadly classify them as hardware , software , middle-ware , internet & networking , etc .even in these sub-divisions we can have several more options .the point i am trying to make here is that fields are more diverse and varied then they were before .hence it is simply not possible to excel in all of them and having only a general idea about them will not suffice .additionally knowledge has become more and more complex than before .having a general idea about things is not enough to perform the tasks adequately .for e.g. a cfo ( chief financial officer ) of a company has reasonable knowledge about law .so does it mean that he will be as competent as a lawyer specialising in these tasks ?alternatively a lawyer can not do adequate justice to the job of a cfo .let me illustrate my point further .would you like to live in a building which has been made by person having a `` general  idea of construction , architecture and engineering or would prefer living in a building made by a team of experts in their respective fields .focus on one topic inspires confidence not only in others but also in the person doing the job .hence with the points above i have best tried to justify my conclusion .
