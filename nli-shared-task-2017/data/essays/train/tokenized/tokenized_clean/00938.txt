the concept is the base of life .indeed , our world and our way of thinking are built on ideas or concepts .we often associate school as a place where pupils have to learn facts by heart .but where should we place the limit between a wisdom acquierd by learning the facts and a knowledge based on concepts ?a history class would be the best example to answer this question .indeed , while pupils are studying a certain period of history , the most important for them is to understand the way of thinking of the people living at that time , their ideas , the circumpstances , what happened before , the consequences i.e. , the whole context .however , i think that it is also very important for them to be able to structure every thing .therefore students should have to learn precise dates and events in order to illustrate by concreat examples their ideas .the concept is the first thing that we should learn , because it is what we keep in mind after a lesson .but if this concept is not associated to a date or illustrated by a fact , the concept does not worth anything anylonger .on top of that , how could we explain a concept without giving any example ?it s just impossible .phylosophy , which is the science of concepts is based on example and thus on facts .this leads me to say that it is really important for a student to have a good memory and that is why children have to learn poems by heart .as far as i am concerned , ideas and facts are deeply linked .we could even go further by saying that very often we start by learning the fact and then we understand the idea which is behind this fact .in mathematics for example we learn the formules of the sinus and the cosinus before even knowing what they represent .it follows then that even if ideas are more important when we take a step back , we do not understand them right away without any facts or dates .to sum up i would say that after having learnt and understood something , the idea is more important , but while learing this particular thing , we can not separate the idea and the fact .
