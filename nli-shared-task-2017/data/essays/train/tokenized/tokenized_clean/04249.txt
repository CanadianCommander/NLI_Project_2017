i completely agree with the statement because what i personally believe is that in order to succeed , one has to keep on trying new things , explore the maximum one can in his/her domain and take measured risks .doing what one already knows certainly does not make the person successfull at all .if a person keeps on doing what he or she already knows , a time comes when that person becomes bored and frustrated and calls for a change .moreover if he or she gets used to it , then they might have problems in migration .exploring new avenues is really the best way to succeed as this is the only way a person can compare the statistics of what he or she is doing over times with what has been done now .furthurmore , trying out new things helps in building up things and keeping the spirits and energy levels high as at each moment you are watching something new happening at your end .would like to mention about late kalpana chawla , an artronaut , who used to work with nasa .she is an inspiration for the people who want to succeed in life .she was one of the crew members onboard columbia which crashed a couple of years back .the crew was supposed to perform 38 predetermined experiments , kalpana was the only one onboared who took the initiative of performing some more research in biologocal environment , genetics , etc. and even after her death her work has been appreaciated .bill gates , i m sure that everyone knows him .he had a tendency to try out new things what others might not even think of .his business involved so much of risk that a couple of big failures might have led him nowhere .but still he kept going and today according to me he is the most successful person just because he tried out new things in his life and also he is probably the person who has had an enormous risk taking capacity .even if you fail while taking risks , you still would learn something new that would help you in developing an instinct that wouls be very helpful for you to be on the top of the world .just keep your spirits high .
