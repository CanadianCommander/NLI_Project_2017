it would be beautiful to believe that twenty years from now fewer cars would be circulating on our streets ; but the sad truth seems to be that , in that period of time , many more vehicles will fill our streets and contribute to polluting our world .on one hand , it is true that technology is rapidly evolving and that what today is `` brand new  , tomorrow will be completely obsolete .the perfect example of this is computers .pcs become obsolete almost as soon as they are finished .the same thing applies to cars .it could be that the great love that many have for cars today , died tomorrow due to a guilty conscience or environmental awareness .people could start using other means of transportation that pollute less .or the automotive industry could create a new way of collective transport that would lead to less cars on the streets .on the other hand , it is difficult , in a such globalized environment , to believe that the main mean of transportation : the car , will , in such little time as twenty years , be less used .the fact of the matter is that cars are all around the world .everybody needs one to go everywhere .even young adults try to prove who they really are to others thanks to the car they own .in new york , for example , not everybody owns a car , but taxis are available for those who need them which is , basically , the same thing .how does someone from a small town go to work in a big city ?by car , even when there are buses or trains available .one could walk or go by bicycle to many places in his or her town : groccery store , post office , etc. , but many still prefer driving .we have to face the truth .i disagree completely with the statement because i do not believe that our world is moving in that direction .we are still not aware of the great stress cars are causing on the environment and i do not think that we will be in twenty years .it is not that i am not hopeful , i am , and i really hope that i am wrong in not believing in humans , it is just that i look out into our lives and i see what is there , not what i wish to see .
