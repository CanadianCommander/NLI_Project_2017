teachers are constantly asking themselves whether it is more important that their students should understand abstract concepts rather than learning facts .these two thesises were in fact respectfully defended by montaigne and rabelais : the first believed in a well made mind whereas the latter a filled mind , for surely it is better that a student goes out in society and in the world knowing by heart facts in their head rather than having an empty mind .yet , i believe that it is preferable to have a well made mind that are open enough to understand concepts and that montaigne praised so much about .most parents , however , believe that their children should go to school to learn mathematics , know the dates of historic battles , know that names of famous writers so that the children would sound highly accomplished as they would be able to show off their knowledge , which as erasmus stated is `` power  .this would generally imply that the objectives of going to school would be to gather facts .yet what would be the use of accumulating them if the students do not grasp the meaning ?thus , instead of being supercilious , they would make fools out of themselves and would be dismissed as false machines , in other terms useless to the world .indeed , what is then the use of having such portable dictionnairies when one would usually be in possession of such books in their reach ?furthermore , with the frequent use of the internet , various information that we did not learn and that are needed could be found in a matter of a minute .thus , it is not required for a person to recite facts especially that his or her memory could not be entirely depended upon .what the world needs which neither a dictionnary nor any machine could provide is the use of one s intelligence to ensure that he or she takes the most righteous or practical actions or decisions .such a capacity could be provided with a well made mind and also with an experienced one .of course , it is important to have some knowledge and learn ideas and concepts to forge one s way of reflecting and to gradually allow them to take their own personal minds up but this could not be done unless they have a well made mind .this education for a well made mind would allow them to understand new ideas and concepts and fully grasp them .therefore , it can be said that is it more important for the students to generally have the capacity to understand ideas rather than learning facts .
