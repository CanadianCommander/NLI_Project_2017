i believe that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .understanding ideas and concepts can lead to interesting debates , it can be used in our everyday life and it can also help us understanding different facts from the past .facts are only dates and names in books or newspapers , while concepts and ideas let us imagine different possibilities through different aspects of life .first of all , understanding ideas and concepts can lead a classroom or a group of friends into an interesting debate .by exchanging opinions about a particular concept , for example , communism , we can learn new things and support our opinion by giving arguments .understanding the ideas of our mates is also important .it gives us a chance to be in the other person s position .it helps us to have a wider frame of mind .secondly , being educated about many concepts and ideas can help us in our everyday life by helping us taking an important decision .for example , if you have to vote at a provincial election , you need to understand what thesis each candidate supports .you need to be aware of the consequence that each political party can bring to the population .you can develop your own opinion based on ideas and concepts , and then make a choice about the party that will get your vote .lastly , the capability to understand concepts can help you understand different facts that happened in the past .for example , if you understand the concept of socialism in the u.s.s.r. , you will be able to understand the actual facts about russia , such as economical difficulties , health problems and the gap between rich and poor people .in conclusion , i think that understanding ideas and concepts makes a student much richer than by simply learning facts .facts can always be learned in books , while concepts and ideas can mostly be learned through experience !
