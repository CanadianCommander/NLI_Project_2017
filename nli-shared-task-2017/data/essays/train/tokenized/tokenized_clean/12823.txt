it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subjects our days .i think that because today , no matter what you do you never know for how long you will still be doing to do that .everything can change in just a month today .if you look back 100 years ago , thinks were differnent , people only learned one job and kept on doing that job for their whole life .back than people mostly even passed on that job to their kids but today it is a lot different .people are not that much devided into classes anymore which gives everyone an oppertunity to do what they want .of course it is harder for a person who grows up in a bad neighberhood to become a lets say a proffesor but society and the law would allow him to do so .i am writing this from a western european point of view , i guess there are countries that might not have this freedom jet .in europe or in any developed country the competion for a working place is increasing , that is why i think it can only be helpful to know as much as possible , to be able to compete with others that are capable of doing the same work .in countries like france or germany it is getting really important to be well educated because if one is not educated it can happen that he would have a hard time getting a job because since the borders are opened , european union workers can come from every where and work for less money .for myself it is important to catch as much knowledge as i could possibly get .that is also one of the reasons why i am sitting here writing this essay .i guess people could argue that if one knows something very well he will always find a job but unfortunetly there is no safe job anymore .i just resently red that even jurnalism is not a safe job anymore because of all the internet pages where everyone can submit his experiences .
