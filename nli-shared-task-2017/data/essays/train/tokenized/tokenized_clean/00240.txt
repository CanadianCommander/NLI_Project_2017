in my point of view i completely disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .in my country , everyone enjoys life as much as possible and for them they do not care about their age .for them age is just a number ; they think that the spirit that is within themselves is what matters .so they enjoy their lives to its maximum in any period of time .and so , do i .besides , everyone has many goals , and one of them is to enjoy life .so no matter what age you are you can enjoy life .for instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friends , now let s see a old person having a vacation on the bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she loves .in my point of view , both people , the child and the old person are enjoying life , and i do not see why would one of them enjoy life more than the other .as i said before everyone has a spirit and i personally do not think that the spirit get older as the days pass by .within one s spirit there is energy .energy is what takes us from one place to another ; to eat or not to eat ; to do things or not to things ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life .so then , if everyone has a spirit that means that they also have energy , therefore everyone has an equal amount of energy to enjoy life at any period of time .to put in other words , age does not matter for someone to enjoy life .in conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same .it is true that when you get older the muscles start to be more flexible and solf and tends to break more easily than if you were young .but muscles do not have anything to do with enjoying life .it is also true that as you get older , your brains develops in different steps and so you can think more deeply about things that interest or bother you .but does that affect whether you enjoy life more than others ? .well , in my opinion my answer would be no .
