there are many reasons that make me think that the number of cars would be reduce in twenty years , for example the improvement in the public transport , the increase of the comunications like telephone and internet that could reduce the utility of a car because we could work from home , the increase in the contamination and therefore the policies of the goverments , and also the increase of the prices of petrol and gas .but i do not think that there will be fewer cars than today .during the last fifteen years we have seen a big improvement in public transports but it has not reduced the number of cars , as everybody can see there is more traffic , more cars per house , so the experience says that better public transport does not mean less cars , at least until now .obviously the price of the petrol and gas will be a problem , but since many years ago there has been research for new kinds of sources .now we have not discovered any better source than petrol , but is more than possible that we can find solutions in electricity and nuclear fields than can satisfied our needs , and with a good price .other reasons that make me think that the number of cars will not decrease but increase is our style of life .in a rich country like ireland we can see how is important the appearence , and in this country where the roads are not good , you can see big and expensive cars and people do not need them , why they have it ?only because when you have a big car , people respect you more because you look more important .another reason is the independence that i have with a car .i can go wherever i want for my own , and this point is very important for me and i think that for everybody , and is something that the public transport can not give us .
