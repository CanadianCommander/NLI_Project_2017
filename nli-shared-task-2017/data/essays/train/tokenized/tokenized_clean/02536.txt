whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is an interesting question .some people think it is better to specialize in ones , others think is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i think both are important , because it is important to have a complete but also specific preparation today .personally , i believe that the best thing it is to have a general preparation , infact i think it is important to have a broad knowledge , who can allow you to know a lot of things and to be preparate about all arguments than you are specialized only in ones .for example , when you are still student , you are not able to choose your specific interest , becouse you do not know all about the subjects .at school you can attend many courses , you have the opportunity to discover a lot of subjects and you are able to make your right choice .however , i think , after have a broad knowledge , it is an intelligent thing to specialize yourself in one argumentat .the subject can be the one you love more or the subject that you need for your work .i think , for example , at the university you can specialize yourself in one specific subject , and you can begin more practise in this and you can increase your knowledge .in conclusion , i believe , it is important to have a complete preparation , becouse olny this allow you to have a good work but it is important for your personally preparation .
