in my view it is not true that young people do nt dedicate enough of their spare time to helping in their communities .in the contrary , i see a lot of young people supporting local projects to help the older , the poor or to help children to grow up und thrive in a more healthy and heartfelt environment .i experience that a lot of help is given through the local church organisations .they run a variety of projects - from helping kids to do their homework in the afternoons to supporting the poor by handing out daily portions of freshly cooked food .most of the work done by the church organisations could not be achieved without the help of young people .although the young nowadays seem to have so many different options to spend their spare time , if you take a closer look , it is not so different as it was in former times .sports , friends and other cultural activities may consume now as they have always consumed a part of the spare time .but just as in former days some of the spare time is dedicated to help others in need .i am aware of the fact that not all the young people suppport their communities and that some projects may need more help from the youth .but overall one can not say , the young do nt dedicate enough time to support worthy causes .the dedication of young people to community work may be less visible now then it was in former times .mass media tend to overestimate other news .they usually do nt concentrate on the small differences the dedication to a church group , for example , makes .the help of the young may be largely unvisible to a larger community .nevertheless it makes all the difference for the people that experience the help - just as it has always been .
