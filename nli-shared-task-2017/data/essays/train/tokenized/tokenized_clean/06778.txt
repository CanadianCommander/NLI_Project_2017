i am of the opinion that it is hard to say if in twenty years will be more cars in use than today or not .today a lot of people - almost everyone - in germany have a car or even more than one car .a car symbolizes someone s status nowadays which is pretty said .i think that there are too many cars on the street because of the pollution and damaging the enviornment .why ca nt people walk or drive by bike ?why ca nt they even use the train ?people get lazy .but i presume that the tickets for a train cost too much also .it is said that germans have no money but it is possible for them to buy a car . ? !where is the point ?i think there is no point .but i really like that trucks are not permitted to drive sundays a coulpe of hours because the noise is gone .in twenty years peolpe are probably even lazier than they are today because everything becomes automatically and robots are going to be a normal use .so i actually do not think that there will be fewer cars in 2026 .on the other side it is possible that there will be fewer cars because people get poorer .everything becomes more expensive nowadays and people get less money .cars will be more expensive in a couple of years , too , and of course the gas .the gas is one of the major problems .it gets too expensive and people can not effort buying it anymore .and maybe there will be a law which says that people are not allowed to drive a car in a certain time period of the day and then people do not need a car .as a conculsion i would like to mention that it is very hard to say wheather there will be fewer cars in 2026 or not .people change and time changes , too .you never really know what will happen in the future .everything happens for a reason .
