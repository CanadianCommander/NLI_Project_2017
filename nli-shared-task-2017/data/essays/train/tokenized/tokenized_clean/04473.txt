i disagree with the statement , that is , i insist that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today .i have two reasons .one is about the continuous constructions of roads , and the another is about the conviniences of using cars .the first reason for me to disagree with the statement is that the construction of the road for cars are continuous .it will make the benefits by using cars widen more and more .although of course i agree that the construction of roads are often connected with the intents of politicians who are eager to earn money by producing too many roads , and it often said to lead to the damages to environment , these constructions can not help continuing without the dramatical change of laws that restrict these behaviors of politicians , which i think will not occur in twenty years .the second reason for me to disagree with the satatement is the convinience that cars bring us .by cars , we can go exact place where we want to go to , while for example trains can only brings us to the `` station ,  which might be very away from the place we want to get to .as shown in the fact that roads are so widely spread in the world , we are so benefited by cars that we ca nt stop using cars .so , it is easy to see that claiming bad effects cars have , such as polluting air , even though these effects are important enough to carefully think about , wo nt be able to stop us using cars in twenty years as we are nt now .for these two reasons , i disagree with the statement and insist that the numbers of cars will rather increase in twenty years .
