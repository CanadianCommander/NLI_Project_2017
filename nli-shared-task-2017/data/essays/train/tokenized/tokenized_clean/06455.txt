i do nt agree with this statement about the decrease in the use of cars in a twenty year period .maybe a different concept in his use would be possible due to new energetic sources or changes in people s way of life , but i m sure that cars are going to be as needful as today .it is true that town halls in big cities are trying to convince their citizens about how harmful to the enviroment is everyday massive traffic .their politics are now trying to be more aware of this problem , but i do nt think they really know how to solve it .they have built lanes for cyclists but , at least in madrid , using them is really dangerous due to the urbanistic structure .another reason why i think that car s users wo nt be reduced in the future is the way that big cities expand .people normally live in the outskirts of the city and they need to go downtown to work .how can they go to their jobs ?they can use public transportation but that s not a comfortable solution for them .they could spend double of the time going that way than going by car .even if people concern about the pollution problem and they start using public trasnportation or their bikes , they will always need a car in case they want to travel to other city or visiting a relative living in the other side of the town .i m talking about what is more comfortable and useful for them .this is why i think that reducing the number of cars wo nt be possible in such a short period .alternative energies like hydrogen or solar , should be more investigated in order to use them in car engines .this cars would nt harm the atmosphere and people could use their cars without feeling guilty .
