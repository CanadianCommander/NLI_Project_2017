i fully agree with the statement , because it s just what i ve always done in my life , every time i had to learn a new thing .i always try to focus on concepts and not on facts , so i can understand the reason why something happens and not simply how or when it happens .in this way it s much easier for me to remember the huge number of things i need to remember for my studies or even for my job .i think that this way of learning lets you remember things for the rest of your life , because once you learn how to ride a bycicle , you can not forget it anymore .even if you do not use it for many years , your brains can still remember how to ride it .maybe you need some minutes to revive your technique , but after only five minutes , you are able to ride it again as many years before .in the same way , you can learn theoretical concepts , like long and appearently complicated formulas , just trying to understand what is behind them and how to re-create them from scratch , starting from the concept that they represent .instead , if you just concentrate on facts , like sequences of events , dates or other `` useless  information , you may be able to remember them for a certain period of time , but definitely not as long as you live .actually there may be important facts to remember , but this is not the point .in a few words , i would say that the most important question we have to ask ourselves as students is `` why ?.
