i agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of my experience .first , understanding ideas and comcepts gives me more deep thinking than learning facts .if we check a dictionary , search internet , we can easily find a fact .although it takes a long time to understand ideas and comcepts , they raise my thought .it contributes our thinking .it is good chance to understand ideas and concepts for students .as students , we need to train our brain to understand ideas and concepts .second , understanding ideas and concepts give me interest .one day , i heard the fact that the time length of all compact disks is about 80 minutes .i wondered why the length is decided after i heard the fact immediately .i always need reason .therefore , i tied to look for the idea and i found .the reason was interesting that the longest popular classic music is about 80 minutes .i was excited to know the idea after i learned the factor .third , i am not satisfied to learn only fact .it is natural for me to attempt to understand ideas and concept .if i only learned facts , i do not feel that i learned something at all .i always like to know something .however , i think that it is useful to know only facts .i can not explain what i know without ideas and concepts in addition to facts .i need enough information what i know .even though i know just facts , it lacks my knowledge .in conclusion , i agree with the importance of understanding ideas and cencepts tha learning facts for students because of raising students  deep thinkng , stimulating interest , and satisfaction .
