i whole heartedly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisements are the source for the companies to reach the customers and sell their product .advertisements play an important role in forming an opinion about any product .if the advertisement is convincing enough , the customer will go and enquire about the product or will try the product .so , to leave a mark on the customer s mind , the advertisement is made very catchy and most of the times the advertisements become very misleading .the products are advertised to have so many features but when you actually see the product or use it , you come to know the real features .when you see an advertisement , you tend to get fascinated by the features mentioned in the advertisement but when you actually see the product , it leads to disappointment .but the advertisement actually help the company to bring customers to their products . ..for example , i read in a newspaper about a life time free credit card from a leading bank and i actually signed all the documents to get one .i got my credit card but later i came to know that some money was deducted from my account as the charges for a magazine subscription .when i asked the officer of the bank , he said it comes as a package with the card .that instance drove me to frustration .another instance is when i bought a shirt of a top brand .the company advertise the shirt as wrinkle free but when i actually washed the shirt , it was just a normal shrt with lots of wrinkles on it .instances like these happened many times .advertisements are mostly misleading but these at least help to bring customer to the shop or to sell the product .advertisement is a way by which the companies can reach the customers , tell the customers about the products and finally make their market .so , the advertisements should tell only the real and true qualities of the product .the misleading advertisements have led to the decline in the number of people watch or pay attention to the advertisements .in this way , the advertisements will lose their charm and importance soon .
