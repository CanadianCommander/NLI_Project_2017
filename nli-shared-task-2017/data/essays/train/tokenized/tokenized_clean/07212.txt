when we speak of academic generalizatiaon versus specialization i will disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .what differenciates a man from an animal .its his ability to think and analyse .its his mind that differenciates him .simailarly what differenciates a student who has done a general mba from one who has specialised in financial engineering .the answer lies in the fact that specific problems require specific solutions .very often in our work environment we are faced with peculiar problems which we are unable to solve .what do we do ?we call in the experts .an expert is one who specialises in solving a particular problem .he has the knowledge and the experience in that particular field that gives him the competitive advantage that the layman would not possess .let me explain this with a simple illustration .a export house that is expecting certain cash flows in the future is unsure of the currency market and would like to cover his future cash flows .a friend of his suggests that the best solution would be to book a forward contract and crystalise the amount of inflows .however what he doesnt realise is that if the market were to move favorably he would end up missing out on a lot of potential gains .thats why it would make more sense to be guided by a financial engineer ( the expert ) who would be able to structure a deal for him whereby he would minimise his risk while at the same time have acesss to higher returns .another classic example would be in the area of medical science .in a very simple case of tooth ache i would prefer to see the dentist rather than a general physician because i know that the dentist will be able to accurately pinpoint the problem and confidently give me a solution for the same .experts/specialists are often those people who will give you that edge over the competition .this is not to say that i totally disregard people who who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , its just that specialists are those who help differenciate the the best from the rest of the pack .in conclusion i would like to say that specialization adds that indepth understanding and analysis to learning the helps professionals to effectively counter problems in their specific field of study .
