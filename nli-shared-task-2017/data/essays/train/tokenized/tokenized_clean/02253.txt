i agree with this statement .young man nowadays tend to do only their private things , including playing sports , or studying .i feel that they should give more time to helping their communities .this practice will lead more people to be related with their communities .in these days , the relationships between individual and communities , from fammilies to the city or the town where they live , become lesser and lesser .this situation might lead some problems , such as , the collapse of the fammilies and the increase of the crimes .for example , in these ten years , we saw a lot of dangerous crimes which were occured by childrens were happened quite frequently .for example , about seven years ago , some fourteen years old boy killed seven people included five-year old girl , in japan .not only the case of japan , in the united states , a boy who had a gun occupied the school and some students were injured .this kinds of serious crimes are happened all over the world .i think we should change this situation , which people are isolated indivudually against their community , and that will prevent young people s crimes .so i will reccomend two resolutions to resolve the problem .first , we should make young people to help their communities through their school life .for example , we will make some agreement that school boys and girls should go to some places as volunteers .through this experience , they will know they have a responsibilities to their communities , and even though they are still young , they could help other person .secondly the adult people should lead young people as a model .infact , in these days even adults do not help their communities , so before they will say to the young people , they should refine themselves .however , some people might argue that today s young people does not have enough time to spend for their communities , because they are too busy for their private matters .like in japan , children should study hard to get into the good universtiy , and get the good jobs , so they usually go to the private school , in addition to the normal schools .this kind of situation will make them difficult to help their communities .so to this problem , i want to say that we , adults , should change our social structure and this school-oriented society .i can understand the problem which the young people have , but i hope they will change their attiude and we , adults and young people , will live peacefully in the future .
