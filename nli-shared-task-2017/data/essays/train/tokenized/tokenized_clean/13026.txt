we all know the common advertisements in the media .no matter if they appear in television , in magazines or in the radio .do hamburgers really look so much bigger and so much more delicious in the tv ?in my opinion , they definately do .in the different marketing lessons i took part in , i ve learned that this effect is a widespread marketing tool to sell more products and according to this a bigger profit .the marketing bureaus of big companies are working hand in hand with designers to make their product looking the best it is able to .let us have a little review about the example with the burgers .in the advertisements the burgers and french fries look so incredibly delicious that you might have a bite directly from your tv .furthermore they even seem to be very huge .but when you step in an fast food restaurant you will face the truth .the burgers taste awful and in addition to that you will , still hungry , leave the restaurant unsatisfied .there are plenty more examples than only the look of a product .for instance , most people think that the cars of daimler chrysler settle the leadership in safety .by using the only good results out of some safety tests , daimlers marketing bureau implements the reliability of their cars .but the real leader , when it comes to safety , is toyota .so , when the first problems with your air-bags occure , you might recognize the truth .the quality of some clothes gives us another example .regarding the very popular clothes company h & m , you know what their type of advertising is !in their ads they tell you that you get their clothes which so trendy and fashionable for an extremely low price .but you might get to know why this piece of fashion is so cheap when you put it the first time out of your washing machine .the colours have been bleached and they wo nt fit anymore .to sum up , i really have the opinion that the most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .
