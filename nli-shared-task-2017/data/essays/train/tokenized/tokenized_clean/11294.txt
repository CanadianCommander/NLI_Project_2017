i disagree with the statement .because i think that , do something we are known is more easlier to handle .successful people have done something that he good at , and this thing make him successful .use disney for example .every years , they will have new cartoons to show us .many people all over the world must watch them .becaus disney is good at creative cartoons .these cartoon make disney famous , successful and wonderful .disney also has their own disneyland .it is a famous story that everyone knows .however , if disney try to do something they have nt done before , such as they going to have a fashion store to selling some high fashion clothes .i think it may be not working .becaus they are not good at creative fashion things , they ca nt use the same ways to creative fashion from creative cartoon .may be they can success at the end .but i have no idea about the date they can do it .before they are success in the fashion ares , they must lose many time and money .people can not know about why disney want to creative fashion .because all people just know their cartoon is fantastic .no one will belive that they can do it at the beganning .people will have some brands of fashion to buy clothes .becaus these brands are good at fashion .they will not try to creative cartoon .so , i think wherever sucessful people or noraml people .they just want to do their best thing of what they good at .
