nowadays young people do nt spend their time to help their communities .in my opinion young people should be more involved in their communities .young people should deal with the problems of their communities .nevertheless , young people have to deal with many problems related to their life .as a consequence , they do nt have time to help their communities .in one hand , i believe that young people should try to eliminate the negative aspects of their society .in the other hand , i think that the communities must understand the young people problem s and try to solve them .young people have a lot of problems during their life .in particular , they have social problems .for example , they have difficulties to have relationships and they are not able to related wiht the society .as a result they prefer to stay alone .furthermore , in many cases young people during their study must find absolutely a job .young people after the work they want to spend their time wiht theis friends or families .moreover sometimes young people disagree with the decisions taken by their communities .as a consequence they dont  want to help them .in conclusion , i believe that today the young people do nt help their communities .nevertheless , i believe that communities must find solution to push young people to help them to solve problems .
