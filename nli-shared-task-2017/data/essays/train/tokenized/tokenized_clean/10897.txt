i think that it depends on what is the field of the academic subjects you are studying .if the acadmic subjects is about science or other similar subjects which need some professional knowledge , that will need to specialize in the specific subject .if the academic subjects is about education , bussiness or other similar subjects , that will need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in my concentration , education , i think i need the broad knowledge of academic subjects .to have broad knowledge of a lot of subjects is very important in studying education .teaching has a lot of works to do .if you want to make the learner understand what you are talking about , you will need to explain .but if you know less , how can you make your learner understand what you want to talk about ?the only way to solve the problem is to try to explain in many different ways untill your learner can know what you are talking about .that is why you need to have broad knowledge .because when you know more , you can teach more and you can make more people understand what you want to talk about .in other hand , if your subject is in those subjects which needs professional knowledge , it is better to speclialize in one specific subject .take science as an example : if you are studying the molecular biology , you needs many professional knowledge about biochemistry or molecular biology .if you can know more , you will study more .that will need more specific knowledge to make you learn more .that is the reason you need to keep on studying specific knowledge .to get the conclusion , my opinion of this topic is that it depends on what kind of subject you are studying .if the subject you are studying needs to explain or combine other knowledge , you will need to learn more from other subjects .but if your subject needs the professional knowledge , you would better to keep on studying more in your specific knowledge .that is the only way to help to learn more and better .
