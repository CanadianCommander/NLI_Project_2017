i agree with this statement .in my opinion , if you want to be successful in your live , you have to take some risks on several moments .for example , people who only do things that they know it always go well usually do nt settle for changing their job .because of that , they can lose a magnifical ocassion for getting a best job and also for earning more money .on the other hand , on numerous ocassions successful people start new bussiness although they are not sure they will go well .but , they do nt bother doing that because they usually are very positive people .even things do nt go too well , this kind of people can see the positive side of things .in contrast , taking too risks have also some drawbacks .before taking an important decission we have to think slowly about all things and risks it has .we must be very careful with our money and with the people who love and do nt take risk with them .if we always take decissions quickly perhaps some day we will have problems .
