sucess is an equivalent of taking risks .trying new things are an equivalent of being brave and facing new challenges .i agree that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than staying on their `` comfort zone  .a realistic example is my personal experience .i was born and raised in puerto rico .i completed my highschool and undergraduate college degrees in puerto rico .in my country , most rich young people attend to american schools and this enables them to be fluent in both language , english and spanish .even though that i come from a middle high class family and did nt have the luck of attending to an american school .i learned english watching television and reading english magazines .in addition that i attended to an intensive english summer program .in my junior year of college , i decided to apply for an exchange program at new york university and never thought that i was going to get accepted .so it happened , i did nt get accepted for the spring semester and was devasted .i felt like a looser .in the next upcoming fall semester , i decided to apply again and finally got accepted .just imagine coming from a very small island and having to compete with other us native studends .i got very scared but never looked back .i finished my exchange program with a 3.0 at one the toughest business school in the entire united states .that is a true example of success .i decided to try something new and take the risk of moving into a such difficult and fast lane city as new york city .even if at the begining things do nt work out the way that you wanted .just the fact that you tried that defines success .now a days , after all the struggle i am working at an advertising agency as an account executive and have an amazing appartment in one of the most exclusive neighborhood of the city .although the path was not easy and pleasant at the end i found success .
