young people enjoy life more than older people do .being a young person and comparing my self to my grandparents , i have some reasons to support that idea .first of all , younger people do nt face that many difficulties from the beginning of their life .as the time passes by , we learn the life and we face difficulties , sadness , heartbreaks and so on .and this can steal a lot from someone s energy for living .secondly just because young people have more time to live ( in normal conditions ) , they have more time to make their dreams come true .so they do nt stop expecting and this makes them better enjoy the life .but for example my grand father who s already 83 years old , do nt have any expactation .he thinks that he will die soon , he lost his power and will for life .also , if not married , young people do nt have as many responsabilities as they would have when they get married .they do nt need to think of their children .when they want to do someting , for example travelling , they do nt need to think if they need to take care of someone who s staying home .but for example for my parents it is never easy to do immediately what they want to do .they think of me and my brother , they think if we need them they can not be on our side and this makes feel them bad .also my father has big responsabilities of his work , he ca nt quit whenever he wants to .finally , it is also very common that older people have more health problems .as they get older , they are coming closer to the end of life and this gives them bad feeelings and keeps them away from enjoying the life .in conclusion , i would say that even if i will get older , i never want to stop enjoying life .if i m retired and in good financial situation , i can travel to see the world , i can keep expacting for my children or even grand children and if i have the power , i would spend my energy for the charity foundations .i believe making other people happy and providing them a better life would always make me enjoying the time i m living .
