there has been an argument regarding the issue that the best way to travel is a tour in a group generated by using tour agencies .some people maintain that it is very beneficial to travel because it is cheaper and safer than traveling alone .however , i believe that traveling in a group is not effective way to appreciate foreign cultures .in this essay , i will present two reasons for my idea .first of all , traveling with group members impose restrict regulations to tourists .in general , each person has their own personal preference .people usually set priorities on different issues .to contend these various demands , schedules should be set by their own .however , tour guides can not provide flexible regulations to people .this is because all of the schedules and regulations set by tour guides are focused to group people .for example , when i traveled in paris by using a group tour , i had really wanted to go to montrematre , famous streets in paris .however , tour agency stronly opposed to my idea because there is dangerous place to foriegn tourists .in addition , no other person did not join to my plan , so i finally gave up to visit there .seconly , touring in groups can not provide wonderful memories to people .generally speaking , one of the most important reasons that spring to people s minds in relation to travel is enjoyable memory .if the person go to seesighting alone , it is common knowledge that visiting strange places has high possibilities to face accidents .however , people are dare to want to face that sudden accidents , and a result these happenings will be enjoyable memories .however , if people travel in a group , they will lose a lot of chances to their own memories .this is due to the fact that almost every tours conducted by tour guides offer limited and regulated schedules .a study conducted by the department of korean tour associations shows that seventy percent of korean young people who once traveled in a group by travel agency answered that they did not satisfied with group travels .taking all i mentioned into consideration , i believe that touring in a group by a tour guide is a not best option .this is because it offers restrict shedule and , can not meet people s diverse tastes .
