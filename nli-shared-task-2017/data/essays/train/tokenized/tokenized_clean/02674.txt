i do believe that it is not about agree or disagree .i do believe that it depends on the people themselves .there are two kinds of people and let us listen to there opinion .first group say that it is a good idea to be led by a tour guide .they say that the guide knows better than us and he is capable to answer all kinds of question that we have ; therefore , we will be able to know everything about the thing that we are visiting .second group say that it is a bad idea because we have to consider the time factor .for example , if we liked somthing and we want to spend more time on it we would nt be able to do it becuase we are not alone .beign without a guide will give us the opportonity and the flixibility to do what we want whenever we want .both of the groups agreed that being with a tour would give them more information about the thing that they are visiting .again it depends on the people .if you asked me which you did , i would go with one .i do nt like to be rushed and i do nt like to be tied .being free is a good thing specially when when i am visiting new sites .
