i totally agree with the given statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .facts are there to remain , but the knowledge would create directions for a new creation or new development and a new mindset .as a student is young and has lot of capability to think , he has to capability to invent .inventions happen where there is complete knowledge and understanding of what you are thinking of .once the student understands the ideas and concepts , he starts visualizing them .the understanding of one idea or concept would lead to understanding many more concepts , because everyting is so inter related .the ideas would give the student a direction in which he can think and develop better ideas .he has the authority over the subject and ozzes with confidence and makes him a wise person .if i were to compare two people who have read a particular theory and one of them , say person ` a  has thouroughly understood the whole concept and person ` b  has not understood the theory at all but has mugged the whole theory , then the person ` b  according to me is no less than a computer , knows everything but has no knowledge whatsover as to what he has read .and person ` a  is human , the most intelligent animal .person ` b  can not put into utilization what he has read , just like how a computer can do nothing on itself , because he has not understood anything whereas , since person ` a  has understood the concept he can research and develop in that area .facts are important but understanding the ideas and concept is most important .
