in my opinion , i agree with that it is more important for students to understands ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts since it offers lots of advantages to students .among divers reasons i support this opinion , there are two reasons in that .first , throught understanding ideas , students may become more logical than before .for example , when i was a high school student , i would attend the experiment of sience class in laboratory .it makes me solve the teacher s prompt which makes me get a complicated theory in the science .in addition , the course of experiment in the science class helps me learn about new harmful phenomenons such as global warming , soil erosion , and so on which make me more sophisticated understanding the phenomenons .there for , i agree with that students must focus on understanding than learning facts since they would be logical .secondly , as students under standing ideas , they can become a specialist in the specific scholarships which makes all around the worlds thrive than before .for example , when i was a middle school student , i would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness .back then , particularly , my geography teacher had a special characteristic which expalin to understanding ideas untill a number of students perfectly graps the contents of geography .as a result , i could be a specialist in the geography and at the same time i had a major geography in the university .therefore , i prefer to understanding ideas than to concepts .as it is discussed above , i d like to understand ideas than to concepts since it provides lots of benefits to studen
