i partially agree with this statement for many reasons .young people have less responsability , they just have to study or work , or both , but after this they usually have spare time to spend with friends , having fun .this is a nice aspect of being young .young people have their things to think to , but rarely they re responsable for someone else s life .older people have more to think to .they usually have a family which brings a lot of joy , but also a lot of stress ; financial stress for example , parent s have to think how to earn many to go on , to make their children study and have fun .young people do nt have this type of problems and this makes their life more enjoyable , in a certain way .young people want to feel strong emotions and live new experiences .everything has to be intense : loud music , disco , staying out late at night .older people already lived these emotions , they know how it feels to be young , but they do nt need these feelings anymore .they belong to the past .i think that when one gets older , he finds joy and happyness in smaller things .for example just by spending an afternoon with his family or old friends .there s no need to stay up until the break of dawn , but just to live life and appreciate its simple things .this does nt means that older people can not have fun , it s just a different way of having fun .a young man s challenges are ( in my case ) : university exams , human relations , family life and a job to pay cd s and amusements .growing up one needs more , or ( i think ) should need more than just having fun dancing at the disco .after the studies one needs to find a job , someone to love and to start a new life on its own .a marriage is a great accomplishment .the partner and the sons become the most precious thing one could have .this is happyness .i do nt believe young people enjoy life more than older people .the way of having fun changes with time , but life is always enjoyable .
