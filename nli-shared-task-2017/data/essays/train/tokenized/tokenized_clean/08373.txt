i agree with the statement that `` it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .basically many people do not know the facts of certain reason or somthing else .they agree with the facts only when some others have strong reason to prove it .but if they are familiar with the concepts and ideas they can think of the and they can decide of it whether it is correct or wrong .consider the following example to prove my statement .in the earlier days when technology was not in the advanced state many people thought earth to be a flat surface and they followed it for a long time .but later on when a scientist discovered that earth was in spherical in shape the whole world was against him .he tried to prove it by certain laws and principles .but the people in those days were not able to understand his ideas and concepts .so , they argued with him and did not agree with his statement .later on when people began to understand his ideas and concepts agreed with him .another example is consider the subjects like mathematics or physics .if the student does not know the concept of the subject or does nt have an idea in it , he will not be to understand anything in it .suppose in physics we try to prove many facts using certain laws and concepts .the student should understand the concept to know the fact of that law .now a days many students are familar with the ideas and concepts .so , they try to obtain the fact from tere own concept and knowledge .nobody are required for the to prove the fact for them .so instood of trying to prove the fact for the students make them to know concept and idea of the fact .so , that they can understand the fact by themshelves without proving for them .so , if students understand ideas and concepts than knowing the actual fact , they can only conclude of the fact without others tring to prove the fact for them
