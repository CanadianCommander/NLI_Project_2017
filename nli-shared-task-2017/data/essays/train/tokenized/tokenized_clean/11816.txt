being successful is a combination of various elements and therefore it is a long process .people can be evaluated successful on one day but however , the other day may not bring success to that people . ..in order to be a successful , first the person should know what he or she is doing well .therefore , the first element shall be a deep knowledge in the area of practice .however , just knowledge shall not be deemed enough for the success .there shall be other supplemantary issues such as long term practice and right field of bussiness .a student graduating with the degree 3.8/4 from the university can be deemed as a succesful student .during his term at the university in order to grant the best graduation degree , he shall study and study .there is no place to risk in his university careear such as not studying .after graduating from the university he starts his careear as lawyer in one of the most reputiable law firms .his knowledge of law is great and therefore in order to promote in the law firm he shall do the best thing he knows .he is responsible to the clients who he is serving for .therefore , the memorandum drafted by a lawyer shall include solid grounds .otherwise , giving false information will cause the law firm to loose the client , in pother words for the lawyer to loose the promotion .the example indicated here above is just one simple example .success for a long term of period is much more vital .people can be famous and successful by taking risks and ntering in to the business in which they do not have any idea .however , this is just like gambling .people always starts to win small amount at the begining when they gamble .however , they losse big amounts afterwards .to conclude one sholud have patience to be succesful .
