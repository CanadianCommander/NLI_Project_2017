nowadays , people try to be successful in every ways .for example big business companies always try to open a new company .i think this lowers the quality because you ca nt be concentrated on a specific product , and you can use your whole effort on that subject .first , being concentrated on a specific topic is very important for a successful life .this specific topic could be everything in our live .it could be in business life , in academic life .for example , you will become a boss of the biggest company on your country with mechanical products for long vehicles .also you want show yourself to the other countries .you start to sell the farm products for gain more money but you could become unsuccessful because you do not know anything about a farm products you do not have any experinces abot farm product so how you could be successful without these important facts .if you concentrated on your major job maybe you could be the biggest in the world with your experinces .we could say also in academic world also you ca nt be a mechanical engineering teacher and a english literature teacher in same time .after these specific examples , we can make a result that you should focus on a specific subject .second , your effort is very important in successful .you always make one job in a day than two jobs in a day for a defined success .for instance , i never make good two things in a day but i make a wonderful one thing in that day because i use my all effort on one specific job .at the end , in my opinion , for being successful in life you should be concentrated on a specific subject and use your whole effort on that subject .there is a turkish speech like that : be an apple but best apple .
