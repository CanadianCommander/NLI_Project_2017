i am disagree with this knowledge based on many academic subjects .i believe people should be specialize on one subjects .as the whole academicans know , specialization just include of this academic subject s improvement .in the world history , development really related with specialization of persons .for example alexander grahambel just have experience based on telephone so that he could not be interest problems politcs within academic level .especially this specialization getting more important when the academic areas becoming more developed .after the industrial revolution whole academic areas clearly and quickly improved .this development process directly has relation with specialization s expanding in academic enviorements .thus , too many academician found new tolls , methots mental way for developmets of those specific areas .i think humans owes to those specialized persons for our current developed level .we are appreciate those person
