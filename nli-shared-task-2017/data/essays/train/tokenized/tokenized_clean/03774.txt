one can undoubtedly say , that everybody in our society strives for success .but what is the underlying principle leading to success ?some people claim that successful people are innovative , take risks rather than continuing working on what they already know well .in my opinion , this statement is true for many cases .people who try new things or take risks are more willing to explore their boundaries .this makes it more likely to come accross discoveries and ideas that are revolutionary and lead to and outstanding performance .also , these people are usually more adaptable than their collegues who prefer to stick to their old patterns and spend their entire life in an office , performing the same tasks everyday .risky people are usually at the forefront of their field , whereas people who do what they know well , will always lag behind .people who are open-minded perceive changes in their environment not as a threat , but as an opportunity and are able to take these chances to revolutionise an area .furthermore , people who are willing to take risks can not usually be discouraged easily by concerned friends or family when trying to set a very far-fetched idea into practice .a classic example of how being innovative lead to huge success is the story of a man working for a computer firm .this company had been specialised on the production of huge computers for a long time .this employee had the idea to build portable computers ( i.e. laptops ) .however , his idea was rejected by his boss .as a consequence , the employee resigned from his job and set up a company who built laptops .as we know today , his idea had been a huge success - and the company still suffers from being reluctant to adopt to this change .critics on the other hand may say that there is no recipe to success .just being bold and trying new things does not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome .also , moving too far away from ones s initial area of studies means that a lot of time must be invested in learning new techniques and theories , as many field require a substantial background knowledge in order to work in them .this , indeed , is a valid argument .however , as mentioned previously the attitude of people who are prepared to take risks is much more likely to lead to an outstanding discovery .clearly , there is no guarantee for success , but as the previous examples have illustrated , only people who are willing to take risks and search for the unexplored are likely way to become very successful .
