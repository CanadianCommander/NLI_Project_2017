i personally agree with the statement that `` it is important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  . cause it is enough for a student to understand the ideas and concepts .according to me , as a student , it is more important to have a clear idea and concepts of a topic rather than going for the facts .the students should get a clear idea and grip on the topic so that he can know the things well .students should first learn the things from their lecturers and then should have a knowledge on the particular subject , so gaining knowledge is really very important in building one s carrier .so the students should carefully follow the instructions given by the lecturer in order to understand all the concepts .for example , when i was doing my 10th class , i was very much interested in learning the facts rather than the subject .i allways use to spend time on finding out the facts and concentrated very less on the concept of the topic , as a result i got a poor grade in my acedemics .so after this my teacher advised me to understand the ideas and the concepts than to understand the facts .i followed the instructions given by the teacher , and performed very well in the next exams .so its really important to have the knowledge of the subject than the knowledge of the facts .so as i experienced personally , i can surely say that the student should have ideas and concepts of the topics .being a student its more than enough to get the knowledge of the particular subject , and under standing the concept of that particular subject than searching for facts . .so , i personally feel as a student , that understanding the ideas and the concepts is more important than to learn the facts .
