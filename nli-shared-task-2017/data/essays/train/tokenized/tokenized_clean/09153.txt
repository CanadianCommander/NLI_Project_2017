in recent years , our society is growing very fast .many new things have occured and many old things were eliminated .the reson why it is because people are trying to do new things and do something which they have never tried before rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .firstly , i believe the sentence `` no pain no gain  .the sentence shows that people need to sacrifice something in order to gain what they expected , especially taking risks .obviously , business man tends to produce new products in order to gain more profit .but the things is , they need to take a high risk and try things they have never tried before .they must have the courage to do some risky things .i do nt think they would continuoulsy doing the old things and having an `` old  return .that s are the main reasons why they become successful .secondly , i have heard about a theory `` high risk equals to high reuturn  .take students as an instance .the top students often spend a lot of time on their studies , they devoted themself for sacrificing their spare time and souls into studies .i believe they know that theory very well .the reson why they keep doing that is , they know they will have a good return for what they did .last but not least , successful people try to invent new things and doing new things .we can actually tell why the scientist are so successful on their performance to their works .it is because they know that if they try to do things that no body has done before , they will eventully become successful people by the honor given by the public .in conclusion , i think courage and patient are the two essential thing to become successful .successful people require these two elements , and they need them more that anybody in the world .that why they are successed .
