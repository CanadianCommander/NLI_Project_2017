in twenty years , i believe that there will be more cars in use than there are in today .however , there will be not such a huge difference .the difference will be about the car types .with the reason of limited petrol sources , the car manufacturers are already focused on different type of cars that run with different power like a electricity .furthermore , the usage of car , needs to be analsyzed under the type of customers expactatitons .the answer of the following question may give us clearer idea , `` why do the people need a car ?transportation , more comfortable , time saving are the sample reasons that the people always would have one .with the link question that i sated above , there are hundreds of different brands available in the market .it is not just about the brand also about different type of cars like luxury class , racing , diesel-economical , small or vagoon , etc .the another reason that there will be more cars in twenty years is high competitive market .if we look at any magazine or newspaper , we can easily see many different advertisements everyday .the car manufacturer always come up with better deal and better quality of product .as a summary , i do not agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the reason of finding different type power sources and also car manufactures  reasonable offers will always create a wish for consumer to have a car .
