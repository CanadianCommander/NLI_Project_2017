i think it depends on the age of the student .for young students , like secondary and high school it will be more important to to know about ideas and concepts .students at this age still at beginning stage or we can say learning state .they have learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future .even they may learn from what happening in the history .by learning theories , students will think about what will happened in the application of the theory .while the older students , at university for example , have to learn more the facts .they may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get .without ideas or concepts , students will not know whether it is right or not .older students should apply the theories they get in real life .then , by knowing the results , the new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results .this will be worthfull experience for studefor example , they are two kinds of cost in production , fix and variable cost .fix cost should not be change at any sum of productions .but when we increase or quantity any certain level , the fix cost will change .thus , ideas or concepts and facts support each other .learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts .because some of the facts may be come from ideas or concepts .the plane can fly is the fact .how the plane can fly came from the concept of researchers in their good calculation when making the plane .
