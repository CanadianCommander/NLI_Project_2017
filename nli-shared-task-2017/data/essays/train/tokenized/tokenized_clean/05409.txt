i completely disagree with this statement .i think that the whole world is mainly dependent on the life facts .mr. gandhi had said that if their is facts and truth in your life then you are on the verge to win the world .in a class room when many students are listening a perticular lecture .they mainly concentrate on the lecturer .they listen to the only part which the lecturer is saying .as a part of the study , lecturer provides them only the idea behind the topic .and accordingly the student follow the instructions of the lecturer .at this time students can not understand the topic because they have not any real example to support the topic .they just mug the topic and leave it as a part of assignment and some may think that it is only a part of our syllabus .on the other hand some students go in deep .they analyze the topic .they dont mug the topic .they approach each other or go through the book to understand the concept behind the topic .but in book , it is not compulsary that every book has mentioned the reality of the topic and from where it comes .but some book conceptually explain this very well .various concepts are provided for a single thing .now student has multiple option for a single thing .fourtunately their topic becomes more clear by using this much amount of the concepts provided by the books .but when they come in real life these concepts are worthless because there can not be a  idea  to handle the situation .they do not know the facts about the life and by that they can not survive in this confused world .most of the time , the facts of the life are useful than ideas and concepts .for doing science and mathematics study ideas and concept works but in real life the student should be aware of facts of life .life works on facts and truth not on illusive ideas and concepts though they are useful in study and in doing business .
