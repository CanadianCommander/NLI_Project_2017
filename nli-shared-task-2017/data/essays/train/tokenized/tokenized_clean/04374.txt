publicity is everywhere in our lives ; it spreads from the billboard across the street to the 5 minutes coming right at peak suspense of our favorite tv show .the idea of publicity is to make customers want to buy one product .there are several ways to achieve this goal , whether you make your audience laugh , or you get them excited or thrilled .the point is to make them feel good about themselves .for that , as no product itself can do that rightaway , it seems obvious to me that most advertisers to make their products look better than they really are .first , we can see that there is an issue of subjectiveness as it comes to deciding wether or not a product is shown `` better  than he really is .there can be different point of views about the `` goodness  of a product .but generally , no product reaches in real life the level of greatness that advertisements show .what is interesting to notice is that people are wholly aware of the exagerations that advertisements provide , but they agree to think that it is part of the game .no one actually believes everything that is shown on television .they know they wo nt yum everytime they eat a yoghurt , and they wo nt have an orgasm everytime they drink their coffee .this system preserve itself .if an advertisement has hard time sticking strictly to its product real qualities , the product will look flat compared to the other products displayed .it shows that an advertisement does have to emphasize and improve the qualities of the product it is advertising for .of course there are legal limitations to the extense advertisers can get in making their product look good : this is important not to get into lies as far as quality is concerned .to conclude , i think that it is in the essence of advertisement to show people an idealistic world
