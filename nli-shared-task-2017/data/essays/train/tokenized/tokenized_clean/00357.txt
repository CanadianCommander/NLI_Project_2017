i disagree with the statement because i do nt think two people s experience of joy of life can be compared , be they young or be they old .but i would like to consider this intriguing question by looking at the development of my person enjoyment of life .from my own experience of now 32 years in this life , i believe that the quality of life s experience changes over time even for a single person .consequently , i enjoy life very differently today than 25 years ago , i.e. some things i found pleasure in as a child are today meaningless or boring , such as hours on the playground , or even repulsive , of which i will not give examples .instead , there are many new things i discovered , such as reading books , travelling , professional achievements , making love or meditation , which i would not have enjoyed much as a kid .besides enjoying different activities , the feeling of happiness or joy itself has evolved .i recall happiness as a kid as more immediate , combined with less awareness of such a state of emotion , while happiness today is often something i register while enjoying it .the intensity of either kind of happiness can be overwhelming , while each feeling corresponds to the degree of maturity i have reached .there are some things i fear will get lost will growing old , such as curiosity , spontaneity , mental agility and physical fitness , which i consider important driver of joy in life .however , there are some capabilities or assets that i will only have fully developed or built when older , such as patience , more refined senses ( including humour ) , but also family and a strong social network or personal relationships .especially friends and family are sources of joy i expect to compensate for the loss of those other springs of bliss which will probably loose importance over time .i do nt think young people enjoy life more than old people or vice versa , i think both have to work hard to make most out of it and find the right ways to get the most out of the changing conditions under which we go through life .if successful , life can be enjoable all along .
