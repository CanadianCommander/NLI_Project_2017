i partly agree and disagree .on the one hand i consider a broad knowledge of many academic subjects as something valuable , something that makes you a better scientist or researcher as you might get a broader view on a problem .on the other hand specializing in one specific field helps you to concentrate on specific problems - you have the chance to go beyond the surface of a field or subject without getting sidetracked .it depends on where you see your career and on your talents .if you want to work in - let s say - medical research , than a broad knowledge of modern and ancient languages , philosophical ideas and schools might turn you into an interesting conversation partner , but it clearly does nt help you to come up with a cure for cancer .to come up with a cure for a desease - that is actually hundreds of different deseases - you have to specialize in your specialization - and you have to start at an early point with that .if you want to work as a philosopher than your works will benefit from a broad - but still deep - knowledge .some people might ask , what we need philosopers for , but that is a different question .so the question is more should the universities give students the chance to `` linger around  , to change subjects , to build an academic personality if this is necessary for their chosen field of career .it seems that today no-one is willing to give you the time and resources to develop your academic profile over a long period .which is a pitty as so many praised authors and scientist founded their career and their ideas on the broad knowledge they established over a long period of learning .the trend goes towards shorter education periods as finacial resources are limited .this is unfortunately a fact that we ca nt change .sad is , that the decisions made towards shorter , specialized education systems are mostly based on financial considerations and they hardly leave room for exceptions .
