in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are todayactually , i do not agree with this statement .the world is growing .the cities are expanding .and the world population is increasing .people needs transportation to transport from one site to another inside the city and even outside .i agree that there are variety of transportation .for example , buses , metroes , and airplanes .but usually people like to drive .they like to have there own car and travel with there family through the country .some countries , there are no metroes .and some countries have minimal numbers of buses .in my country , we do not have metroes , small number of buses and we have only one airplane company .in my country , we are not used to use bus or even taxi .we usually use our cars .cars can not be replaced by other transportation .some people will not feel comfortable without using a car especially their cars .other transportations can help in decreasing crowdeness but that does not mean that they will replace the car .mostly .everyn body in the entire world would like to have a car even if he or she transports by other than car .i think reduction in numbers of cars in use will be challenging .and i think it will take more than twenty years to decrease the usage of cars in my country in the entire world .
