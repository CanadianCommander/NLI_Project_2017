i agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .students should understand the ideas and concepts , so they can know the answer .and if the students dind nt do that , they will have no choice to do taht again .students understand ideas and concepts can develop their knowledge .during they thinking for the reason , they can know how to answer it .for example , the teacher let the students to do their homework , only write the reasn .so a lots will copy theirclassmates  homework .that is unuseful .but if theteacher to tell the students to write down how they answer those questions , so the students must do that by themselves , that will give the students a lot of hep .students can know that how to answer the questions .for example , when the students understand the ideas and concepts , that means they also can know the way to answer those question .that can give them a lot of help for their future .the students always know the things from understand something , that can make them to know that thing clearly .for example , it likes that people can learn things from doing that .that can make them to know that more easier and clearly .let the students to understand the ideas and concepts are also can make them to know a lot of things about the life .for example , to understand the ideas can make them know that it is life .in their life , they must still find the way to answer all the qwuestion .they must use the different ways to answer the different questions .no body can help them expect themselves .the students ca nt learn facts expect they understand the ideas and concepts .if they did nt understand the ideas and concepts , they would nt learn the right facts , they will not understand the facts , so when that time , they will have the wrong thinging for the facts .so that is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts .they can study how to have their life and can know more knowledges from that .
