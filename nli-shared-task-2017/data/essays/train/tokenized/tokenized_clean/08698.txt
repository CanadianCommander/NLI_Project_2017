when i was studying in school , i also felt that `` why we have to learn junk subjects  .however , i really agree about the many academic subjects are good for knowledge , because it provide lots of opportunities , i mean it s good for future .in my life , when i was second grade in middle school , a teacher gave a homework to us which was find your talant .after school , i tried to think what am i good at or what do i like .however , i could nt , because i could nt find my talants .however , after highschool finally , i found my talants .my talant is a law .when i was first grade in highschool , i had a friend who called che-jea-heong .he was very special friend .he always tried to think strange way .first , i did nt want to talk with him , but when we talked about the talant , we became a friend .actually , his father is police .and his family is very poor .so , first we started to talk his father , why he is poor .after that we started to think law .then we found our talant .actually , this i found this talant from the school project .when i was 3grade in middle school , i had a class which was korean language class , but at that class , we had a special study which was law .because , my teacher thought law is good for stundent .so we tried to study the law just one period with a game .however , my friends are really bored about this , but me i was really enjoyed that law class .so after that period , i said to the teacher that study more laws , but she could nt , because lots of people did nt like that .anyway , i really like the law , also i ll go to the law university .from this reason , i can think many way to find my talant from the school subjects .i can think math , science , music or art .so we can include our opportunities .now days , many students can not understand the school about the acadmic subjects that why they have to learn too much subject , i was too , but now i agree from the school .and i really thanks from the school .
