nowadasys the rythm of life is becoming more and more frantic , and this is quite evident and clear to all of us .anyway i m not of the opinion that today we are losing values and dedicating our time to unuseful or trivial things .i strongly desagree with the statement proposed and defenitely do nt want to believe that young people do nt spend time helping the community they live in .first of all , i want to notice that the chances , offered by society , to join voluntary activities and projects , are much more publicized today than before .thanks to technological progresses , our wide and fast way of communication make it easier to know the great variety of opportunity for helping someone and somewhere that everyday comes out : from workcamps to sport events , from working with children to bringing help to old people who live alone , and so on .the environment a young volunteer can find himself in , is never the same so he/she does nt get bored .moreover , the several opportunities are available for all the ages , there are not volunteers too young or to old , just volunteers that want to get on their bike and work a bit for the others .i had a personal experience that gave me an important teaching and that i hope my children will desire to do too .last year i joined a group of 23 international volunteers in kenya and the aim of the project was to build a road ( or may i should say a way ) in the middle of a forest to make children able to go to school .it has been an experience unforgettable from many points of view : we were helping that african community and they were very kind with us , we lived in strict contact , so i got the chance to know a different culture in a deep way .concluding , i believe that today young people have in mind that every opportunity to help the community and to join a voluntary project , can be an extremely significant tool to mature and also a cultural exchange as much important as unexpected .
