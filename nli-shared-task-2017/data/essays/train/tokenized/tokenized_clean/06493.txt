i think that it is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects because there are many reason for this .first , i think if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjets you will have a better chance for a job in the future life .companys or firms will search people who have a big knowlegde of many subjects .also this people have the ability to help in many departments .so for example , if they have had varios ecnomic subjects they can work in every department of the firm or company .secondly if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects it is good for yourself .you save the feeling that you have learn a lot and that this what you learned can help you in many situation of your futher life .so for example you can help people which needs any statement from you .thirdly i think it is very busy to have many academic subjects because you have a lot to learn .so maybe you have nt got the time to meet your friends , to do some sport activities or something else .there are also people who prefer it to specialize in one specific subject , but in my opinion i think that these people are nt interested in other subjects and maybe they have nt got the interest to learn .they more likely to meet friends or do sport activities .for these people personality life like the hobbys a sport acativities or meet friends are more important than the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in addition , to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject i think because it helps you in many situations as like in your job or personal situations .
