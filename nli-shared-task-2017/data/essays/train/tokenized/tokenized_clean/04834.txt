i could not say that every young person dedicate themselves to helping their communities , but i do think that a large number of them are doing a large amount of voluntary work to help make a better community .i have witnessed many participations in social service by young people around me .when i was in high school in hong kong , the city where i live , almost everybody at school joined at least one volutary activity , be it elderly home visit or fund-raising carnival .some put a lot of effort into organizing these voluntary work , while others supported by generous donation or active participations .we all enjoyed being involved in these activities , knowing that we are contributing to our communities .i have personally contributed and experienced community work , too .as members of the hong kong red cross youth units , my team mates and i have initiated a few service projects which served the objectives of charity organizations .we designed a 3-day programme , which included a fun day for elderly and children , to convey messages such as social harmony and cross-generation communication .all of us have dedicated ourselves into the preparation and launching of the projects .it was time-consuming but we all believed that it was worth making a more joyful community .helping the communities is not only demonstrated by actual participation in voluntary work .i think that the young people who are really making contribution are those who manage their time well between voluntary work and academic study .we should always look at things in the long term .instead of complaining that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , maybe we should appreciate how they are trying to get the most of their study and contribute to the society later on .that means that they are not wasting the resources that the society is giving them in their education .they also prove that the ` investment  in their education will generate returns when contribute what they learn back to the society .are nt they helping their communities , too ?many young people are actually aware of their positions in their communities and are giving a lot of time to help .we should appreciate what they have done and encourage those who are doing less to contribute more .ultimately they will be the ones who benefit from a better community they themselves live in .
