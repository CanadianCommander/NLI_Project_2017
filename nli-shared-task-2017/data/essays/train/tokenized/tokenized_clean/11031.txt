the issue of whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a controversial one .on the one hand , being young is attributed with enthusiasm and health which are both catalysts of enjoyment .on the other hand , the process of growing up undergoes many physical and mental changes which might alter the enjoyment of life .i personally believe that a smaller age has no influence on happiness due to many reasons .first , let me define young and old .young is a person aged from 0-30 , while an older person is aged from 30 and more .according to my observations and to my personal experience , older people have the ability to enjoy their life better .one reason of my belief is that young people have not enough expertise in life to enjoy it the best .for instance , a 15 year old might feel frustrated because of peer pressure at school and he lacks the cognitive means and the maturity level to deal with his problem .a 35 year old man would know how to deal with his problem because he has enough experience in life and he has lived enough to pass through all kinds of the problems that youngsters suffer from .a second reason to my belief is that an older persons have access to the means of entertainment better than young persons .an adult is allowed to a night club , is allowed to drink , to get married , to have children , etc. while the young s enjoyement of life might be controlled by his parents , his age , his external environement .perhaps the most important reason to my belief is that adults are psychologically stable .their physical and mental changes have already passed through all the intriguing stages that might cause frustration to youngsters .for example a 40 year older would maybe already be settled in a house with children , a fixed job and a routinic life .in contrast , a younger person would have to worry about highschool grades , college , love , settlement , money and many other issues that are of no certainty to the person .in conclusion , i would certainly feel that as we go with time we might enjoy life better since we are about to have a more secure way of living , less uncertainties and of course no more physical and mental changes to worry about .
