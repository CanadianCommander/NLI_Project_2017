some say that sticking to one specific subfect , you can be specialist of one subject .i , however , think it is much better and efficient to have broad knowleadge of many academic subjects .if you have many field knowledge , you can ajust society , find what you really want to do , and apply it to your majior .to begin with , you can do well after getting job , if you have broad knowledge .for example , in my company , which is mecanic compay , management is nesessary , since without management , the company ca nt earn money .all of the people in my company is engeneering majior .however , the trend of my company is good , since i have a experience in businessmajior and i m a managor of this company .my knowledge about business saves my company .nest , if you know a lot of things , you can find what you really want to do .i was a business majior befor taking reveral arts .however , i canged my majior after taking engeneering i took as a minor , since i was fasnated by it .i thought engeneering enable us do a lot of thing s like magic .if i d just learnd about business , i could nt have find how engeneering fited me .finally , you can apply your knowledge even though it is not related to your majior .in my friend s example , he reaearchs in biological center and his majior is biology .however his has great knowledge of mathematics and found the important rule in living creatures which is only explaind by mathematics .he cariculated all things in the world is related each other and that mens only extinction of one kind of small creature may threat human s life .all in all , for these reasons , i think that it much more profitable to have wide view of many academic subjects .it can help you to adjust any situation in society , find what you can really stick to , and apply your majior .
