the understanding of ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for education of youth people .i am strongly agreed with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea .in the first place , the importance of understanding our history and facts does not only depends on our knowledge of the facts , but also the comprehension of why all of the things are and was happening in our world .the world war ii was the most cruelty war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts .beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas of how to rule the world .furthermore , i can see the reasons of bringing a country to the war as the united states did to that war .the us could see people have thier natural rights which are inherited to human being such as freedom or religion .these are ideas .second , we use ideas and concepts not only to find out facts , but also to learn about our future problems and facts .math is a science that you have to understand theories and concepts to solve the problem .third and finally , i think ideas and concepts create a critical inspiration to the society , which makes us better observers of the world .in this case , we should to recognise the roots of poverty to improve this world and the ideas and concepts can bring these solutions .in conclusion , i think the more ideas and concepts we understand , the better comprehension of world we have .it is more important to know the why than to know because and the same fact , because history can repeat the same idea
