travelling is the best way ever to explore the world , discover new places and rest .some people prefer to spend that time in a group with a tour guide and other prefer to stay alone .i will definitely say that i disagree because , by myself i can visit whatever i want , i will never get bored by the discussion and i can rest whenever i want .first of all , the worse thing when you re in vacation is to be obliged to do exactly what the majority wants to do .because you are in a group of different people you can do what you want to do , of course .you have to go where everybody is going , eat where every body eat .instead of that , when you are by yourself you can decide exactly what you want to visit without being contrary .for example i was in italy for vacation with a group of people .i really wanted to visit a very famous museum , but i could nt because it was nt on the program of the day .secondly what is nt benefict for my vacation , is to get bored by the discussion .when you in the group , at certain time the guide tour have to talk about the history of the city , the people . ..most of the time those subjects are nt interesting .i ca nt imagine myself in vacation laying on the beach while the guide tour is talking about origin of the beach in the world or something else .finally , the most important thing while you re in vacation or when you travelling is to be able to rest when you want to .one day i was in germany with some friend of mine and a tour guide .every morning at seven oclock he was supposed to wake up everybody for the break fast time .that made me so mad because i could nt rest at all .contrary , when you are by yourself , you do nt have to worry about the time or rushing anywhere .so you can have more time to rest base on the fact that you are your own guide .
