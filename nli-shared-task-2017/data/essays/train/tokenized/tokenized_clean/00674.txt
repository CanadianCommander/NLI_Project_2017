some people know a lot about a lot of different topics , some other would just know about something specific .knowledge is obviously important for your everyday life and for your career , but is it better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?it is sometimes important to learn and know a lot about just one subject , especially for some kind of works .for example , people would probably not be sure if you try to operate them without an surgeon s diplom , which proves that you know what you are doing .that is the same way when you are looking for a lawyer .you generally go to the one who is known as the best specialist .on a personal experience , some specific cultures as chinese or japanese like when you seem to be a specialist about something : they will trust you easily for business negociations .on the other hand , most of business places do nt necessarly require to have specific knowledge in one specific subject , but expect you to know about a lot of different subjects .in that way you may be able to show to recruiters or partners that you can adapt yourself to a lot of different situations .besides , to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a good thing for your own personality .indeed , you can discover that thanks to this , the world is full of controversions and different things .however , it is hard to say that one way is better than the other one , because it mostly depends of the situation .as a business student , i would say that it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because it allows you to speak with more people , and developp your own personality .even if it is hard to master every subjects , it enlarges your general culture , which is good for everybody .
