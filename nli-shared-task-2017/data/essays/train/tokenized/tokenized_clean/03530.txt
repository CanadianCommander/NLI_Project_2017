i think that s right .young people do nt give much time for their communities .i think this is mainly because of the todays  life style .we think very often in an egoistic manner , looking only at ourselves , without thinking of other s that might need our help .i think it depends mainly on parents and society education that is given to youg people .today , we live in a fast and crazy world and there is not a lot of time for educational purposes .all the time is spent at work , or watching tv , or going around pubs and so on and we forget the most important things of life , like having respect of it or being happy for things that life gives us every day .for example , there are few people that would nt do a work for their community without being payed .an example may be the beach cleaning activity of some organizations like wwf or greenpeace .that spend their time to clean our fun places . ..but there are very few young people that do that .an other example may be spend time for people that need help , like older people or that affected by a handicap .those people feel often alone and a little help would be surely appreciated .young poeple are nt interested in politics either , but politics is important because it has much influence on our life .future society will consist of people who are young now , and because of this it is important to now things enrolled in politics or in other points of view of our society
