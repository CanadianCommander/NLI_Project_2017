in fact , people usually think that life is more enjoyable when a person is a teenager .i actually dont agree with this idea .i think it depends on the personality rather than the age .in this passage i will try to explain my opinion .first let us have a look at the periods of life .a child usually seems happy with his or her toys .and a young boy may enjoy the time that he spend with his girl friend .a young lady may find her hobbies or interests after her work time .an old lady may be very happy when she is with her grandchildren .these are really a sight through the window of an optimistic person , are not they ?thus , it can easily be seen that a person can enjoy the life at any age .although these examples can be expansed , we can sometimes ran into pessimistic people .when an optimistic person can be happy with his bicycle , small but pretty house etc. an optimistic can look for the ways in order to be worried .this kind of somber person usually copmplains about unnecessary things like not having much money , not being a famous person , etc .i think , this kind of pessimist people cant be simply happy even if they are 17 years old .from this it can be concluded that i dont agree the statement and believe that a person at any age can enjoy the life .i have talked about the periods of life and gave examples of both optimist people who enjoy the life and pessimists who makes life harder unnecessarily .according to me , every person may not enjoy life as much as others , however , it shouldnt be forgotten that every age gives the same chance to enjoy .
