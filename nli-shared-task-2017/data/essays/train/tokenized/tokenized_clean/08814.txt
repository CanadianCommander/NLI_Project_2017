some people disagree the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .however , personally i agree the statement for the following reasons .first , traveling with a tour guide could save time .for example , in 2005 i traveld to italy with my mother by using a tour company .my mother and i wanted to go to italy for a long time and so we were looking forward to visiting museums and historical places .however , there are many museums and famous places in italy .we worried about how would we do to see efficiently .we consulted with our tour guide and she gave us good advice .she changed out tour route to be able to visit efficiently , where we wanted to go .this example clearly shows that traveling with a tour guide could save time .second , traveling with a tour guide could learn more .when i perticipated in the tour goint to india in 2004 , i were led by a indian tour guide .we went to many temples , but i did not have much knowlege of hindu and muslim , indian religions .then , he lectured me the religion and the means of pictures and structures in the temples .also , he answered my questions .for example , what is the most famous person in india , what is the most popular occupation among indian women and so on .i could learn many things from the guide .the above experience demonstrates that traveling with a tour guide could learn more .therefore , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
