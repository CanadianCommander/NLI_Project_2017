ford , the genius who created the assembly line , in order to manufacture more cars in a smaller amount of time .since then , the production of cars have increased rapidly .the cheaper and faster manufacturing of cars increased the production .supplying the comfort of cars to most of the the world s population .in my opinion , i think that there will be more cars than there are today .today s scientists are testing to create a new model of cars in order the decrease the greenhouse effect .there has been the invention of oil with the use of corn , however it has not been put ot effect yet due to the cost of cars which can function with that specific type of oil .however , as the supply of oil will run low throughout the years , the demand for corn oil would rice guaranteeing the hygiene and the cleaness of the air in the environment .therefore , the people will not have to stress out about polluting the environment like today s cars .the population over the year has risen rapidly .over the next 20 years it is guaranteed that the population statistics chart will keep soaring higher and higher .the increase of population indicates that more cars will be needed for transportation .as i have stated in the previous paragraph of the hygiene of the corn oil , people would not have to worry about the greenhouse effect turing the earth into a giant fire ball , or the glaciers melting and rising 100 meters above sea level .due to the increase of population the production of cars will keep increasing as well .the increase in population soon will not be able to fit all the population in one metropolis .as the cities become crowded the people will move out of the cities into suburbian areas .therefore , travelling will be necessary on a dailiy basis for most people who work in the center of the city , or have school in the cities .due to the transportation needed everyday , many people will consider to buy a car .therefore , the amount of cars in the streets will increase , along with the areas of the cities and the population in the world .cars will soon be a necessary object , which the population of the world will rely heavily on .therefore , the fluctuating of the amount of cars will not happen .as long as ford remains in our history books as the father of cars , the decreasing of ford s invention will not happen .
