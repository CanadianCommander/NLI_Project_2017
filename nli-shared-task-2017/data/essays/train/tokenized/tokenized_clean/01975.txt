i totally agree with this statement .in fact , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but this is necessary .i do not think , that it is right to cheat buyers in this way , but i also can understand the reasons for these behaviour .on the one hand , the firms had to attract people to buy their product .they want to make as much profit as they can to establish their enterprise .but they have to be better than other firms , who sell the same products .so all of them have to made their product look like the best product off all , to give the buyer confident in this product .a car is a product , which has got a lot of advertisement on tv , or anywhere else .when the people see those beautiful cars on tv , driving through nice - looking streets and with an entire family sitting in there , all smiling and laughing , it is normal , that they get the feeling of an unbeatable , ultimate product .the voice on tv tells you , how cheap it is and that you must get it , if you do not want to miss anything in your life .in this situation , everyone , espacially those , who already has the intention of buying a new car , wants ` this  new car .but also younger participants of the family are lured by the beautiful made - up products on tv .for example any kind of potato chips or ice creams .seeing the people in the advertisement , eating those well smelled and nice - looking potato chips or ice creams , the smaller ones even can not get away from the television .it seems , that the ice cream tastes so good , that they also want to get one of them instantly .but in reality , when you are getting the product shown on tv , it is not so good as it is shown .often the buyer gets dissappointed even by seeing the car in front of them .sometimes it does not really look as the same on television .of course it can not be the same !the firms only show products on televion , that have been corrected with the help of computers to make it look better .in real life , no car in the world will shimmer in this way .but it can also accure , that the product does not contain all the opporunities , which are promised in the advertisement .so , to make a conclusion to all off this above , it is really unfair of the firms to cheat people , in order to attract them , to buy their products .but as we all can see , it works .perhaps , we should not always believe things we see on tv instantly , to avoid the feeling of disappointment , after buying the product .
