i clearely disagree with this statement above for the following reasons :maybe on a first impression , young people often seem to have more fun because they are able to take part in activities like doing sports , going to parties and traveling .clearely , some of these activities ca nt be done by older people mainly for physical reasons .but on the other hand , there are still many activities remaining that are even more suitable to be done by older people : first of all , there are characteristic ways to engage in sports for older people , like hiking , swimming and playing golf and chess .they even may have the advantage of perhaps having practiced this kind of sport for several years and can now acchieve greater , more satisfieing success .second , there are a lot of opportunities to meet other people in several clubs or on bus tours .in these occassions they may even meet people that share the same interests .finally , a lot of old people start traveling all after the world once their done with their career .at this point , it is important to mention , that in an older age one has a much greater amount of freetime he can use for any of those activities he likes most .that s due to the fact , that in childhood and youth one has to go to school , to study or to work in a job .i personally know older people , who really began travelling all over the world because they finally had the time to do so .so it is obvoius , that there many possibilies for older peo so finally , one can conclude , that you can only answer this question for yourself , depending how `` fun  is definded and how it can be measured in your eyes .
