i agree with the following statement .successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i have three reasons that i want to support my point of view .first of all , i think that if a person is always feel passion on meet new people , learn new things , try new stuff , that means they are not afraid they did wrong thing at least they tried .it not a big deal for them because they have a stronger attem than other people .in addtion , learn more thing that you do nt now is good to you .for examle , i am learing a new method for solving math equation , and by doing this , i ll understand more solution that other people do nt know .so , i am being a better student that the other person .secondly , i find out that to do such new thing is a littel bit hard for most of the people becasue they are not good at .however , if they break that mind which seems nervus and afraid , they ll go trough it and will get a lot of fun by knowing fresh things .further more , changing your mind and learn will make you enjoy the thing what you do , i think this is also a big idea that those successful people have .thirdly , i believe that most of the successful people have attempt for their goals , they uses certain ways , very active and powerful ways as the process they ll do .for example , once when i was haveing a dinner with my parents , they ve give me some good ideas and i never forget about them .the ideas are if you never try , you never win .and the other one is if you learn more than other people , you ll get more chance than other people .those are the words i always remember and i realized the life from real , things just like those words .lastly , to conclude based on the reasons that i gave above , i agree with the following statement .successful peple try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
