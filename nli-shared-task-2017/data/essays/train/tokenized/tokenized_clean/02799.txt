according to my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .because even they do nt know the concept clearly it is not possible to solve any problem regarding topic .suppose we have a problem to solve , then first we have to understand the problem clearly and we have to think about ideas to solve the problem .then only we can solve the problem easily .even we know all facts about that problem , we ca nt do any thing .for example , if student has given a puzzle to solve , then he knows all the facts about solving puzzle .he knows all the rules in solving puzzle , without implementing any ideas he ca nt solve the problem .the main purpose of implementation of ideas is to choose the shortest way and less time to solve that .here for the student not only to know the facts within the problem , he has to know the whole concept around the problem then only he would get new ideas which are to be implemented in solving the problem .after the learning of concept about the problem we have to understand the ideas which have to be implemented insolving problem .not only to learn facts , definitely understanding and let them know the concepts .the students who have learn facts , ca nt do anything without practical implementation .we have to improve them from the learning stage in practical method in every aspects .this practical method contains that understanding the concept clearly and thinking about the ideas to solve any thing .its better to prepare them mentallyt that they are in practically .so as far as i concerncerned first thing for students is understanding the concept .at finally i conclude it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
