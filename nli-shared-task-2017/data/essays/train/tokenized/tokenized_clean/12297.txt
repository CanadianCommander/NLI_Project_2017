advertisements exist to sell people products they do not need .this idea explains the ambition of modern advertising and marketing strategies .our modern society is based on capitalistic and often superficial values , and while making products seem better than they actually are , advertisements do notthing but reflect the social values .personally , i would say that modern product managers do not have the choice to sell their products as they really are .the economy in our so called developped countries has reached a level of saturation and offers more products than people actually need .therefore , those who want to sell their products will have to make high investments and develop good advertisement strategies .this guarantees them a good visibility of their products and good chances to sell them .i also believe that modern advertisements respond to a demand from society .today , we are all looking for the exeptional , the beautiful , the luxuary .in many cases , we do not want to buy a prpoduct but we want to buy a dream .this means , that we often prefere to buy an illusion rather than the reality .for instance , the latest shower liquid from ralph lauren seems much more attractive to us than a good soap , which would probably have the same effects on our body care .modern advertisement has to make products seem better than they really are , because customers are asking for it .this is nether good or bad , it is a simple fact .netherless , we should be aware of this fact and not be disappointed when the dream we just bought remains a dream .
