yes , i do agree with the quoted statement .i think success is connected to new things and risks .as an example you can regard the opening a new business .if you want to found a company or a new business , you have to take several risks .first of all you do not know whether your potential customer will like or accept your offered product or serivce .but you have to invest captial in order to be able to offer your goods .of course there is the risk of losing this invested money , if your articles are not requested on the market .on the other hand , it may lead to success and it will pay off serval times .another aspect is the innovation of your business .you must be better than your compeditors to be succesful .new products by inventions or imporvements are a must to survive on the market .a favourable price and quality is also a strategy to reach your targets of success .a succesful company lays its focus on innovation .as a matter of fact you must offer something , that your compeditors are not able to .this can be a new product .but not only from the perspective of a company but also as a succesful employee you must provide your target group , who ever that is , with something new that other can not offer .as i have mentioned before , this takes work and investments before , which may not be paid off directly .but that is the risk of success .a too high degree of security does not permitt competition .i think competition will lead to the highest degree of performance in total .i can understand why people fear taking this risk because they depend on a direct income , but you should always try to experience new things and try new methods .the first one with somthing fresh and new has a small number of compeditors and low competition .if it is requested what you are offering , it will lead you to success .
