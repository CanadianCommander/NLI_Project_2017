some ideas and concepts there is no facts but lot of ideas and concepts proved as a facts .facts are little important for students to understand ideas and concepts for that he just have an understanding power .for example , if we take a physics class that most of the physics subject is any imaginary part of the science .they first get the idea and after that they try to prove that idea into concept after that prove into fact .if we take newton under the apple tree .when he sat under the apple tree one apple fall down then he got an idea `` why this apple fallen down ?why it is not gon up ?  with this idea he found gravitation .with this extent there is no use of the facts to under stand the idea or concepts .one more example , if we take a maths therams , students do not understand the idea and concept just explains that therams , similarly any problem in the mathamatics have some facts to understand the idea or concept .if we take a formula ( a+b ) ^ 2 there is some proof is there that is the fact .another example , one lecturer says that mahathma gandhi is a freedom fighter there the concept is clear but if the student ask s the lecturer is it write lecturer , then the he gives some to facts about he did in the freedom fighting .facts are not important in some places .but if we have to show that it is true then it is important to explain the facts .the-end
