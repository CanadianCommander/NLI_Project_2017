many people are trying to succeed in their career .some of them fails , but others can reach the goal .those people who became successful , used to work very hard but to be very well skilled .when a person succeeds , then they are more likely to chalenge themselves .because they feel more satisfaction , they feel like they need to try themselves in higher position and in a risky situation .when somebody has already succeeded on their normal life , they become proud of themselves .they feel happy and tend to have more self-confidence .that motivates the person to try something new and more successful things .they also could do everything what they would like to do if they have succeeded the most difficult in their life .then , that person , because he/she believes that everything will be fine , starts preparing to do new things .even when something goes wrong , they believe that it could be solved quickly with their own experience and knowledge .those backgrounds before being a successful people is another strengh to keep them trying on a new things .another reason for people who takes risk is because they want the profe of being so well .being such charismatic person is to say like being a hero .they want to realize and show other people that they are really a great person who does nt feel satisfied of what they already achieved .they want to see how much they can do further .all in words , successful people want to try new things for their own pleasure .they need to continue challenging something to be sure that they can go higher more than they are now .that desire of going upper is what makes the person chalenge in whatever thing they whant to achieve .that s why the ones who reached the goal keep trying themselves to continue being better .
