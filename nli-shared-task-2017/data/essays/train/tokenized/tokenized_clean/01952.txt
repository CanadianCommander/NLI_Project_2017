i totally agree with this statement .i m really convinced that having a widespread knowledge of many different subjects is better than specializing on just one of them because of several reasons .first of all , since i m not sure of where i m going to be or what i m going to do in the near future i d rather prefer to have many choices in front of me , many paths to run instead of focusing on just one way that maybe could even be the wrong one .acting like this i will get ready and prepared to take any valuable opportunity aroused along my personal scholastic journey .in addition to this , i think that specializing on only one topic would be more boring and annoying than approaching different types of subjects .in spite of opening and studying every day the same books and the same lectures i believe that daily shifts from one subject to another could make your life more appealing , still keeping the chance to drop the courses which do nt match your initial expectations .finally the most important reason , my personal thirst of knowledge .since i was a child i used to read any kind of book , to watch any type of program and to observe everything that could strike my attention so i would really love having at my disposal a broad experience and knowledge in order to say my opinion in each context .i want to be a person ready to explain my beliefs wherever i am , whatever i `` m talking about without feeling uncomfortable or inappropriate .hope to be like this . ..
