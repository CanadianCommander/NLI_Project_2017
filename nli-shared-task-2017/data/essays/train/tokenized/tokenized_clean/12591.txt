nowadays , the world is moving at such a fast pace that it would be very difficult for me to agree or disagree on whether cars can become fewer , since i ca nt predict what kind of turn the future can take .so many technologies and various inventions are taking place that it is definately possible for the cars to be fewer in another twenty years .cars have become such a necessity in our daily lives that , i feel that cars could probably never cease to be fewer as life goes on .cars have brought such a big impact on our lives that it would be impossible to think of a life without cars and basic transportation .cars are our way of life - a necessity , which we on any given circumstance ca nt live without .our life , thesedays , revolves around going from one place to another , transporting goods and other facilities and other various activities connected with transportation .to think that twenty years from now there could be fewer cars on our roads , than there are today is not impossible , it is definately a possibility as the world is progressing and coming up with so much newer and varied forms of technologies and ideas .it would definately be a big misinterpretation of the fact - that the world is nt moving on , if i would say that cars can not be replaced by something much more sophisticated and efficient for our daily lives .in today s world , nothing is impossible .there is always a possibility for the human mind to come up with anything impossible .so coming up with a replacement mode of transportation would nt be too diffcult .therefore , i would say , that maybe not twenty years from now , but definately somewhere in the future there will be a good and efficient replacement for our cars , thus resulting in fewer cars on our roads .
