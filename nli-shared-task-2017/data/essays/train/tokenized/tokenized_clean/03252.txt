in my opinion , in the near future less cars will be used compared to what is used today .several reasons can contribute to having this opinion .i think the technological advances that are going on in othe transportation vehicles will decrease the number of cars being used .for example .trains in japan and germany are becoming very fast and i think in the futute they will compensate for the time it takes to reach to the train stations .goverments will announce new laws prohibiting a single person to use a car .already in certain cities , only cars with more than one passenger are allowed to use the fastest lane .this , to encourage people to travel in groups .the reasonable development of such laws is that statement mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph .home will be the center of all activities is another reason i would like to mention .nowadays , many people work at home .all the needed entertainment can become available at home .morever , food , from restaurants and grocery shops , is being delivered up to your door .car models are becoming very similar in appearance and options .a very good example is the honda accord and hyundi sonata , it is hard to differentiate between them form outside .at the end , this will lead to only one company selling cars .cars will have less appeal to rich people and they will stop buying cars and start buying hovercraft vehicles or any other transporation devices .in conclusion , cars will become dispensible as less cars will be in use .hopefully , instant travel , which we read about in science fiction novels , will be invented in the next twenty years .
