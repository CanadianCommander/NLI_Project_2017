to my mind , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first , there are a lot of advertisements which lie .for exemple , for products to wach white tee shirt , ads says  more white than white  , which is impossible .then , we discover there are a lot of liing advertisement when we try the product .when we buy a product to wash bath room , they do nt wash alone althoug advevertisement say .finaly , we find a lot of advertisements for only one product .he is always new , but there are the same ingredients .if we must nt be radical on this subject , we can say that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
