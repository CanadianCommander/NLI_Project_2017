i disagree about ` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in my opinion , if they fewer cars use in than there are today , that will call a lot of problems .first , they are young so they can make many possibles of problems with car than adults .of course they are not so young to drive but they are not adults eigher .for example they can make the drunk drive .they do nt think harder than adults so they think they drive with drunk .that was just one of possible situatuions .how do i know ?my friend s brother started drive when he was 20 years old .oneday , he drunk at noght with his friends .after drunk he drove the car .he thought he could dive .and he made accident .anyway that is one of example .second , when we start driving when we are 20 years old .they will more pollutions than before .and that can make more traffic jam . .so in conclusion , i do nt think they will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however they can use public transprotation for moveing .that was my personal opinion .
