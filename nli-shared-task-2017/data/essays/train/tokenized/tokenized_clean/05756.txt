i agree that it is impotant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the concepts and ideas are basic foundation and root . .how can trees are survival without their root ?one example , many korean students are good at math .some students practiced simple math questions repeatly without understandingof concepts .they reapeat and repeated on the same or simillar questions .they can get a good grades in elementary school .but in geometryl , students who did nt figure out of math ideas ca nt prove the solutions how it works .another example , i studied hard on math when i was in school .after 20 years later , the numbers which i studied have been just numbers .i have i do nt remerber .any thing .
