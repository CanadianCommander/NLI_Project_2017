the main problem with this statement is that its implications can not hold much factual value .it tries to generalize without taking into account the domain of function .different fields of knowledge require different approaches towards specialization in order to be effective .i will formulate what i mean by this shortly .in my opinion the statement does not hold much water as a general truth but rather depends on the context where it is used .there are certainly many fields of knowledge , where it is imperative to specialize extremly into a the subject at hand .modern science is a good example of that .the problem is the speed at which human knowledge expands .thanks to modern storing techniques and exponential growth of `` world knowledge  it is impossible for a human being to have a broad knowledge of different academic fields and still be effective to the maximum in a certain subjects .thus if you for example specialize in modern mathematics there will simply not enough time to dwell in the escapades of ancient , greek heroes .the main counter argument against specialisation is of course the lack of interdisciplinary thought , meaning a specialist does often fail to connect the findings of his field with discoveries of other fields .for example you might be a person with great interest into the functions and workings of the business field .you might want to become a first class manager and thus vigorously invest your time in the wonders of the economic sector .what if for example psychology discovers a way on how to better influence the opinions of people ?would these findings not help your agenda -- selling your product to your costumers ?but how would you know ?you never considered to connect the discoveries from one field with the findings in yours .thus molding parts of different academic fields into something better does indeed require a broader knowledge than just specializing .from a personal standpoint , meaning the effects two different alternatives of the statement would have on my personal development as a human being i would like to add :if my main goal is to life a healthy , fun , exciting life i do agree that it is more likely that a broad academic knowledge helps me in my everyday struggles more than pure specialisation .this is due to the concept of interaction and the fact that human thought does work a lot with association .this of course depends how much i am attracted to a certain field of knowledge .in conclusion the only true answer to the statement is : `` it depends  .its qualities as a general statement are certainly lacking .
