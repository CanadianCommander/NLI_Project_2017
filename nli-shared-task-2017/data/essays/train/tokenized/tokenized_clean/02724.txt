the university usually teaches the students to work hard .to read the appropriate books , to listen carefully , to make notes and finally to recollect the learned information in an exam or paper .but are the needed information only learned by conscious or are they understood and still available in our minds after the test ?if a course consists only of learning facts and figures , then for sure the students will forget pretty soon what it was about .but if they need to understand ideas and concepts they will be kept in mind once they ve been learned .despite the importance of understanding the information and concepts , in many courses it is still necessary to learn figures and facts to get a background knowledge about the topic .as long as the balance between learning and understanding is kept , there is no problem with it .but if the learning overwhelmes , the student might get bored of the stuff and demotivated .the risk of giving up is high then .moreover it is very important that a student can realize how to use the learned concepts in praxis .that point also stands for understanding ideas .but if the idea or concept is very complex and the student did nt get it right , he might stay behind and ca nt follow the course any longer .especially if the following builds on the known concept .in my opinion it is indeed more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because things i ve once understood i would nt forget again .moreover it gives me the feeling of success if i understand the way it works .for sure i also have to learn theoretical facts for my study but i think it s more important if i can use the facts i ve learned as a base for going further in understanding a concept .to sum up i would say that a combination of both , the understanding and the learning process is optimal for a successful study .
