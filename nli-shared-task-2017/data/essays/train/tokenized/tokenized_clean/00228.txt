i think that this statement is true .indeed , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they allready know how to do well .first , trying something new can only be positive .humans base their thoughts on their experience .however , if this experience is repetitive the lessons to learn from it are always the same ones .experience needs diversity to be usefull as situations that we come across in life are always different .doing something different from what we are used to can therefore be considered as an investment and every investment has risks and returns .for example , a painter who uses a new painting technique has more risks to fail in its tasks than if he sticks to his old technique .however , he will learn a new way to paint that will probably pay off one day .another angle for this question is human nature .indeed it is in human s nature to always take risks to improve .people improve their way of doing things by doing them more efficiently and success can be defined as achieving one s goal .people tend to perpetually improve .they find new ways to achieve their goals more efficiently .they are considered successfull by their peers .so trying new things and taking risk are in fact main factors of success .it is even truer today .in our society , everyone has to have the latest electronic gadget .so being new is actually becoming part of the definition of success .in a word , successfull people take risks and try new procedure to improve their way of doing things .
