nowadays people use cars for transportation so much .but this makes the rush traffic and stress in our life day by day .we have to find solutions to solve this traffic problems such as public transportations , airways and underground transportations .this solutions such cause the cars will be more less than there are today .first of all , in twenty years people want to avoid from the traffic problems .in fact , they dont want to be a part of a rush traffic because of not willing to be stressful .because of this they want to use public transportations such as buses , trains , metros , ships for transporting .so this will help them to avoid traffic and spare more time in their life .secondly the airways will cause the decrease in the number of cars in twenty years .in the future depending on a technological investments people will use airways instead of cars .because the airways provide us to transport more quickly than cars from one city to another city , also , from one continent to another continent .the other effects of airways in decrasing the number of cars are safety and comfortable travelling .people will wants to safer and more comfortable travelling in twenty years , so that , aircrafts will provide them to the people .the third reason of decrasing in the number of cars will be the underground transportations .airways are the fastest and the most comfortable way to transportation , however people can not use this type of transportation everytime .for example , when people need to travel in short distances they can only use helicopters as an airway which can be so expensive in short travel distances .but in this situation people will not need cars and public transportations also when they want to travel more quickly .i think in twenty years they will use underground transportation for short distance travelling .in contrast of using cars underground transportation provide them more quickly and safer transportation .in conclusion the car numbers decrease because of these three reasons .
