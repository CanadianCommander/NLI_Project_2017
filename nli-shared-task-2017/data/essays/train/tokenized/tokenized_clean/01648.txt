it is often said that percent of using cars will be decreased with in twenty years than now .some people might agree with this statement because they think that there will be new transfortation which will replace cars .however , i firmly believe that using car population will go up in the near future .this is because there are more people who want to buy a car due to develop economy and the tecnology of transper combience such as road will also develop .first of all , as far as i am concerned , a large number of people want to buy car because of breaktrough of economy .in other words , there will be more people who afford to pay buying car .it is commonly observed that economy became go up as time goes by .for example , in the past , there are a few people who can buy car because it is extreamly expensive to buy .however , as econmy have developed , many people can have atomobile .this is because , the cost of cars have been decreased and people richer relatively than before .therefore , i think that people who will have car will be increase .in addition , tecnology of transpertation infra will also develop with in twenty years .what i am trying to say is that it will be helful to people who want to use car .for instance , many infra s development such as high ways and local roads and solving the problems such as car accidents will give benefit to a great number of divers .so , from my persective , people who usually used other transfertation due to these problems will use more cars .finally , car drivers will soar .in conclusion , there are two main reasons why i think that using car population will incrase .it is not only because there will exist more rich people who can buy car owing to economy boom , but also technology which related wiht car industry will develop .
