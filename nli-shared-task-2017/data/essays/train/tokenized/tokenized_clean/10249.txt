for me , as i am one of the young people according to nowadays , i belive that we do give enough time helping our community .i would like to introduce our works for our community .in school we are asked to do voluntiering work for an exact amount of time .according to my knowledge i believe every school has the same amount of time to do voluntiering work .our school has to do more than 20 hours of voluntiering work for 3 years of junior-high school .this may feel that we are foreced to do it , but even though we are forced to do voluntiering , i say we eventually help out community .young people nowadays do nt only spend time helping their commintity but also spend alot amount of time helping their country .korea is a small country with no fossile fules or what so ever .the only resource that can help korea to keep on going to the top would be students or young people intelligence .a few days ago i found out that not even japanese students study as hard as we do .what i also knew was that korea s students had high grades in math and science than other country students .many adults are counting on young people to lead the country better than now .the result to this , many parents of korea s young people are making their children to work harder than any bodyelse .for example by sending their kids to after school academies and so on .according to my thought , i think young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities .although helping by voluntiering which is forced to do from school , i believe young people do realize they are helping out their community .for a small country without any natural resorce like korea , young people are studying harder than any other student in the world to eventually help thier country .
