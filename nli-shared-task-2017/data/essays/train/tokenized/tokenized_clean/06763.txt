i agree that successful people try to do new things and take risks rather than doing only one thing that they know well .first of all , i think that learning is a life-long job .every person who wants to succed has to learn new things very hard .i believe that having an open mind , trying to be adventurous and taking risks are the key to success .if i am afraid of change and do nt want to give it a try on new things , i will not be able to develop myself .for instance , say that i am afraid of water , so i avoid learning how to swim .i never try to learn so i do nt know how to swim .but one day , i was on a boat or a ship and the boat was on fire .or , i fell from the boat and i m in the middle of the sea , not being able to move .what will happen then ?i am a foreigner , good at my native language .but since i am good at what i already know and do nt learn foreign language such as english , i will not be able to study in the states nor communicate with people from abroad .i will be stuck in a little world .second , i think that people who resist to make changes become lazy and outdated .they do not develop nor improve themselves and just sit idle only doing what they know how to do well .i have seen many pople around me who become outdated and fall behind other people .for example , many korean people who came to the states do not know how to speak english .i was very shocked when i met some koreans , who lived in the us for more than 10 years , not being able to speak english well .the reason that they could nt speak was because they were comfortable with their life .they did nt want to try new things or learn a new language .nor do they wanted to take risks to adapt in the american society .they were just doing what was easy for them .they only hang out with koreans and watch korean tv shows , and do not know what is going around in the us .no self improvement nor development .all in all , people who sit idle and just do what they already know well will not be able to succeed .only the ones who try new things and learn consistently will flourish and succeed .if a person only does what he wants and does nt learn anything else but what he knows , the outdated person will not be able to succeed .
