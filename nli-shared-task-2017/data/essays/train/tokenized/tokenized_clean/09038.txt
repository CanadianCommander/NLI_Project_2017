cars are the major transportation in the modern society .in my opinion , there wo nt be fewer cars than there are today .people are getting more and more today so that they need more cars .also , people s lives condition are getting better .many family need more than one car .the techology is developping , people discover many type of energy sources for cars .many kinds of energy are cleaner than the regular gas .the cars  number is growing with the population .people are the heart of the society .the society moves for the people and the people move with the cars .in america , people would nt live without the cars .people are getting more and the cars have to be more too .it s easier to go around with car than the publish transportation .people have more money they will buy more cars .in america , alot of family have more than one cars , and futhermore some of them have three or four .people just do nt satisfy with just one car .it seems like how many cars or what kind of cars you have can show how rich you are .if they have extra money , they want to buy cars .the energy for the cars is much cleaner than before .in the modern society , the techology is always going so fast .in the past they think cars make the air very bad and in fact , they did .so people try so hard to find many type of different energy for the car .and they did it .no matter when , the cars will get more and more .they need them so bad and they wo nt get rid of them right away , maybe for 100 year
