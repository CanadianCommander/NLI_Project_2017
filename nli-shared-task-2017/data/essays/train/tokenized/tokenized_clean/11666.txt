throughtout my life i have always try to do the most to have great marks on all the courses i have ever took and all my experiences have showed me how important is to understant ideas and concepts while i am studing .that is why i agree with the statement .obviously , in an exam you are required to have some specific knowlegde about the topic , but to have good scores and to really understand the material it is more important to know how to connect the concepts and the ideas .the most important is to understand the main point , the main idea .since i began my political science university life i realised that it was not enough to memorize all the political conceps the teachers explained to me .it was not enough to memorize all the international regims or all the international agreements the countries had signed .i was required to say what the countries gain or lose in signing them and this agrrements affect them .furthermore , normaly those things that you are just memorized after you forget it so memorize concepts is just a lose of time .once upon a time , nearly four or five years ago a took an exam on the history course .the exam was about the second war .i always have been problems with the second war , the borders changes appears me so confusing so i was the whole week studing for this exams .in consequence i took great marks on that course .but two years after , i took a international european relations course and in the final exam i was required to explain the second war .what happened then ?i felt the exam because i had no dea about that conclict .that happened because four years ago i just had memorized the concepts and the facts without understanding them .in conclusion , through my experiences i have realised that it is more important for students and specially for me to understand ideas and concepts .
