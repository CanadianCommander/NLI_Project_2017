the first quote that comes to my mind when i read the statement is `` jack of all , master of none  .i do not support incomplete knowledge not only because of its non reliabilty , also because it is harmful to a certain extent .there has always been a difference in `` knowing  some things about many things and `` mastering  everything about something .a specialization on a specific subject matter not only enhances ones ability to excel in that field , but it also creates some great oppurtunities for the person to make a mark in his field .having a broad knowledge in more than one subject does not complete the any of the above purposes .the highest one can probably do is have a general talk about it and nothing more .but thats not one can do all his life !!!just talk a little about many things he knows .specialization is an achievement in itself .it not only gives the student a satisfaction of achievemnt but also a sense of pride to have gained the kind of knowledge he has always craved for .it gives us a kind of security within .a kind of peace .one becomes reliable on his most trusted knowledge on a certain subject .one begins to trust himself and becomes confident of his actions , and confidence is the architect of one s bright future .specialization does a lot more than just keeping one occupied proffesionally .it increases the knowledge base of a person and also makes the person crave for more knowledge in that area and in this way he outsmarts himself everyday .it makes ones life a challenge each day .it makes ones life more and more exciting !!!area of expertise is not just appreciated proffesionally but also in the long run it is appreciated as a gathered amount of information on a subject matter .it is not useful for the person alone but for the society , friends , family as well .and hence i believe in mastering in what one is passionate about than broad knowledge of wide range of subjects .
