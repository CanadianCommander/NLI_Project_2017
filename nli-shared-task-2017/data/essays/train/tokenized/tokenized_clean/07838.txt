nowadays , a lot of student go to university because their parents whants to , but it is not their desition .first of all , we can discuss the point what the sentence want to tell us with the words `` understand ideas and concepts  .undersand a chemestry fomule it will be problably hard .to understand a maths concept can be maybe easy .but student really care about understand ?i do not sure because the actuals student in hing school or secondary school just think at the moment and not for the problem they maybe can find in the future at university .on the second point we can discuss the second point in the subjet , it the `` leran facts  .that is clear to says that leran and memorise meanings or formules in any subject than to understand or maybe try to understand something .we problably do not understand it why ?i think it problably because we don-t really think about the future and just to the present , carpe diem , we problably need or try to understand too all of the formules or the meanings of all of the subjects .i think it will be easier for us to understand the ideas and concepts to help us to learn facts to us , because if we do not understand something we can really learn as good as we really understand .we maybe do not have the experience as an student in university , but at the end of the hing school we need to start thinking about this .i am disagree with this sentence because all of students now want to learn and they does not matter if they do not understand , they just want to know to do , for exemple a maths exercice for their exam to have a good grade , without thinking to the futur .
