maybe , but i am not sure .it s true that tecnologhy are growing very rapidly , but 20 years ago we said that today we could have cars with no pullution and that we cuold fly with them .i belive in our studies , and i am sure that something are changing .now we are looking at hydrogen like only solution for a pollution dicrease , but maybe tomorrow we can find something different .i think that the only way to have less cars in use is the introduction of a new tax to enter in the city and a good service of bus and train in the city .italin people are not able to reach the work place without their car and , i think a lot of people all over the world want their indipendent and to be free to go wherever they want .today we are about 5.000.000.000 people but in twenty years how many are we ?how many car will be ?if we grow up we need more transport and more car .now all the car are moved by gasoline , but is its price good and is its disponibility enought ?maybe only solution to cut the car number is the end of the gasoline or a price so high that nobody can buy it .some studies say that the gasoline price reach in italy on 2007 like a 1 , 80 euro for l , and if we think about mind salary it is easy to see how is difficult drive our car .however i think that will be very strange if in twenty years will be fewer cars in use but if we learn to go in 2 or more people with one car maybe could happen .
