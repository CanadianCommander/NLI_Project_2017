the statement says that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , in twenty years .however , i do not think that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .i have two reasons to support my opinion .first , cars are the most convenient vehicle we have ever had to move wherever we want to go .for example , most places on the earth can not be reached only by other means such as trains , airplanes , or by foot .i imagine that globalization will have spread more in twenty years , which means that people will move more actively than they do now .when pople move more actively , cars must be the most convenient tool to satisfy their desire to move .furthermore , if more cars are produced , the price of cars will decrease , which results in more people to be able to afford cars .when considering the world population will get enhanced in twenty years , i am convinced that more people will posses cars than now .thus , there is no chance to think about the decrease in the number of cars in use .secondly , there are hundreds of car manufacturers in the world .i do not think they will reduce their number of products , because their profit may decrease by doing so .manufacturers are good at marketing and catching consumers  needs in the first place .naturally so are car manufacturers .the world concern may be inclined to eco-friendly system in twenty years , but i am sure that car manufacturers will create those cars which match the needs of consumers and of the earth in twenty years as well as they do now .additionally , there have never been periods when the number of cars decreased so far .therefore , it is likely that this trend will continue , as long as car manufacturers desire to produce many cars under the support of appropriate marketing .in conclusion , because of these two reasons cited above , i disagree the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now today .
