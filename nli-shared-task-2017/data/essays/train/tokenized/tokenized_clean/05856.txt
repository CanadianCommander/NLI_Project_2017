i m not completly agree with this statement .it is quite general .for my opinion there are two kinds of students .for the first type is important understand ideas and concept and for the other type is important to learn fact .there isn  only this difference .exist two types of subjects .to understand the first type the student must be understand the main idea and the main concept , to understand the second type of subjects the students must learn facts .for example , for maths i must understand the idea and the concept to make an exercise but for italian lecterature i must learn fact to make an assignement .for my opinion there are a lot of subjects that are impossible to understand only with the facts but with understand ideas and fact and learn facts , toghether .in my personal experience i found subjects , i have needed to understand the main idea .for example to understand economy the students must understand tha main concept and must learn facts .there are concepts that importance and influence is really great and fot the students are most important to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts .i
