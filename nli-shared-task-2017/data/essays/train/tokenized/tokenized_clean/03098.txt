in japan , where i live , many people agree with the idea that cars will reduce in several decades .for the following reasons , however , i do disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .first , there will be no sufficient alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years .for example , sophiscated train systems can be alternatives for cars , but to construct such train systems in the whole world is impossible .i live in a rural area in japan , where there is no railway .since the number of population is not large and the cost perfomance of building railroads is not good , nobody plans to introduce a train system .there are many areas in the world such as my town in the world , where the number of population is raising rapidly .this population growth will result in an incereasing number of cars .this example strongly shows that there will be no alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years .second , cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future .for example , people often use cars to move heavy luggage .by the way , people tend to live longer , and the number of elder peple is increasing .the older a person gets , the weaker a person becomes .this means increasing elder people depends on more cars to move their heavy luggage , even in every day shopping .the number of elder people in my neighbour who harness cars to carry what they bought in a supermarket is actually increasing and keep utilizing them .this example definitely demonstrates that cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future .therefore , with the reasons and examples i mentioned above , i absolutely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .i believe that people will use cars in the future , but i wish more ecologic cars would be invented to not pollute the atomosphere of the earth any more .
