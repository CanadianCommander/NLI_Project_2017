i strongly agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .being a volunteer myself at the national university hospital for more than three years , i have sensed that the communities does need a lot of help from the general public .however , the young people involved in this project are extremely few .there are numerous reasons for this phenomenon .the first reason would be a lack of interest .we face a great difficulty to recruit people every year .they are simply attracted to other booths that are considered more interesting , such as outdoor activities club , dance society and rock climbing club .these activities involve a lot of physical movement and help them to bond better with their friends .they have a golden chance to know more about people from their age and build firmer friendship via such activities .helping the communities , on the other hand , usually requires the interaction with people outside the school .most of the time , they are from another age group .it is very difficult to get the young people interested or excited to talk with the elderly patients for two hours straight or to play with kids who hardly know any ` hot  music or movies .young people believe that they could hardly gain anything out of helping the communities .as a result , most of them are not interested .this also explains why ministry of education in singapore sets compulsory hours of community service for the junior college students .if not , young people would not set time aside for such activities .secondly , time contraint usually hinders the young people to helping their communities .young people nowadays are preoccupied with simply too many activities , such as school work , co-curriculum activities and other entertainment programs .in singapore universities , we have to attend lectures , laboratories , tutorials and seminars for almost 30 hours a week .during our spare time , we have numerous project meetings , assignments , essays and tests to prepare and study for .in our mere free time , we tend to relax by chatting on msn , surfing the internet , playing computer games , watching movies or joining club activities such as bridge club , skating club , outdoor activities club etc .this simply leaves us little time to help the communities .thirdly , young people , especially people from rich families , are not mature enough to face the reality in the communities .grown up in a wealthy family who live in condominiums or private houses , young people do not see the other side of the society .they do not recognize the existence of people who work 14 hours a day and earn a meager income , who live on public pensions of 200 dollars a month ( equivalent for the cost of their newly bought nike shoes ) , who live in a house without electricity and gas supply , who are sick but have no money to see a doctor and who are too weak to see the sun-rise on the next morning .helping their communities provides too cruel a reality for them to accept .as a result , they opt to escape from facing them completely .in conclusion , it is my stand that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .this may be due to their lack of interest , time constraints or their intention to escape from the cruel reality .
