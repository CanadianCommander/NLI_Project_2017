to express my opinion about this subject , i must say that , this statement is very unclear .i will agress with this statement , when the young people are living in an individual society .on the other hand , i will not agree with it , when the same segment of poeple are living in a collective society .our cultures are very different also our imagination of the morals .each culture has another family system funcionality .and as a result ; the attitude to the family will be the same like for the communities .for the explanition : the individual socity ; is this one who prefer that each member of the socity should have a near degree of the absoult freedom doing the things in that way , which he thinks it is the right one .the young people in this kind of society do nt give enough time helping their coummunities , especially the old people , for example i live here in germany and it normal to hear that somebody is found dead in his flat , - but firts six month after his death - .it means that nobody from his neighbourwood had noticed it at all ; that this man could nt be seen such long time .more and more , the young people are very busy with therselves .thy must achieve everything alone and for that , nobody else should participate with them even in their time .on the other side : there is another type of society , which called the collective one .in this one `` for example in arabic or asian countries  the young people stand beside to help their communities .it depend on the value of doing the things together .the acceptance that the members in such societies could do what they want to do , is not there .each member should do the same thing in the same situation , because they are acting and living together .at the end , i can say generally that the culture differences nowadys are going smaller in direction of an individual society .so that , i do agree that the young people more and more are tendencelly not giving enough time to help their communities .
