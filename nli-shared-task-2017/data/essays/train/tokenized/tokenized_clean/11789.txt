i think that what is stated in this question is correct .it is true that people who decide to specialize on a specific topic could perform in a particular field , allowing him to reach important goals in its professional life .on the other side a person who do not has a wide knowledge on different subjects , could face some problems in his daily life .a knowledge of different arguments could help someone to face a speach on multiple subjects showing its huge backgroung .i think that university shoud avoid to focus their couses on a limited number of subjects and allow students to choose among different couses .when i choose my univeristy cours i had the possibility choose a personal exam s plan .in that occasion i avoid to focalise my study plan on related subjects .even if it should be easier to study two similar exams , ( for example international marketing and international business )i preferred to base my plan on different subject in order to let me the possibility to analise the different subjects and tho choose , in a second time , the argument on which i prefers to focus .thanks to this method i ve been able to improve my knowledge on certains subject that i ignored before .this helped me in my post university environement letting me to chose a professional carrer not strcly related to the one i intendet to take at the beginning of my university cours .for these resons i think that a specialized knowledje could be interesting for someone who has strong passion on specific subjects , but it should be always supported with a wider knowledge in differents topics .
