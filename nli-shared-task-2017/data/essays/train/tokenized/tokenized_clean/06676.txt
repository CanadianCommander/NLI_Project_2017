i disagree with this statement .i believe that there is a better chance in having a successful career for a person when that person specializes in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic fields .as i write this essay , i would like to explain to the readers why specializing in a certain field is a good idea .eventhough it is important to have wide range of knowledges , it would be pointless if you do not know how to use them wisely .your knowledge from different fields could spread out all over the place and lead you to nothing .that is the last thing you would like it to happen .for example , learning different kinds of languages .you know basic greetings and could understand typical everyday conversations in five different languages might make you feel smart .however , you would not be able to do businness in those languages because you do not have enough knowledge of that language .in other words , you can not have a carreer using those knowledges .in conclusion , i would like to strongly state that to be specialized in one specific subject would help lead you to have a successful carreer .in other words , a brighter future .the more knowledge you have , the better .however , the important point here is how you are going to use that knowledge in your life .
