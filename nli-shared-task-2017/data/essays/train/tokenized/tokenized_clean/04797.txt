the statement that the young people do not give much time for helping their communities is a genaralised statement which has to be debated upon .i feel that the young person s tendency to help mainly depends on the kind of atmosphere he dwells in and the basic nurture that has been provided to him in his younger years .a person who has seen the difficulties of life in his young age is prone to actually understand the situation of the helpless .that empathy is the driving force for the youth to help people .we have seen many personalities all over the globe .some of them being mother theresa , hellen keller and mahathma gandhi .if we look deeply , it was their young days that facilated and ignited their minds to sacrifice their life for their community .this point rightly speaks for the youth .we saw a lot of protests and active participation from the youth right from the twin tower tragedy to the katrina .young people hae always been there for their communities in the point of distress .the other side of today s youth pictures students roaming around with guns and the rapid addictionof today s youth to drugs and other habits .empathy can surely not be expected from these youths .where there is no empathy there is no place for service .the young people today can not be catogarised on a general scale in this aspect .there are a lot of young people who take up their life s aim as service at the same time there are a lot of them who act in the opposite direction .furthur more , the increased terrorist attacks and the increasing hostility of the surroundinds serve as a catalyst to the youth of today to stand up for their communities .so i think that a sensible part of the youth is rightly giving its part for the community
