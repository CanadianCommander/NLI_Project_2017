travelling is a wonderful experience that everyone should access to once in a while .so why ruin it with a group of people you do not know and who do not have the same interests as you do ?why let a tour guide take you to only the most crowded places ?i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group , especially not led by a tour guide .let s start by saying that we are all different , and that while we may have some points in common with others , there is always an interest that is unique to us .therefore , imagine arriving to paris and joining a group of people that does not include just your family , but also ten unknown persons .how would you decide wether you all want to go and have a traditional `` pain au chocolat  with coffee or wether you are all going to go shopping ?or how would you decide if you are to all go to the highest level of the eiffel tower or just go up one level ?according to people s interests , it is impossible to do everything that everyone wants and you would be stopped from doing what you really want for the benefit of others .if you absolutely must travel in a group , i disagree on tour guides .of course , they can be helpful on specific information about the city s monuments .the problem is that they do not go at your rythm .for instance , if you are in new york and you wish to spend more time admiring the glittering times square at night , you may not be able to because the tour guide will have a precise timed schedule that he must stick to .i would therefore recommend buying a book with all the information about the specific city .this has two advantages : you are able to enjoy the city at your rythm and it s much cheaper !in all , i do not beleive that a group or a tour guide are the way to go when it comes to travelling because it brings too many restrictions to what should be a complete free pleasure moment in your life !
