the topic is whether in twenty years we will have fewer cars in use than they are today .i disagree to the topic and believe that twenty years from now we will have more cars in use than are present today .in last two decades the sales of cars has continuously shown upwar trend , right from small segment to large segment cars sales has increased and it is predicted that the trend will continue and so will be the increase in use of cars for coming decades .also urbanisation will play an important role in increased number of cars in use in next twenty years .because of urbanisation people are able to spend more and their buying capacity has increased .also it has led to development of big cities and towns where an individual has to travel a lot in any particular day .it will definitely lead to increase in number in use of cars as people will require a convenient mode for commutation .with globalisation and development being a part of today s world an increase in urban areas is inevitable and so will be the increase in number of cars in use .i think that twenty years from now with the increase in population and distances the public mode of commutation wont be so effective and people will look for much convenient mode that is cars .also with culture of `` i dont care  , people will not prefer public mode of transport as that will be more insecure and prone to accidents and thefts .instead they will choose their own vehicles probably cars to commute .with advancement in science and technology the efficiency of cars can be increased and in future we hope to have alternate and cheap fuel .this will definitely lead to increase in use of cars as operating expenses will come down for cars and people will try to have more cars for their convenience and as well as it will be a cheap mode of commutation .with extensive research we hope that we will have more environment friendly fuels and cars in market that will lead to increase in use of cars in next twenty years .also with increase in number of luxury cars and cars suited to varied tastes of people , i expect that people will go for more purchase of cars and this will result in increased in use of cars .with technology available to renovate the cars and make old cars look new with small investments , i think use of cars is going to increase in next twenty years .in all cheap fuel , better facilities , easy loan availability and convenience in transport will lead to increase in use of cars in twenty years .
