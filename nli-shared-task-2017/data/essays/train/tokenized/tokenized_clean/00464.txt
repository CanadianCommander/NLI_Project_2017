`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree and i desagree with this statement .first , i desagree because we can not generalise so quickly what young people do or not nowadays to helping their communities .instead , no everybody has the same difinition of `` young people  and furtherwards we have to make differences in `` young people  : some of them are very interesting in what happen in their communities and invest time in it and other young people do nt worry about it !second , i desagree because not only young people do not give enough time helping their communities , adults too .actually , i assume that young people are the most concerned with this problem but i will speak about this later .i agree for a large part with this statement .in my opinion , a lot of young people just do nt matter about what happen around them .they enjoy their life but they do nt think further than their own life in their little town !we have to inform people about their communities and encourage them to invest time to helping them !instead , you can do both being happy in your own life and having interest in the other members of your communities .and , in my point of view people do nt open their mind enough to the world .a lot of people thing about the best way to gain a lot of money and are very individual what i can understand too .but the world can not keep turnig if it is only an addition of individual people who do nt understand the importance of their communities .an individual person is nothing without communities around him .an other important point is that young people are the most concerned with this because they are the future members of our communities .but what is the best way to senbilise young people to spend time to helping their communities ?i think that could be a good subject for an other essay . ..
