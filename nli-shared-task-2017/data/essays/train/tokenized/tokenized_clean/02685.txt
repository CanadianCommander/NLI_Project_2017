i agree with this statement although it is really hard to imagine that there should be fewer cars in use in twenty years .during the last century the use of cars has namely grown enourmous , but i think that there will be a change soon beacuse cars are getting more and more expensive and people are earning less money .soon most people will not afford a car any longer .the first problem is that in our century of unemployment you can not spectaculate that people will get more wealthy during the next time .maybe even more people will get unemployed .a result of this is the second problem , the fiscus needs money to ensure that all of those unemployed people are able to survive .the fiscus  most likely opportunity to get money is to higher taxes and fees and because petrol is nothing you need to survive , the fiscus highers the petrol tax at first .petrol , which you need to use your car , is getting more expensive .the third problem is that our petrol-ressources are fading .in a few years there will be no more petrol to get and the prices for the last rests will explode .the result is that petrol is getting more and more expensive , but in a very fast and rabiate way !i know that there exist alternatives for driving with petrol , for example using bio-diesel , solar/energy or a hybrid motor .but these technologies have not still grown out and only few people can afford them .they can be further developed and they will be further developed , but this will need a lot of time ( more than twenty years ) .i think that in twenty years many people will have got rid of their cars and will not look after petrol alternatives but after car alternatives ( public traffic ) like busses , trams or trains .
