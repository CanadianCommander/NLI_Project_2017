the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.  is a faulse statement lacking evidence to support such an argument .the passage below will demonstrate , through three examples , how the above statement is inaccurate .firstly , if the population of the world continued to educate their children , or adults in many subjects then the world will have too many people that know a little bit about everything and none that know accuratley and condensly about specific subjects .if we take the case of jordan or saudi arabia , we find that the education system has proved to be less successful than that in the west , namely the a level , or igcse system .studies have shown that students tend to do badley when the education system includes many subjects .the english system for example , has proved quite successul .we find that students tend to choose subjects of interest , and tend to focus quite well and progress flourishingly at university since they focus all their efforts at subjects of interest and tend to excell .it has also been proven that if a student enjoys a subject such as math they tend to do considerably well , and may never excell in subjects they dislike due to the left part of their brain working better .studies have shown that the human brain is split into to categories , the more creative side , and the more mathematical side .it is upto the subjects to excell those parts of the brain more considerably .secondly , if indeed we broaden the knowledge of students into many subjects , we will find a lack in quality in nearly everything .if we take the following examples , we find that in disciplines such as architecture , urbanism , or even medicine ; a need for an accumulative time frame where constant knowledge is used to develop in such subjects .if an architect , did not spend an approximation of ten years learning and mastering the topic , then the work will be far less than perfect .ofcorse , it is always useful for one to learn more about other subjects generally , however it is important to relate them back to one discipline to actively excell in a particular topic .thirdly , we find that at postgraduate level , the reason the world is moving forward and excelling in terms of technology , science , and what have you , is due to researching specific topics at a higher level .a phd professor spends all his time focussing , and detailing a single topic for 3 to 11 years , and that is when the subject moves beyond it traditional scope .we also find that respectable institutions have continuously been re-inventing new topics of education such as human resourse education , and emotional intelligence .if we strived to learn all topics in their totality , then we would lack sufficient resources to keep expanding and creating new forms of education .in conclusion , we find that one needs to focus and free himself of external factors in order to succeed in life .as illustrated above the definition of success is the amount of knowledge one has gained in a particular topic to the degree where he has created and invented a new form of language to offer back to the world .if we all attempt to learn about many topics in general , then we will loose the devoted time to excell in just one .as mentioned , and supported in the examples above , the art to mastering a topic is to devote much time to perfecting the information up to the final elements .as the saying goes : `` god is in the detail  .
