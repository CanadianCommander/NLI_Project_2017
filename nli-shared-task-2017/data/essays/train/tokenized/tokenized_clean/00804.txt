you are active enough when you are young and this enables young ones to go for making enjoyment .the word ` enjoy  can be defined as the way by which people feel themselve happy and which gives a feeling of satisfaction .in my opinion there isnt any distinction for enjoyment because everybody is unique in there enjoyment .i am giving following reasons for holding this opinion .some young one takes enjoyment in doing crazy things .they feel that doing something crazy will give them enjoyment while other may look it as risky thing which will not give any kind of enjoyment .there is feeling of adrenaline rush which is enforced within the crazy performers , when they do some crazy things like making a jump from high altitude place , or making something different from the world .in case of elderly persons , their ways of enjoyment are diffrent they like to read novels , magzines or some religious literature .they will not perform any other physical activity .this does nt mean that they are enjoying less .their ways and views towards this phenomenon is different that the young ones .some may like to talk they may feel enjoyment in talking about memories of there time or talking about one of the friend of them .there are many number of ways to feell enjoyment and to make enjoyment .moreover today the most prominent problem of world is depression which people gets from their job work or any other stressfull comdition .so everybody tries to get relaxed from that and want to get some kind of feeling of rest .so they tries to grab every opportunity which they get for making an enjoyment .therefore you can observe many people doing some crazy things while othere simply watching them and stilla making enjoyment in their life .to conclude , there should not be any distinction between young and olderone about who enjoys more and who dont .everybody is having their ways of enjoyment for them .
