in twenty years , there is a possibilty that the amount of cars would decrease in comparison with today .since science and developement is moving on a fast pace , everything is bound to happen .technology is a big part of our lives .scientists could have been researching for a better for transportation .in twenty years , they could have found a more efficient way for traveling , other than cars .there must be a plan to decrease the amount of cars available on earth .traffic is taking it s toll on our daily lives .the streets are getting more and more crowded .in order to have fewer cars traveling around , there must be an invention done first .in twenty years , there could be more trains , as well as different types of trains too .there could be sky trains , and underground trains too .there also could be an underground transport system .it could resemble the one present today , but it would have to definetely be bigger with larger amounts of trains , buses , and probably a new invention too .pollution is a big topic today .by the time twenty years are passed , there would be a different concept of transportation available , and pollution would not be one of it s side effects .we have heard about the different types of possible alterations that could be done to present transporation systems .in twenty years , there would probably be a whole new aspect to these systems .in addition to those we have today , more planes , buses , and trains would be invented .each type of system could have a region or destrict to work in on it s own .the transportation systems would be more efficient .new gadgets and inventions would take over the ones we have today .there would be a whole new era , where cars would be of no interest .
