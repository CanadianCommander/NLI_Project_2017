today , the world has become a huge `` amusement park  for the young people .no one can denie the fact that the young generation is really enjoying their lives .nevertheless , did the elders hide in their rooms and never come out and have their own fun ?i believe the answer should be `` no  .all of us could not refuse to admit that the daytime indeed is the `` amusement park  for old people .it is not impossible to see parks fill with happy old people during the day while their children are at work .they can certainly enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air during daytime or sit down in a bench and chat with each other .there are no working troubles , no compitition , no anxious feeling about want to do about their own future .recently a research about satifaction of people s life have been made in my city and the result shows that among those who are 100 % satisfied more than half of them are over sixty years old .such as human nature , young people would take response for their parent and make sure they are happy about their life .in my community , it is really common to see a great many old people walking with their grand or great-grand children , smile on their face .and the movie ` on golden poud  did show the enjoyment of the elders with their own children .we have to accept the fact that being with their children is the most enjoyable thing to do .in conclusion , the old people could easily get protection from the society and their children while they do not need to face the matters anoying us every day , their life with grand children could not be happier .so i disagree with the saying that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
