i agree with the statement which is given , before .this means young people enjoy life more than older people .because the psychology of youth is based on senses , feelings .it doesn  t look over incidents , falls with completely rational and logical eye .if young people would weight with rational eye what they experiences have , they couldn not enjoy life so good more than older people .because they would see and understand realities of life , which are not so enjoyable .older people can look over realities of life with rational eye .because they have more experiences than younger people , and choose the rational way .their senses and feelings are not stronger their youths .we can see these situations at the oldest people in the most extreme fall .because they are closer to the door of the grab than others .and nothing can make them enjoy as before .opposing that sometimes we can meet young people which behave older than theirselves .this means , as exceptional , they move more rational , more logical and serious than their environments .therefore , they think future and behave according to future .they are little crazier but this does nt affect their lives to the negative route .hence , they can catch the succes .
