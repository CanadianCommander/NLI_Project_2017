transportation is a very importnat factor in today s global life .as the number of people increases on the earth , the requirement for different transportation ways increases as well .one of the very important means of transportation are cars .i will argue opposed to the statement that , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .firstly , the car industry is a very old industry , which is mainly developed through the last century .the improvements in the area are still very exciting , therefore the idea of earing higher and higher amount of money triggers more and more people to spend their money for constructing a bussiness on cars .as a result , car industry after twenty years will be greater and more important than today .moreover , cars are not attractive only for their being of a means of transportation .there exists a great number of funs , who can pay millions of dollars for old cars and special cars such as the last models of ferrarri .an other example is , the famous formula race , which helps to trigger a worldwide increase number of funs for using and buying cars .on the other hand , people choose to use their own cars rather than using means of public transport such as buses and metro , because they do not offer them a comfortable travel , which they can have in their private cars .in turn , the number of private cars increases in correlation with the increasing capacity for car industry , since everyday peolpe are introduced to this industry as customers .in conclusion , i believe that , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , due to the continuously improving car industry , which is in correlation with increasing number of funs of car races , collectors and customers .
