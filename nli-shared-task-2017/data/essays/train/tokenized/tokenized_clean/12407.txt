the statement is ambigous and could have more then one interpretation .what i do belive is that both of the tecnniques for learning are necessay for students to acquire enough knowledge in the field they are studying .a general way of studying is the basis for good learning skills .the understanding of ideas and concepts is important for the students because not only it gives them the opportunity to be interested in what they are studying and to learn more and more profound information on the topic , but it also allows the student to open his mind to new ideas and therefore have his own opinion on the topic he is studying .this is important for the lerning process because it gives more profound knowledge to the student and prepares him for debates and essays which might ask for his opinion or might ask him to sustain theories previously studied .on the other hand allowing the students to learn the fact is obviously necessary to achieve the understanding of the material studied .this is because without the basic facts of the topic the student might not be able to draw conjectures on the topic and might lack severe knowledge that would result important then in giving his own opinion , giving lectures and debating .for example a student that has to give a presentation infront of the class and has not only to show his fellow students what he learned from the various lessons but even how he uses the knowledge he owns to formulte his own hypothesis needs to know all the basic facts on the topic or his presentation might result full of conceptual holes and lacking important concepts that in the end would impair the student to construct his own opinion and to give a thorough presentation .in conclusion it can be said that the statement is right in the sense that understanding ideas is very important but is wrong in the sense that to achieve the understanding of several topics it ca nt lack the basic facts and materials or the understanding will be impossible for any student .
