some of the people think that successful people must have to try new things rather than only doing what that already know how to do well .in fact , people who want to try new things must have to bear the risks .however , without trying new things , things wo nt be improved or invented by themselves , and there will be no successful then .so i agree with this statement .in this essay , i will argue in favor of this statement and give some examples to support my opinions .firstly , if people never try new things , but only doing what they already know how to do well , they wo nt know that there s can be a change or improvement .since things wo nt be improved or invented by themselves , and without trying the new things , people are just like sitting at the same place or same level .thus , they wo nt be succeed .secondly , if people only doing what they already know how to do well , it wo nt bring out a change to improve the situation .since people are only repeating and repeating the same works that they used to do very well , there s no change in their lives .so , it s also believed that they wo nt be succeed since there s no change .lastly , although people who try new things need to take the risks , it helps to improve their works and lives effectively .with such an improvement , people have opportunity to be succeed and go to a higher level rather than staying at the same place and have no improvement or change .so people who try new things helps them to be succeed , in a conclusion , it s believed that successful people need to try new things and make their lives different .with such a differ , people will know there are something they can do to improve or change .so as to make their lives become better and more comfortable than before .
