travelling with a guide as a good influence for tourism is one of the major ways people use to enjoy their trips .my agreement is accounted to the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide .travelling to a foriegn countries or a well known countries is completely the same .in both cases enjoyment is sought .why we need a guide in our trip ?in my opinion the guide is more eligible to know the most rare and magnificint places which not well know even by local residents in that country .however , others may prefer tourism with out a guid for financial purpses .a lot of tourism seeker discovered laterly after their trips that they have spent more than they hould just because they did not hire an erudited guide to give them the pleasure they want along with a cheap prices .guider mostly never fruad on tourist unless unknown guide from unknown company was used .all the guider are respected and have a special care about their reputation .although , some of my friends said the guider are lazy in some places , they are very energetic in other places .some places need a special skills to go their .otherwise , life risk shell be considered .thus , guider usually are well trained face a posible danger and show the tourist the best way to see the place with a minimum risk .in additions , out side trips the one like in suburban or out side the city may expose the touror to a risk of being robbed .in this case guider usually have wireless devices to reported the accident and have the robber caought with out any danger or risk dealing with the situation .at last the pragmaticaly step people should do is to use assistance from tour guides when they need to make a trip .all the reasons i have mentioned are convinient to people used the tour guide before at most .few unsatisfied people are presented , but that does not meat we should travel alone with out any experience or knowledg about the places we intend to visit , the guid do .
