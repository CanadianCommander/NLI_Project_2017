these days less and less young people attend their community-meetings .and i storngly agree with the idea .young people who do not spend time to help their communities have some reasons .first , they do not know the importance their communities .although they depend their lives upon them , they do not notice the fact .because of it they think they do not have to wast their time to help their communities .second , there are a lot of much more attractive things than working for their communities around them .for example they want to spend their time to work for their part time jobs rather than to work for their communities .it is because of their benefits .that is , even if they work for their communities hard they can not get money .so they decide to spend their time more attractive thing .all in all , as i said above , nowadays they think they do nt want to spend thier time to help their communities .
