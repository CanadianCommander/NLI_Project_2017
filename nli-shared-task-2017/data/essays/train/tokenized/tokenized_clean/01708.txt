i am disagree .i see those advantages of travel with a group using a tour guide :- you do nt have to lost time in move from a place to other place ,- you can share your own experience with other people with the same objective ,- do nt get worry about get lost or be in dangerous places ,- do nt have troubles with the language ,- make your days easy , because somebody else is explaining what you have in front of your face .advantages about travel by yourself :- know people from the city ,- see more the village , walk next to the people , take the same air , eat the same food ,- tried to learn a language using some of their words ,- be a traveller where to learn their culture will be the first objective of your travel ,- ask where and how to know more about the city .i traveled as part of a group using a tour guide and was just a bad experience .you are so rigid to any wish or activity you would like to do by yourself , for example : when you are travelling with a group you have all the activities and the time depends of other person .there are travels organized by time where you only get a city go to touristic places and go back .you are travelling as as tourist .i will prefer always to travel as a traveller , that makes you more fun in your travel , you know more the city , the people , the culture and brief more the air of the city or place you are visiting .i was travelling a couple of time in rome , the first time was with myself , i took a guide then i was walking around the city and see all the touristic places and eat in italians small restaurants .thats was wonderful , i meet italians that then invited me to eat to their house to see an italian house , how they were living .with a group you will only listen some experience but not livinng those experience .i like to travel a lot and always i tried to travel with myself or not more to a friend in this way we can enjoy and share our opinions .only we need a backpack , camera and documents . ..oh and money will help a lot .
