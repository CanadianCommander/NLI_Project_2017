the question in hand is that do the advertisement make the products seem much better than they really are ?yes , i am completed agree with this statement .the advertisement influences the people in society .the advertisement introduces the product to the people with out giving the negative points about the product .people do not know about the product and they start using it without knowing the actual fact about it .for example vioxx was used by a lot of patient as a painkiller with out knowing the side affects of it .eventually , a lot of people die from heartattack .sometimes , the advertisement makes people passive in thinking about the alternative of any product .even the product is not the best in the market , people stop thinking about another competitive product .for example , a lot of people does not know about the the apple opearting system in coumputer , where as everybody knows about window operating system .even the apple opearting system is better than that of window , general public still believe that the window is the best operating syatem we have .the advertisement also serve the good purpose in the society .it is a good way of introducing the new product in the market .there are serveral products in the markets about them we do not come to know unless we hear the advertisement on television or see the product add on paper .even it introduces the launch of the new product to the people .ultimately , i beleive that the purpose of the advertisement is good in the society but company uses it to convince people to adopt their products by not telling the actual facts about their product .
