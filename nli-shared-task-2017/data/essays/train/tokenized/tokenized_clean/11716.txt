i disagree to this statement .in my opinion the younger people should be the ones giving up their time up to the communities that are having a hard time .younger people are more in to things but not in partisapating in supporting people .why ?i say because there is no benefit for themselves to collect .i think we should sponcer to the help-outers like handing them out drinks and bread .also the reason might be because they do nt really know how much those help - needed people are suffering .and for that i think it would be an awsome idea to set up an comercial for the people who do nt know the help needed peoples situation .or we can use the idea from my homeland , south korea .in my country students starting from middle school have to fill out hours contributing to others .middle school students from the first years to the second have to fill out the total of 60 hours .they do this by going to school that have students whose life is hard from their birth or by cleaning out areas that we all own like parks , picking trash from street and etc .i do nt think it s a bad idea by letting the students know how it is wonderful contributing to our city this way .although these 60 hours effect you from going high school i got to know the wonderfulness of contributing toour comunitiy like this .i am a middle school third year student right now and i assure you this is a great way to get young people stand up to this .at first at my first year i was stuborned about this with my other classmates because it is hard work .and i too , say at first i only ment to do this kind of stuff because it was required in my grades .what made me change my mined was one of the experiences i had .i signed up to go to one of the schools that have students ` not like us  .at first i was afraid of them .that thought changed when i was cleaning the windows .one of that school student came up to me saying hello in a weird way .but as hours past by i learned that that student was interested in being friends with me .i guess because they came up to me differnently i did nt really know at first .well , thats the case a me .i am hopping to open a volunteers club when i grow up , so i m hopping these ideas would work in the future .
