i partially agree with the statement that  most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .i think it is tough to clearly tell whether one absolutely agrees or disagrees .advertsements are one of the most important aspects of modern day business .with so much competition in every field and each idea superior to the other , good advertiment has become absolutely mandatory .advertisements help a lot in increasing the customer s awareness about a product .with so many products in the market these days , there is no way the manufacturers can reach the people without publicity .increased competetion can be cited as the most important reason behind an underlying exaggeration in all the ads today .if an advertisement is very modest , and explain the flaws as well the qualities , would there be any takers for the product ?people have so much choice these days , the manufacturers ca nt afford to loose their present customers .they are always trying to increase their market share .advertisements have a deep impact on the consumer s mind .he goes to the market looking for a particular product keeping the advertisement in his mind .it is only the beneficial aspects of the product that draw him there .an example could be that of luxury cars .all the ads emphasize on the increased space , better tyres , better suspension , etc .no one says any thing about the huge monthly installment that would go in to enjoy this luxury .but thinking from the consumer s point of view , he will not even go to have a look at the car if the ad is not attractive , leave apart buy it .but , on the flipside , there are many ads that are very misleading too .like , the ads for weight reduction methods .these manufacturers know that they have easy targets in women or young people in general .they publicize how someone lost a major chunk of his weight by consuming their pill .there is absolutely no mention of the side effects of these artificial methods on the body , which may look healthy after losing fat , but can develop other disorders , like reduced in fertility in females , to cite one .most of the time manufactureres know their target .they cash in on the weak points of that target population .sometimes these can misguide the people and lead to irreversible losses to them .by the time the truth dawns on them , its already too late to react .to conclude , i would say that taking one stand on any one of the two extremes is not fair .the maufactures should be allowed a little liberty in making claims as long as they are not absolutely unjust or too exaggerated .but they not let go of their ethical responsibities , and should not go to the extent of causing harm to their consumers just to increase their profits .
