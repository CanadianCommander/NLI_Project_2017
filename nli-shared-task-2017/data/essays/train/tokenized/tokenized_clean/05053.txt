where are you going grandpa ?shopping , golfing or maybe to a cruise on a yacht .that is what i usually get when i am really bored of studing or tired of endless working hours while my grandfather or even my father are getting ready to go on some sort of selfpleasing activity .i believe old people enjoy life more than youth or even teenagers do with all the study and work hours or the restrictions forced by parents .it is so hard for a young family member to enjoy life as much as elders do .as a begining , old people dont have any kind of study , midterms or finals to care about .they dont have to spend hours studing , going to school , attending classes or even buying books .they have alot of free time they can spend in any selfpleasing activity that brings happiness and joy to them .in addition to that most of old people do not have a job or a career to care about .most of them are either business owners or unemployed at all which is evern better they have nothing to distract them from having fun .not like young people who spends between forty and fifty hours each week at work .they have much more time to enjoy it .also , financial wise young people have alot of bills and payments .after school fees , rent and maybe car morgage their is not enough money left to spend for fun or enjoyment .most of the time elder people dont have these kind of concerns finaly , the limitations and restrictions forced by the family on their kids donot leave much space for fun .you are not supposed to go their or you are not allowed to be out that late , thats usually what a young member of the family gonna endup getting .not liek elder ones with total freedom .for all the spare time they have and the avilability of money or abscence of limitaions there is no dought older people enjoy life much more than youn ones do
