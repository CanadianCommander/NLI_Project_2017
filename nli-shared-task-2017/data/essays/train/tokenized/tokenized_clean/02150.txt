it is arguable that which is better to have broad knowledge of many academic fields or to have specific knowledge of one subject deeply .i agree that it is better to have broad areas of many academic subjects .in my case , i am studying international studies .international studies contains many areas such as international politics , international law , diplomacy , international political economy , peacekeeping , security , international organizations like the united nations and foreign policies of many countries .i should know these all of areas , even i can not know deeply .meanwhile some people believe that it is better to have specific knowledge in one subject insist knowing deeply in one subject is more important than knowing broadly , because if someone needs to master one area of studies , he/she should have backgrounds and history of this subject first , then start to absorb all chapter of this specific subject .in that someone can be said he/she is master of this subject .however , even people who believe that it is better to specialize in one specific suject , they should study outside areas of their subjects to need to understand their own subject easily .moreover , the knowledge becomes clear after touching broad areas .sometimes one or more theories can not be understood at once with these own theories .those must be dealt with other theories from different fields .basically , the most of studies are connected in similar areas , so it can not be considered and understood seperately .for instance , interior design , it is connected with arts and architectures .if interior designer does not aware the base of them subject , he/she can do his/her works .it means that designer should know about the colors and structures of buildings to achieve his/her works .to sum up , it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than specific knowledge , even it needs more deepen understanding sometime .
