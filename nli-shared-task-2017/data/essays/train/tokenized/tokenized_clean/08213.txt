some people have the idea that the social works are bored and annoying and for this stupid idea that the young people are not encourage to spend time in this mode .the most part of social worker are voulenteers and spend the ours free time to helping other person in economics or social problems .is a good thing to do beacuse before do that we ca nt immaginate how much is important for the society this kind of job .the young people see very far away this problem , like ca nt move or ca nt reach the post office , beacuse in this life moment they see more attractive the disco or go to the pub every night .i have many friends that partecipate to a helping communites and do nt spend so much time in this like bring dinner for homeless or prepare stuff for the african problem communities .luckly in the early years the idea is changed and more young people prefer to spend a little bit of their time in social work .specially before the italian governament as instuited the `` civil service  that provide to bring them into a social circle to help the communities than have few person .i dont think that all the people want to helping their communities but in some case there are a experience , sometime sadly sometimes funnyest but in all the case really helpfull .the most important work in this problem is do by the television and mass media than must bring at light this problem and encourage the young people to spend more time to help and less time to play , without compromise the career study , if they have one .
