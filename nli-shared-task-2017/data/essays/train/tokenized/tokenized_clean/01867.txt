because i am not an old person yet , also i do nt live with my granparents and i do nt have close person who is old , so i just can imagine how old people s life will be .or i could get informations from watching tv or reading books .to enjoy life , i think it should be only one thing to do .have friends !this is the most important thing people should do when they want to enjoy their lives .this dose nt matter either the person is young or old .so i disagree with the sentence .having a conversation with friends will make my life much more enjoyable .i always feel that ` friends  are my treasure .in other words , friends will be the key to enjoy life .when i be alone by myself , i need to enjoy just by myself which is very hard to do .if i am with my friends , i could laugh saying joke or having girls talk .also , i could reduse stress having a conversation or complaining about the problems i have .having less stress in life will make our life enjoyable , as well .therefore , i think we should have at least a little stress in our life to spend time more valuable .when we do nt have stress at all , we ca nt understand the people who had stress or we will waste time for not having a stress .but when we have to much stress , we ca nt focus on the things we should do or need to do .having a good meal will also make our life better .when people get hungery , especially me , we will get angry and wo nt have enough space in our feelings to enjoy something .for having a happy life , our stomache should be happy like us .having a hobby is important like others .i love to play soccer and i ve been playing for more than ten years-including few year when i did nt .this hobby makes me very happy and satisfied with the life i have .the most important thing of having a hobby is that we could be coneccted with others who has a same interest .i had many friends from the same soccer team , which makes my life enjoyable because of the first reason .maybe when i get old , it might be impossible to play soccer , but still i can talk about soccer with my friends !there is no reason that old people wo nt have an enjoyable life like youngers .we could have same great life if we try to enjoy ourselves .i think the people who are not enjoying their lives are not trying to enjoy .i am enjoying my life-following the reason i think i should do to
