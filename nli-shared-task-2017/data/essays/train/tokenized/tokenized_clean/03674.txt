it is widely considered as a fact that the number of cars in use will decline during the next twenty years .but this theory is only true for the developed world and not for the world as a whole .it will be pointed out in the course of this essay why this is true for the developed world and - more important - why the total number of cars in use on this planet will continue to rise .at first , the question arises why people tend to think that the number of cars in use will decline during the next twenty years .as the people and especially the politicians in the developed world tend to give more importance to environmental issues , it becomes obvious that cars account for heavy air pollution .therefore , mass transportation systems as trains or buses are likely to be able to attract more customers than they are now .additionally , it is likely that those mass transportation systems will receive more financial aid from the government making them more attractive for the customers .as a result of that development , people living in those developed countries will need less cars .but nevertheless , the amount of cars in use in the world as a whole will continue to rise .new concepts and developments in the field of energy are currently developed by car manufacturers all over the world and they will make petroleum-based fuel obsolete .some new cars as the toyota prius already use some of the new concepts .the last and maybe most significant argument for the theory of an increasing number of cars is the on-going process of globalisation which results in a higher level of development in countries as china , india , brasil or indonesia .today , most inhabitants of those countries can not afford buying a car .as those people get more money out of their job as a result of globalisation , they will develop the same needs which people of developed countries have today - driving into the countryside , visit friends in other cities , making holidays , etc .and due to their increasing income , they will soon be able to buy cars .as the number of inhabitants in those developing countries is enormous ( more than 2bn people in china and india combined ) , the number of cars in use is likely to rise .to conclude this argumentation , it is highly unlikely for the numbers of cars in use to decline .especially the growing demand for cars in the developing countries as china and india will bring the number of cars in use to a new record level .
