in our western society , where the individual plays a center role , the community appears to be less and less important , although it isthere is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays .that of a group of idle and lazy people , who play video games and watch talk shows on television .this sounds like a cliche , but in fact is what a great majority of people tend to believe .this common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the medias which are supposed to reflect young people  s expectations and values .for instance , if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is mtv we see a disabused youth , who does nt have any ideals and does nt give enough time to helping their communities .this widespread view needs to be confronted to reality and facts .i believe that we shouldn  t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities .some help younger children with their homework , while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplished anymore .indeed a lot of associations exist .young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community .external factors explain that .one of them is education .when raising their children , a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion .in this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others .they are self absorb and selfish , thinking about their own confort .it is also the government  s role to educate young people .it would be interesting to set up special programs in high schools so as to create an interest .stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial .
