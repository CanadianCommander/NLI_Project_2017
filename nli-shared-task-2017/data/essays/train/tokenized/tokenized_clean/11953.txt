nowadays the lack of help by young people is a big problem of our society or community .the help does often lack concerning older people but even in politics or sport clubs .in every part of our society , youth try to refuse their responsibility so they can use their time to play video games and other unimportant things .a good example is the work at social associations .it would be a good idea to let youths do an internship there or something like this , so that they can learn to treat with responsibility .this would be a benefit for themselves and for society since a lot of costs for staff could be saved in the associations .the work with old people or people who need help , like disabled people can also have a good affect to their personalities .another good aspect is the lack of help concerning politics .as seen in every recent election , the participation in the elections has still decreased .of course this can also be a fact of older people who do not go to the elections but it is actually evident , that the biggest part results from the lack of interest in politics of the adolescence .it would be a big support for the cities , villages and towns , if younger people expressed more interest in politics and help their communities at the same time with election campaigns for example .with such supporting people a lot of costs can be saved even here , in the political sector .furthermore , there is another part of community , which is affected by the lack of help by young people , namely sports clubs .in the past there had ever been people that just lived for their regional sports club , no matter which kind of sports .the did everything for this club .and indeed it is the community and the help of a lot of people which makes such a sports club to a club that functions pretty well and brings a lot of fun .nowadays young people just want to go there and to do there kind of sports .and after that , they want to leave .they do not want to be confronted with any responsibility , which could require a little bit of trouble .something like club parties in such sport clubs presents a good example .most times , those are organized with the help of all club members and those members are the people who bring the beverages , the cakes and whatever .but today it is already too much for a young club members to bring something for the community , like a cake , or to give their friends a couple of hours of their time to help at the club party .conclusionally , in my opinion , young people should absolutely give more time to help their communities , since it is not only the community , that benefits from that , but even themselves and their personalities .
