there is no denying the fact that it is important for students to learn facts .however , i personally think that understanding ideas and concepts is much better for me .i can imagine that for some people facts are crucial in human life , but i think something else is better for me .facts are basic in the sense that they are stable matters and people can benefit from them .to illustrate , history is full of facts that a major part of people in the globe benefited and will benefit from .however , learning facts has some drawbacks .for me , facts do not encorage students to use their creation or imagination and ability to agree or disagree with something .actually , there is no mental activities behind learning facts or expressing new capabilities that students are endowed with .on the other hand , understanding ideas is much more crucial for me .understanding ideas makes me use my mind , imagination and mental capabilities .besides , it is an efficient way for student to talk and have a discussion based on an idea or concept .for instance , students may talk about an idea by a writer like the americcan bernard lewis in his book what went wrong ? .they may for exemple tackle the idea of islam and modernity or the difference between jihad as a part of militancy and resistence and the concept of terrorism as a terrifying matter .another exemple could be the clash between civilisations and how people came to hate each other through politicians .furthermore , bernard lewisthe counterpart edward said with his book orientalism conveys more tention between nations .for me , students shouldknow about current and previous ideas and concepts to be able to be up to the level of the developments of events in the world .as a conclusion , i really think that understanding ideas is better than learning facts .therefore , i agree with the statement that says it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
