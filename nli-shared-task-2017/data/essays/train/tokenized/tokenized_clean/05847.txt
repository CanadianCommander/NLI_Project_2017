helping the communities is a current problem .there are more and more people need help in our communities .but we are living in an age with less attention and concern for the community versus an increased for one s owns needs and pleasures .in fact , there are more old people .the human body seems to be more resistant than before .medicine are more elaborate .some of them live alone far away or near their family .some of them can not be award over the new technologic .so they need help , sometimes only for speaking and walking .besides there exist unalfabetic people yet .i have heard that one by ten people in belgium is unalfabetic , it s enormous .these people need help too .there exist associations .finally , something is very important for me and communities is the respect .if everybody respects each other a lot of problems in our communities will disappear .respect between student and teacher , police and citzens , with authorities , ...with doing i think that it s a big step for communities .it s not difficult and i would add that s a basic thing .here you are a lot of things that you can do to helping your communities .you can notice that i said ` you can do  without specified who s you .in fact , i agree with this statement .but i would clarify that it s a problem for anybody who live in a community , not only for young people but also for adults .
