in this text i will discuss the question `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .at first i have to say that everybody will be old at one day and this is my first argument .when young people think `` i will be old sometime  they often think on `` but not yet and i have anough time to enjoy my life !.then the young people often do something forbiddin or something `` freaky  .for example i read about parcour .parcour means that you run accros a city and always run straight on even if there are cars , garages and houses .you just climb up the wall and than jump down and that is what many young people do .for older people enjoying life is often spending time with the family , go traviling and reading something in what they are intrested .for example can not everybody remebres his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would have never allowed or something like that ?and most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels ?older people most just enjoy their life .but the young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that .so the real question is who actually can enjoy his life ?but this would take to long so i will write my oppinion on the question `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  i think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .i think that , because i often hear storys about oler people beeing very ill or having pain everywhere and like this you ca nt enjoy life .young people often do forbidden things and that gives them a kick and the thing with girlfriends is although giving young peoples a feeling of enjoying their life .so i think young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
