the advertisement world sometimes is bigger than the cuality of the products .i have to agree with the statement because the world now a days is based on consuming and selling as much as possiible .fisrt everything comes first right in to the human eye , what looks atractive , new and original is always an eye catcher , and this has been proved , even i am a victim of those atractive things , is something comun and usual to find .as examples we have coca cola and pepsi , is obvious they compit with each other and sometimes roughly , it is really a war .and here is easy to read a great advertisment campaingsecond , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advances poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition has grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and as long as it sails is fine for any company who needs advertising .is has been seen in the aspects of beauty , advertisemtn controls the worlds thoughts and minds , because of the amoo8ount and constant information they send , as an exapmle abercrombie has this message of sexy and the the sailers are all good looking and grat bodys .and evidentiially all kind of people wanting this things go and buy there , is theyr way of sailing .third because the people are been bombarded constantly by propaganda , now is not a competition betwen products is betwen the best advertising .so now the companys have to figure out how to catch the eye of at least one person , and sicceed with the porpouse states at the propaganda .but what became a tool , now created a silent war between products and companys that are competion .the best advertising wins ; but this leaves sometimes a side the cuality of the products , in many occations we can find that you buy something because of the exterior nad it ends up been junk or a disaster or just what you were not expecting .as an example i bought a drink nad it looked good , delicious but the taste was extremely sweet nad gave a head ache .so in conclution even a fantastci advertisment can be junk or not really what they are selling .
