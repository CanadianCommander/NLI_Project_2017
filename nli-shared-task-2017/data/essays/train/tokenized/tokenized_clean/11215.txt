i definitely agree with this statement .i really believe understanding ideas and concepts for students be more important and valuable than just learning facts .there are diverse reasons supporting this opinion .first , ideas and concepts are abstract and general , in fact they generalize facts .this means that studying either a concept or an idea you learn the outstanding which all that kind of facts are based on .in other words you study a multiple set of facts .besides once you become familiar with the concept , you can apply it in several ways and field of real life .on the other hand learning a fact you just learn that fact which is different to all the other facts .another important constatation regards how long a student can keep in mind a fact or a concept .once you ve understood a concept , it is difficult to totally forget it or delete it completely from your knowledge .differently a fact is absolute easy to lose even in the short term , because it is an unique , isolated situation .you can apply this statement especially to subjects like mathematics or finace in which you have to learn how to derive formulas or values rather than remember all the possible ones .so even you dot remmber that formula you can derive it through passages that you understood
