i am deeply sorry to have to disagree with the statement , specially because my idea of a better world includes the reduction of private transportation in benefit of public transportation .the truth is that i do nt see that happening anytime soon. : ( let s do the maths >first of all , the degree of development that countries like china , india and others are achieving , will bring access to a huge portion of their citizens to private transportation .even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of cars that is currently using , that would make the difference .so we can add some hundred of millions to the current number of cars . ..in the meanwhile , the population in developed countries keeps growing , what lead us to discard the idea of a possible reduction of vehicles on these developed countries .so we keep adding some millions . .the results of the research of alternative sources of energy , if possitive , will probably boost the car sales in the future .yes , we can still consider them  cars  even when they do nt run on gas anymore .at that point , having a car will probably make more sense than ever .the idea of making 500 miles for only 2 dollars sounds definitely very appealing .ttraffic jams could be the only reason to use public transportation by then .our cities will become more and more overpopulated and hard to move through , proving the use of public transportation as the most effective way to move around .yes , that probably will happen , but still we will probably like to have our own car in the garage to use it during the weekends .we wo nt resign to that feeling of independece and of course the rest of member of our family wo nt do as well .so my opinion is that the reduction in that respect wont be very significative .all that said , my opinion is that the number of cars in 20 years will be higher than is now .
