some people might think that successful people try to new things whereas others might believe that they should do well what they already know for the success .in my opinion , i can agree with the statement only if the success people already do well what they already know .one possible reason is that doing easy things can reduce the risk of failing to do new things .if small problems that can be easily coped with are left for long time , it will be the interraption of the succession .even tiny problems can be bigger when they are left over for a long period .if the basic has been done , the successed new thing will yield more benefits .even if there were small things which were easy to be done , they would results the liability .to success , the things that are basic and have known already sould be well done .it decreases the risk of the failure , and the new things that are tried will increase the benefit from the succession .if only new things are tried from no background , that will yield nothing and cost .
