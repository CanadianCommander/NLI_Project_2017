it is intresting weather we look for idea and concept than facts .i belive that emphasising on the facts is good rather than ideas and concepts .so , i disagree with the above statement .ideas and concepts were formulated by philosophers or scientsts where made questions on the facts .for example scientists belive that earth was large flat surface .untill one of the scientist while travelling on the ocean recognised that earth is not a flat surface because the the fact that oceance is appearing like endless and movent of steasmers proved the fact that earth is in shape of the globe .so , ideas and concepts are not always true .facts are what we observe and these werwe stone of development .for example invention of chicken pox vaccination by the edwarrd genner , he discoved the vaccine by observing that persons working with milk products were not affected by the perticular organism besause of the fact that they were ressistant to that organism .another best example is the health profession of physiotherapy which sounds good for the facts . .the studens and physiotherapists stongly belive the `` evidenced based clinical practice  .evedence based practce .treating the patiens with the best available stratages and protocols stated and proved by the students and physiotherapists .in coclusion , the students will more benifited when they learn the rel facts .
