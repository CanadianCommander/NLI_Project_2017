the question i want to discuss about is whether young people enjoy life more than older people .this questions plays a not unimportant role , since the average age of especially western communities chang dramatically and today s young people are more and more drawn into the corner of a fun - generation .but what is meant by enjoying live ?people of different age groups have different definitions of enyoing life .young people are constantly facing more problems about their personal future especially concerning money .since a lot of young people ca nt be no longer sure to have a secure working place , many young people try to push this problem aside , by covering the left spot with activities that might distract their view off the actual problems they have .so they often lose the focus on how to solve their problems by positioning themselves in a world , where everything is about fun and joy .at first , this might work , until the person realizes , that fun and joy can not happen without money .at this point young people can go in two different directions .the first group may focus back and concentrate how to get back on track while the other group might be trapped in a vicious cyrcle of wanting to enjoy one s life , but having no money to do so and also not beeing able to get any money the legal way .older people on the other hand are more experienced and since almost everybody of them , especially here in germany , is affected by world war ii , they value the things they posess more than a person who has not gone through anything comparable .but if an older person can enjoy life or not , depends on his or her possibilities to do so .illness or death of one s partner might easyly avoid to enjoy life .but even if you are healthy and have a working partnership , you still need money to fulfill your dreams and to enjoy life for instance by travelling different places in the world , buy your favourite tv , etc . ..and that is the point where the arguments about young people and old people come together .i think , that you ca nt finally say that young people enjoy life more than older people .to enjoy life you need to create a basis which allows you do develop your personality and your self-actualization and this does not depend on whether you are old or young .
