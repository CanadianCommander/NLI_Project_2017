advertisements are very important influence and useful in our life in many subjects .from this i agree with the following statement ( most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are ) .as i said advertisements are important in improving the selling of a product .without advertisements people do not know or hear about product unless they have tried it , so advertisements show people a product , make them aware of it , and make the product familiar to them .let us take an example about an example of an advertisement of a specific car wher a beautiful girl or a celebrity is riding it and racing a lion and beat him , that advertisement will increase the selling of that car .otherwise advertisements are not always honest about every qualities of a product .either way , advertisements make prouducts seem much better than they really are .advertisements expand the popularity of a product and make it very common and adorable , because of the picture and the show that present .they provide the best pictures of a product and hide the worst .everyone is interesting in advertisements , follows and watch them to see what are new and good and cheap , and after that go buy the product .in the reality the product will differ from what is in the advertisment , because the advertisement makes it the best and does not have any mistakes .in this situation you can not blame the advertisements because their work is to make products seem much better than they really are .
