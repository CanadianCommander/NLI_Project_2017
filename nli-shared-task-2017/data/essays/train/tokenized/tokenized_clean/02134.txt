now adays , technology plays main role in our lifes , as it facilitates communication through out the whole world .some of the aspects of these technology may now be considered normal , but few years ago it would have been thought of as magic ; two or three centuries ago cars would have been though of as mericales and not common as these days .i guess that we have to consider this rapid changes in technology , before judging the next twenty years .i think that in the next few years ; man will discover a better and less dangour way to transport ; he will notice how polluting these cars are , and that they already have damaged most of the earth s atmosphere , then he will invent something new that will replace the car existance in our streets , and i imagine that the main issue of the era will be how to save the earth from the damages that happened through the last centuries .he will also find faster means , that he will find it to be more convinient than cars , and this is expected as cars will not be enough to supply his needs in fast transportation .some people might consider the whole issue as imaginary subbject and that its impossible to make such a change in few years , but lets look at car history .cars were invented and became in use in less than ten years ; lots of companies were racing to produce it in several shapes and with distincit facilites .as example ford company was convinced with the idea , that cars can replace all the existing methods of transportation , and have a primary role in the market , so they made great production that the owner was said to be mad , but it came up that he was right , and the whole product was sold and the compnay became a major one .looking through out the history will make us see it clear that no technology , no matter how large or common , will last , so i guess that this is an enough reason to think that cars will disappear in the next twenty years .
