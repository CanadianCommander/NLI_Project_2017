today , we depend on cars .there are a lot of cars on the road in holidays , and the news about traffic jam is always on the screen of the tv .however , i do not think this situation will continue .i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .i will explain my reasons .for the first reason , the public transportaion will deverop .if it will develop , people will not use their cars any more .here is the example of its developing .the railload is developping now .in my country , it is decided to expand it .if there is new railload , we can go almost anywhere in my country .another example of developing is about cost .the technique of today will help that the public transportation can move with fewer fuels , so the cost will reduce .i think the development of it will be great help .i will explain the second reason .that is about fuels .nowadays , the problem of fuels is crucial for us , because we totally depend on them .that is because we must save fuels .however , cars which use electric energy instead of gasolines are not still invented .the experiment can not say effective suggestion .that is why i think the cars will dissapear .the third reason is growing up of the idea of health .living for a long time is the major concern thoughout history .to be more healthy , people need to walk .in our country , walking is hot now .there are a lot of tv programs about health , and they suggest walking .tv has so much power that tv can sometimes control the minds of people .if tv makes walking hot in the world , there are few cases people use cars .in conclusion , i think people will use fewer cars than people use now .that is because they use public transportaion more , because they would like to save the resources of the earth , and because of walking .i think the day comes when we must become independent of cars .
