some might argue that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding facts .i think this statement can be true in some way , but i definitely reject it and for the following reasons .although it is easy to support the theory that students tend to be fascinated by and thus learn ideas better than facts and give them more importance , this can be argueable .literature or philosophy , which are basically based on the study of ideas , ideologies , theories , are usually easier to study and even more pleasant than , for example , solving chemical forms .they imply less effort and abstract concepts can be seen as more essential in an education than numbers or facts .however , subjects as literature , philosophy , history , can be on one side as difficult as scientific subjects and on the other side often have to be supported by facts .firstly , ideas , for the reason that their substance is based on abstraction , can be very hard to formulate , share and understand .many philosophies , like kantism , are based on notions of knowledge that are mainly intuitional and can not be understood neither by an experienced and open mind , thus it can be hard to consider more solid and important than facts .secondly , facts are ideas and viceversa .as popper stated , facts do not exist before ideas because it is the idea that brings the mind to explore the fact .also , many ideas have to be supported by numbers to be valid and feasible , i.e. economic theories or political statements usually rely on statistical data and methods .in conclusion , i would say that the statement is a half truth and could be completed saying that ideas and facts are essential elements in every mindset in any study area , depending on each other and sharing the same importance .students are usally enough flexible to appreciate both ideas and facts , as many old thinkers and philosophers , who were at the same time mathematics and philosophy scholars .
