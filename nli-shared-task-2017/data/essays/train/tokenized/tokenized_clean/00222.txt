there are a lot of people that think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one .in my opnion , the problem with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that the person can not have a strong and deep knowledge of each one of them because he or she will have practically unlimited sources of study , and this will derive in knowing just a few things or very superficial facts of each subject .i realize , though that there are people that study a lot of academic subjects because they are trully interested in them , and only for their pleasure , in that case i admire them for having so many different interests .in my personal case i found that specializing was a much better thing to do .for example , i am a physician and the subject of medicine is absolutly huge , so when i finished the medicine school i decided to be a specialist in neurology .when i got into my speciality i realized again that it was practically imposible to have a very strong knowledge about all the field of neurology , first because it is a very vast part of the medicine , and second because it is changing practically in a daily basis , and being current with all the information is a quite difficult task .thus , i decided to sub specialized in neuro-oncoly in order to be able to have a very strong and deep knowledge of the subject , even though it is a very specific one .in summary , i know that there are people that prefer to study many different subjects , that could work very well for them but it does nt work for me .i think that it is better having a strong knowledge at least in one field and not superficial knowledge in a lot of subjects .
