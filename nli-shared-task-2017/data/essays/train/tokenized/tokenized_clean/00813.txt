if we talking about advertisements of goods/products the first thing to do is to know what the producer or the seller wants to reach .he wants to sell his products , and he will do everything to reach his porpouse .advertisement is one of method say to the customers `` here i m ...and this is my product  .who sell products using advertisement trying to show its own product much better than they really are .doing that , they , the seller , try to attract the consumer , showing the best side of the products .in particular trhere are two elementse most important than the other used in an advetisement : price and quality of goods .who work in the advertising field know how to advertisement a product .for example using comparative advertisement method : say to the costumers that theyr products are different by the others .another method is to say to the consumer that his/her life is not complete without this or that or surely will be better .my opinion is that advertisements is based on knowledgement of social and human science .that is , knowing what the major part of persons will think looking a good in a particular light or a particular color can be obtain his goal .we know human want what they immagine or wish .if the seller is able to advertisement his product in the way that the consumer want is target is reached .may be before to buy something , it will be better if everybody ask to ourself is what i m going to buy is like i see in the real and not what it seems in my mind .i that my opinion !
