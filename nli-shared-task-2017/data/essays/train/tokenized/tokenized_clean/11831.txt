the invention of the vehicle is one of the most significant achivement of the twentieth century .they made the long distances shorter and provided time efficiency .today , cars are the most common kinds of vehicles .every individual might buy a car depending on their needs. t must be stated that selling rate of cars are getting increased due to the curiousity of people , the advancements on cars and the population growth of the earth .therefore , while there are technology improvements on cars and rapid population spead over , i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .to begin with , the technology is reaching further in any area and the area related to cars , so i do not think that in near future there will be fewer cars in use .the technology improves cars far beyond .every year we are being advertised about new things on cars such as brake systems and some protections for children .for example twenty five years ago there have not been an abs ( automatic brake system ) system but now we have that technology .i personally had chance to experience this sytem in our own car .one day i was driving car and suddenly a child appeared , i quickly pushed to the brake and thans to the abs system i did not hit to child .consequently i do believe that while the advancements on cars continue , it is low possibility that in near future there will be less cars in use .in addition , the population of the world is increasing every single one of day , so i see this factor as one of the reasons not to decrease the amount of cars in use in near future .accordingly population growth is a problem that must be solved .there are starving people in afica .so i do believe that it is not good because the resources are limited .on the other hand , it is good for selling new cars .because every individual means potential customer .so looking in this perspective while human beings are increasing and spreading all over the world , it is not possible that the amount of the cars reduce .for example researches show that , comparing the car selling rates with the past thirty years it is consistently increasing every year .in conclusion , in the light of the facts i stated above , i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i consider there might be people who agree with that statement .however in my opnion my reasons are crucial and essential for me .therefore in my opinion in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there today .
