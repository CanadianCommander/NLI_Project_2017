the popular products have seem great invents for people but this is not enough to be succed .people should not believe advertisements because they can not tell us they are true .and also people want more than beaty so they want to see and they want to try them .sometimes we buy something but we do not think how it will work .because we just look it s beaty .then we come our home and try it .when we try it we see it does nt work well .in fact , we start to tell other people it does not work so we get advertiser .when we think about advertisements we should be carefull because we do not watch advirtesements only in television or we do not listen them only in radio .a person is more important than television or radio .if the person start to influence somebody you can not stop it .finally , every body hear it .if there is a bad firm which one uses advertisements to sell much better , it can be succed first of all .but in the socond time people will not prefer it .advertisers do not see that they can not be successfull if they do not advertise good thing .most of advertisers use same way .they think they can control our minds easly with their advertisements .we watch or listen a lot of different products but the result is same .if you ask which one is better this one or other one you can not choose easly with advertisements beacause they say us all of them is better .i do not believe advertisements to buy something .
