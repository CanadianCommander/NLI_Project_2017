i strongly agree with this statement .this is for various reasons : first , the mere learning of facts is boring to most people , thus leading to lack of motivation and concentration .understanding the underlying ideas and concepts on the other hand is more interesting to most students .plus , once they have understood a certain concept they often feel proud of themselves which gives motivation for further learning .moreover , once a student has developed an understanding for the basic ideas of a certain issue , they are not likely to forget what they have learned as fast as they would had they only memorized facts .plus , students who have an understanding of the matter can answer questions more easily , and are even able to answer questions that go beyond the mere facts .thus , from a didactic point of view , understanding ideas and concepts is far superior to learning facts .now let me give you some examples supporting the statements which i have made above .let us take a look at the physics of a flying ball .students can either just memorize the formulas or try to understand why the ball is moving the way it is .simply learning the formulas is not interesting at all as they consist of only letters and numbers .it is easy to forget that the x was squared or that what a certain letter meant .on the other hand , trying to understand the cause of the movement is a much better idea .students learn that there are different fundamental forces that act on a flying ball .they can now draw a picture showing the directions of the forces acting on the ball and retrieve the formulas easily form their sketch .if they were now given a different problem of moving objects they are also able to indentify the forces and thus deduct a set of formulas describing the motion .had they only learned the formulas of the flying ball in the first place , they are not very likely to be able to handle a different , but similar problem .another point i would like to make is the fact that once someone knows the underlying concept of a problem , they are also able to explain and to pass on what they have learend to other people .this is again due to the fact that they are able to answer questions going beyond mere facts .
