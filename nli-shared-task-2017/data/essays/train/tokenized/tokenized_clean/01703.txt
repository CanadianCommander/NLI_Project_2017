i think that learning is an everyday process that is determined by people s attitudes , interests and experiences .for this reason i think that a student can increase his knowledge throught different studying methods .i think that it is very important for students to have a general knowledge of as many topics and possible .analyzing general topics presented under the form of concept and ideas , it could be a good way to learn new things without having to study every detail of that particular topic .this is the case of subjects related to the humanities .it is not necessary to learn to exact year in which a particular theory has been developed .simply knowing the period and the concept of a particular theory , it can be useful in every field .when studying it is necessary to consider the topic analyzed .in fact there are many subjects that can be explained by professors using main ideas and concepts .there is no need to go deeper exploring all the causes and effects .in some courses the professors only requires a general knowledge of a particular topic .on the other hand there are subjects where learning facts is essential .some examples can be historic events .learning the facts is determining in order to increase the knowledge on the topic .scientific disciplines are another example that underlining the importance of learning facts , more that general concept .think that when a scientist does an experiment he really need to know about facts .to conclude , i think that every subject needs to be treated differently , because i do not think that there is a gerenal rule that determines if it is more important for students to learn from general ideas , than from facts .
