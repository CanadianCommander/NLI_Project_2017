it can be read every day in the newspaper , local facilities like the youth center or the sports club have to be closed .this mostly has two reasons : firstly , the decline in budged and secondly the problems in finding staff willing to work for fee .in my opinion , young people should contribute more to their communities .first of all , i believe that young people being member of a community activity like the local soccer club or the youth center has many advantages in their personnal development .and if an active soccer player or youth group attender is enthusiastic about his activity , he or she will one day take over responsibility and lead the group .in that way , the person gives back what he receives from the communityadditionally , community service is getting more important as the average age in a community gets older .older people need a strong community and young people contributing to it .young people should do more to make life more enjoyable for old people .in other countries like china or russia , there is a strong focus on the community .everyone contributs to the community and also gets something out of it .it is like one hand washing the other .for instance a family in china would help to paint the city hall in order to create a value for the community .western countries should take thes less developed countries as an good example how community live can be .in conclusion , i believe that the government should introduce a system to encourage young people to help their communities .it has to be mor attractive to do social work .for instance , i could imagine a system by which young people receive credit points for social activities they have done .these credit points can be used to get a discount from tuitio fees at university or to receive free membership of the local soccer team .
