to me , the whole point of advertising is to sell , thus when advertising you should try to seduce the costumer .in fact there are many things or features of the product that you can use to do so , as the quality or the price , but always the main thing of show the good features over the bad ones .i agree with the idea that advertisements make products look better than they really are , but i do nt see anything bad with it .indeed , our freadom of speech ensures us mainly the right to say almost everything to everybody , with some exeptions of course , but under this perspective anyone could told us anything , in particular how good is the product they are offering .most of the times , the advertisements do not lie or say anything strictly false , instead they focus on their strenghts .therefore is true that the products looks better than they really are , but is not ill will on that .indeed , it is the same thing you do when you go to a job interview , or try to approach some of the opposite sex for first time .think about it , in these ocations you try to look good , seem confident , very capable , intelligent or even sexy , realice that you are trying to look better than you are .although i consider that some exagerations should be avoided , becaouse they are not showing how good the product realy is , instead thay are a lie .for intance , see the all magical recipies , belts and all kind of crafts and offered to lose weight , everybody knows that is a lie .i think ths kind of things should be controlled by some costumer s agency , which should request some kind of survey or stadistics to support things that are stated on the advertising .anyway , is in the costumer and the costumer s agencies who will at the end decide which product deserved an which does not , our trust .this is the only way of realy punnish tose that make reallly exagerated advertiments saying lies or said unproven things about their products .but always whitout attaking the fredom of speach or see things in a particular prespective .
