as the technology advances , many young people enjoy the benefits like computer game , tv and so on .however , there has been negative factors such as broken unity between people , weapon using in young people such as killing person without thinking .and also there has been negative factor by technology .in my opinion , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .first , technology advances cut the unity between people .for example , the past generation does not have the machines such as tv or computers .so , people must rely on each other and must be active .according to scientific experiments , the active person are happier than the inactive person as young people .however , nowaday , people do not rely on each other and do not move actively because they are always in the world of convenience , entertation with machines .but , young people get stressed out because they find no purpose in life or get bored in life because they are just doing same things everyday !also nowaday , in many cases , technology is used in bad way which would harm people in nowaday generation .second , as mentioned in second paragraph , people need each other anyway in order to live .but when society loses the unity of people , people would fight each other because they only think of their convenience .as a consequence , the society and even individual would lose many things and could not be happy .third , from my neighbors , there are many old people .i sometimes ask that past is happy .and they said to me , `` well , we do nt know how you will feel you life , but we are happy although we had to work hard at past compared to nowaday .we all had hopes .in addition , there are many news that young people kill themselves or kill other people .it is because as mentioned in second paragraph , people trys not to adapt with society because in the home , there is everything you can entertain .but because you have to live with society , people must corperate with society .these could cause young people who are so deep in the technological machines to be stressed out .i think that young people enjoy their life less than the older people because of following reasons : first , unity is broken in many ways and cause troubles and many consequences to young people to live on .second , because many of young people are deep in games or tv , they find their life boring and think life as without hope .third , technology that past generation never has sometimes is used in bad way and decreases happiness in life .because of three important reasons , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do even though life becomes convenient and advanced because of technologies .
