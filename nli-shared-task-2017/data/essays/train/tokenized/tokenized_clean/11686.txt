although i understand the comfort of own car driving , i support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are several reasons why i feel this is right .first , we know how many people are getting the diseases like cancer and so many respiratory diseases from the pollution delivered from the vehicles , cars especially .in addition to causing dangerous diseases , the use of cars also spoil the greenary of environment .furthermore this pollution from the cars may lead to green house effect .by considering above reasons the people may reduce the use of cars in coming twenty years .second , the cost of fuel for the cars is trying to kiss the sky .normal people are too eligible to use cars .in addition , the natural resources like petrol and diesel are getting diminished in the earth .this may result in avoiding of usage of cars like vehicles which consume petrol and diesel .to increase the alternate for petrol and diesel people may have to grow natural bio plants which will replace the normal petrol and diesel .by using natural resources we may improve the availability of sources , in contrast it may decrese the efficiency of cars .this may result in decresing the usage of cars in the future .another reason i can give is that with the increasing technology scientists may invent new techniques with which people can fly with their own hands .they may invent flying machines with which a group of people can travel at a time like as comfortable as in the car without any cost .morover this type of inventions will reduce the pollution problems that we have now like sound pollution and air pollution .in addition to that it not only prevents accidents but also the life style of future citizen .in my opinion , when technology is increasing it will definately replace a fault thing with a new thing which will be more effective than older one .in the same way the usage of number of cars will decreas with the replacement of new technology .
