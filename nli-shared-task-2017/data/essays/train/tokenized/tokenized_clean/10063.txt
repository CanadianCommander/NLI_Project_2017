the issue at hand is whether the young people today devote ample time in helping their community or not .the topic is very important because of it deals with the youth , who will decide , dominate and mould the future of the world .i disagree with the statement .i think that young people invest a lot of their time , energy and resourses in working for their respective communities .the first and formost reasons for believing so comes from my personal expericeince .i along with my friends regularly spend time in doing community service .this was a habbit inculcated by my parents long ago but i am proud to mention the fact that even now i stick to it , though no parental check is present now .various surveys conducted by prominent ngo s ( non government organizations ) have highlighted the fact that , that recent years have witnessed a steady increase in the number of young people and students who voluntarily come forward for doing community work .since any kind of community service would also require a lot of physical activity apart from the obvious financial investments , it is but obvious that the youth should take the onus of this task .springing up of a large number of bodies , organizations and other institutes which work in the area of community service bear testimony to the fact the youth today has not shunned it s social responsibilities .infact coming across students who spent a mjor part of their summer breaks doing community service , has become more of a rule rather than an exception .infact to encourage this trend further , now almost every professional organization as well as educational institutes allow their respective employees and students to carry on with their community work apart from their designated assignments .in the light of the above reasons i can confidently claim that young people today devote sufficent time in helping their respective communities
