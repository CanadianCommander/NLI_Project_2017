in the following i shall give my opinion about the question of whether it is better to have a rather broad but not so deep knowledge of several academic subjects or whether it is better to be an expert in one specific subject .honestly speaking , i do not think there can be a general question to this answer .i believe it depends on the aims and professional goals a person has in life .for some people it might be better to focus on one thing and become really good at it and for others it might actually be smarter to become familiar with a variety of different subjects .speaking for myself , i think dealing with a broad range of academic topics is the better choice .this is due to the fact that i still do not know what job i will work in later .i do not feel ready to already specialize in one specific subject .what if i am making the wrong choice ?another reason for me to prefer a broad knowledge of academic subjects is that people who know about a variety of things appear more educated to me .whatever question one might have , they always feel ready to answer -- at least most of the times .now imagine you are spending time with a person that is specialized in one specific field but does not know anything else .if you do not happen to be specialized in the same area as he or she is , what are you going to talk about ?it could become quite a boring as well as frustrating experience .furthermore , i am of the opinion that people who have broad knowledge in a variety of subjects are more likely to have a very successful career .we just have to look at high executives in the business world .many of them did not specialize in business in university but they studied a variety of topics including `` art history  or other subjects which do not necessarily have to do with the job they are doing now .what companies want today is people who know about many different things .as i said in the beginning this might not be the correct way for everybody , but with my personal goals it certainly is for me .
