i agree that in the coming years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .with advancing technology and with more complex machines being developed , people are slowly realising the harm that this development is causing us .with the information technology boom today , outsourcing and communication has become so much more easier than before .gone are the days of the good old letters , its the era of electronic mails .all these sophisticated gadgets and machines are a double edged sword , with both their positive and negative points .people prefer to travel in cars , trains and buses rather than walking .this has given us a lot of health problems .children prefer playing on video games rather than outside with friends and so we see the problem of obesity becoming very common among adolscents .thus , modernization has had a great deal of impact on our health .i think , twenty years from now people will become more health conscious and so will strive to maintain a healthy environment and a healthy life .so , there will be fewer cars on the roads and more people on the roads .another important reason , why there will be fewer cars on the roads is that , population explosion will be a major problem in many countries .in twenty years , the earth is going to have very little place to accomodate all of us and hence will be teeming with humans .so , there wont be any place for us to drive our cars that time .contemplating these problems in the future , using advancing technology , man will definately come up with newer designs of cars and other vehicles , which will not be required to be driven on roads .man will stretch his imagination and may come up with flying cars to tackle these problems .flying cars and cars that move vertically on buildings may not seem so uncommon twenty years in the future , thus , twenty years in the future we will be seeing a change in the attitude of the people , who will have a mixture of the the psyche of the people of the past and also a contemporay way of thinking .thus , for different reasons , be it for health purposes or as a sign of advancing technology , we will definately see fewer cars in use than there are today .
