the tecnology changes and effects our lives very quickly and very effectively .sometimes the changes are so good and sometimes they are not .the tecnology invents lots of things that we never imagine before we saw them .in twenty years , i think , many changes will occur .maybe we are gonna travel by planes to everywhere or our cars will be able to fly also ; who knows ? ..i can not say this can not be happen but i do not think this will be happen .i do not agree with this statement .because most of the people prefer to use cars than any other transports .cars are the most common transports , i think .because almost everyone has an one , even , in a family every person has theirs own cars .i do not think lots of years later this common transport is not gonna using .and also there are plenty of cars races .most of the people like this racing and they want to drive a car like them , too .for instance if you are driver in formula 1 or another organization like this you can not give up cars because you are really addicted to cars like a medical substance or medicines .the life is for you the cars .moreover these vehicles are very usefull and economics than the others .for instance the plane tickets are very expensive so you can not travel by a plane if you can not afford this .and also if you want take your cars with you can do this .but you can not take a yacth or something else like that .in conclusion , cars are very usefull for our lives and so economic to affords theirs  needs too .
