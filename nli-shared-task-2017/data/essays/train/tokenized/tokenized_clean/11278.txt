many people say that a student s main job is to learn facts-sometimes by heart .it is true that if a student does not learn his lesson he wo nt be able to understand his next class or get a good grade on his test .but is learning everything ?is it enough to fully succeed as a student .can a math-student pass his exams only by learning his theoremes , definitions and demonstrations ?learning is the basis for a student .one time , i had so much work to do and papers to hand out that i did not learn my lesson for the next class .and i was lost the next period !this experience enabled me to realize how concentrated you are and how well you understand the next class when you learn facts .when you learn something you make an effort and then ask yourself questions about a fact if you ca nt fully understand it .but some people learn their lessons in a mechanical way and i disagree with this type of organization .when students learn by heart only their short-term memory is working which means they only remember things for a short time-period .when i learn my maths-definitions i repeat them to myself but try to understand them .this theory works because i have observed that when i do nt fully understand a definition i do not remember it in the long term .when you understand or try to understand a lesson you ask yourself questions about the topic which makes you want to know more and helps you develop extra-skills .students who want to understand ideas and concepts ca nt be inaccurate in their work and develop organization and clarity skills .in conclusion we are faced with the fact that both learning and understanding are useful methods for a students .to be totally efficient a student has to learn and understand .
