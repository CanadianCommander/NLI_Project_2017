i would disagree with this statement for many reasons , main reasons that are to be explained in the following essay .first of all , i believe that concepts and ideas are barely understandable if there is no fact to illustrate them whatsoever .indeed , let s take pavlov s animals conditionning concept saying that you could make anyone make anything simply by making him repeating the task that you want him to achieve everyday , several times a day .well without his experiments , you could nt think that it s actually true , however the concept could have made you think that it was applicable to anyone , however , scientists have proven that it s not this simple , regarding humans in particular .besides , facts allows you to set `` real  references to your beliefs , references you could keep for the rest of your life .this `` real  part is another drawback that make concepts less important for students .simply because a concept is an overall general idea about one topic or common acknowledgement to something theoritical , it makes it lose its sense to a student s eyes .you need proofs and facts to build your opinion .this is what we call the proof by evidence .a fact can not be a concept since it s too singular , however , to me and to many student , a concept is nothing without facts .if we talk about the relativity concept established by albert einstein few decades ago , it still undergoes a lot of controversy and is still being tried to be broken down .finally , according to history , because facts make people moving on more than concepts , they are more important to a student s eyes .for a long time , everybody have been knowing the concept or idea that energy waste could result in serious consequences for our earth , everybody ignoring it and not taking as seriously as it should have been taken .nowadays , the alarm has been triggered because of facts happening such as weather issues , environment concerns . ..probably too late .to conclude , facts have proven their efficiency more than concepts , and this is the reason why i truly believe that they are more important than them .
