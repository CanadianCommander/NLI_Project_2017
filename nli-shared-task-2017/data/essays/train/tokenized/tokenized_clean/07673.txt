nowadays , advertisements are one of the most important facts which influence products .i do agree with the statement because of the following resons i will discuse below .honestly speaking , most advertisements aim is to promote the product so people will will get fascinated and attracted which will result in buying the product .sometimes companies use this as an advantage where customers get fooled and faked with the beautiful advertisement they saw in television .to give an example , once i was watching a movie on the television and suddenly an advertisement showed on .my friend love cars too much thats why he got interested in the product which was promoted .it was a car with a romote control working with petrol .he was also fascinated on people servuy which they showed .my friend mike told me that its an amazing car .therefore , he decided and i could not debat with him on his decission .however , we went that night to the biggest mall in united arab emirates in dubai .we bought that product and come back home with a complacent and satisfied mood .to make things clear we tried the product as soon as we reached home and what a depressed feeling mike got !!it was not the car which was showed on television .the car we bought was not highly modified as we have seen it in the advertisement .we understand from this example that alot of products which shows on advertisements may not be as real as it appear .on the other hand , advertisements are made better more than they are and this is to attract the customers .as a matter of fact , all businesses aim to make profits and i think advertisements is one of their policies .in conclusion , i want to say people must take care when buying a particulare product .therefore , we should not take our dicission just because of an advertisements .
