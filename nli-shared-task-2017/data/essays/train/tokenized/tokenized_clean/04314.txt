some people believe that they must not help other people if the actions do not provide any benefit to themselves .others , like me , believe that few hours every week must be used to help the communities .i would support my view with a couple of reasons .first of all , living in italy , i know that most of the young people in my country works or studies not more than eight hours a day .other people , like chinese , work for at least 12 hours a day and they have not time to do other activities after they have finished studying or working .conversely , italians could spend a lot of hours doing social activities that could help the community .for example , someone studying in the university located in the centre of rome goes back home at 5 p.m . ..probably , he could remain in the city and dedicate his time to disabled people helping them to come back home easily , for example helping them to get into the buses or to take the subway .unfortunately , italian guys prefer to watch soccer matches on television or go to the restaurant with friends .second , in my opinion governments should think a law regarding young people activities in social communities .my view is that few people would do helpful social activities without a strong committment from our state .in the case of italy , there is not a law regulating actions that young people can , or must , do in order to help the community .probably a good law should oblige young people that are not still working to spend on this activities at least 2 hours a week .in this manner , the state would help both the community and the young people , taking them far from television or playstation .in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement .in my opinion , every person that has some free time during the day should spend few hours in social activities in order to give benefits to his community .
