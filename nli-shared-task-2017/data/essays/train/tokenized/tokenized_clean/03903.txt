`fake it until you can make it  is one of the main ideas i try to keep in mind in my life especially when i need to make decisions .i believe a person should be able to take risks and try new things in order to be successful .if one s limits itself to want it already know how to do well it has no chances to evolve .for me having this attitud is like taking the highway to been bored .life has to be a game or at least a challenge .how often do you realize that you just did something you could not imagine you were able to do ?this behaviour is for me the simple key of success , it is what makes the difference betweem two evenly skilled people .in order to enhance one s chance to have this positive attitud , i would even recommand to add an acting course to highschools  core curriculums .it would help students to overpass their limits and explore their complex natures .another characteristic that is necessary to access this behaviour is self confidence .you need to trust yourself and believe in your capability to adapt yourself and learn quickly .but of course this behaviour is successful only to working people .you will never be able to make it if you do not work and just keep faking it .furthermore it could eventually destroy all you have done by discrediting you .if you not not plan to work , you should better stick to what you know how to do well .finally this behaviour is leading you to success only if you aim for something you are capable of .
