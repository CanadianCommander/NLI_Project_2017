young people nowadays tend to be less helpful to the community .i think there is quite a variety of reasons for that phenomen .firstly , time nowadays is quite rare .there is a wide range of persons and institutions that require our time .from child to adult people have to do a lot of education and gain some practical experience .at the beginning of a lifetime parents and teachers want us to learn .some years later job is requiring additional education .it seems as if education is always a main topic in a life .nowadays things are getting faster and more is being expected .this prevents young people from investing time in projects that limit their own educational and spare time .secondly , especially in cities live a lot of people .for inhabitants of cities it is not possible to know all or just a large part of them .but before people deside to help someone , they often want to know at least some details about who is going to have an advantage .as long as you do not know who is going to have an advantage , you need a lot more of encouragement .i made that experience as well when i was learning for my exam .i choose a quite room in zurich to study .but i had to find out that a lot of people just do not care about others .their first aim was to get their problem solved , which required a talk to other people .furthermore , society nowadays does not really expect us to help community and therefore does not honor it if we do so .finally , it can be said that a lot of people - as long as they do not get an immediate return on their help - are not ready for providing assistance in any form .
