with the young and the old people , we have two different way to see things .in some points you enjoy more your life as a young personn than an old one , but this statement works in the other sense too .for a young personn , life is a train that you do nt have to miss , in other words , you must enjoy your life as much as possible as a young personn , because when you get old you are not able to do all the things you were able to do before .when you are young you have a permanent energy that gives you this happiness of living that allows you to do everything , like go out on the evening and go to work the morming after without being tired , or just pratice a lot of activities like climbing , scuba diving . .for sure , scuba diving is not advize for old people because of heart problems .this example justify why being old can appears as the end of the freedom .you are more fragile , your body is not the same , you are not the same .but being old is not essentially the end of life .as the wine is getting better when it s getting older , people become better when they getting older .in fact , you become more confident because of all your past experiences .you become a brain who knows everything and who did everthing !that s one of the biggest advantage of being old , you have a knowledge of a lot of things .it s not the only thing , when you are old you can make a comparison with the past , society changes , new products appear , you enjoy to see all the improvement of the world you used to live in before .by the same time you become grand parents , and you enjoy a lot to be with your grand children .in my opinion , you enjoy more your life when you are young , because you are more able to have fun .when you are old you are often seek , your body does nt work as good as its was used to , and futhermore you just remember the past , when you were young .
