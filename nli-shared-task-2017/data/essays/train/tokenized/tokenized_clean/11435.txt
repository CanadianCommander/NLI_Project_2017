i disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think they just enjoy different aspects of it .young people are more adventurous and older people are more wise .when people are young they are still discovering what life is .they have a lot of opportunities and not many responsabilities yet .they seek for new experiences .a young person usually enjoys having fun and spend time with his friends .success in school can bring joy to the life of a young student .i personally enjoy the fact that i am creating my own future .i love this season of my life .older people enjoy other things about life .i think that being a father or a mother brings a lot of joy .i think that the older enjoys more calm entertainment .it a time in their life when people ponder more about what the past .
