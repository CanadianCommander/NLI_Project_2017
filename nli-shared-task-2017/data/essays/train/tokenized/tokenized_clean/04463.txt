i agree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .as we can see in the everyday life there is a decresing amount of space to get around with cars .parking it is becaming a real challenge , and the frustration that builds everyday is assuming very big proportions .the statistics showed that in twenty years the population of the world will be at about six billions .right now we are only four billions .what that means is that the level of pollution of the air it will be unlivible for any human kind .the space available per person will decrease and the drivers will have an increase in anger .unfortunately we are able to see that in indonesia right now .their problem is that everybody uses a car .therefore , living in a confined country , with an increasing population does nt allow a sanitary and better life .so , to avoid this problem , we should decrease the number of cars by simply applying to few rules .first of all , we should make a law that forbids people to drive by themselfes .what i mean is that cars should be considered for a minimum of four people .if that does nt happen the owner of the car should nt be allowed to drive , penalty a tiket or worse .then the community should make available more community rides like buses or any other vehicle that hold more people than a car .doing so , we should be able to decrease the number of cars , the pollution of the air , the gas consumption , that nowdays is reaching incredible prices and we should be able to decrease the frustration and anger of everybody .in the meanwhile , another good thing that could be done is allow the circulation only to the vehicles that have a gpl or a methane implant .that does nt decrease the number of cars in circulation , but at least decrease the air pollution .
