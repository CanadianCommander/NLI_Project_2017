i agree that the person should focus on one specific subject .basically i can summarise the process for success as `` find and dig it .discussion might be related to what subject rather that how many subjects .sometimes people are concern of money or reputation .money is a demonstration of success and reputation is an elevation of social status .i agree that money and reputation are important .however , i also believe that if someone is loving what he is doing , ultimately he will receive what he planted .the person occupied business with more dedication , it will be blooming with many flowers .those who reallly perform what they like they can show enduring dedication .roumi once said that a person who stands in all gates can never stand in any gates truly but a person stands in one gate will stand in all gates .people who try to collect everything will end up with nothing .they will have many distracted ideas .his efforts were dispersing in many issues and his knowledge will be limited .he can not deepen the subject and knows the details .however when a person specialized in one subject , he gets a perspective of analyzing the problems .since he concentrates all his efforts in one field , he can become more creative .he will think of the subject all the time .many people have a problem about timing .they criticize their mismanaging schedule .therefore the time management concept was revealed as a part of business field .the time management is about work less and do more .how will we create this seemingly paradoxal case ?well , while we are squezing our days in a few issues , we will become more productive .every action will be complement each other rather that obstacle each other .so , i finally recommend to all mentors ( parents , friends , teachers ) to help kids to find the beloved subject and to encourage them to work hard .
