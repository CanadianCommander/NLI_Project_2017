in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .yes , i do agree with this statement .this is the twenty first century , we boast about better living , advanced technology etc .the use of palm tops , cell phones , better vehicles has all become a matter of mere show off rather than its actual use .lets talk about cars ; well we all want this luxury in life .nothing can be as exciting as a brand new car , and the number of cars shows how rich you are !in all this show off and luxuries we tend to forget the enviroment .its a topic which has brought concerns .its very obviuos , more the people more the number of cars .people are concerned about the pollution in the environment but equal attention is needed for the non renewable resources like petrol and diesel .as the name suggests non renewable resources are those which will get over in next few years .there are not infinite deposits of petrol , natural gases , oil etc in the environment .there is a danger that these will get used and there will be nothing to substitute it .these are non renewable because it takes millions of years for these resources to be formed ; and these are the resources used for driving vehicles .as said earlier we are more concerned about our luxuries .we have started using vehicles not only for long distances but also for short distances just because we feel lazy .the number of cars and other vehicles has increased exponentially , and its soon that it will come down in the next twenty years .as the petrol and oil deposits gets scarce the number of cars will drop down too .as they say , one thing leads to another .thus , depleting fuels will cause depleted number of cars .if we all realise this problem as soon as possible we will get good results .because the more early you know the problem you will be able to solve it before it gets too late .we can satrt walking the nearby distances ; it will not only help save fuel but also be healthy for the individual .apart from this we can start using renewable sources for our fuel purposes .for example using solar battery operated cars .we can also use public transprt systems to cut down on the fuel shortage .thus all this would help us see a better future with better environment and good amount of cars running on renewable sources
