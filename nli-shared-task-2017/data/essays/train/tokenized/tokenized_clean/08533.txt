students can learn about many thing in school .when students learn new thing , it is very import for student to know what they are leaning from classes .and there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts .i prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from the text books .to understand the basic idea is not simply but , in my opinion , it can expand student s abilities of thinking and creation .understanding new ideas and concepts can take long time and sometimes it could take few decades for students .it can be problem to learning new things .that s why some instructor and students take shortcut to learn new things .for example , when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio , so called ` golden ratio  which is believed as perfect proportion for every object .it is very difficult theory to understand for specially freshman and it could take more than 2years , but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory .even though difficultes to understand the ideas , students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it .it can be easy to creat new things with the basic concepts .for instance , a musician who understand the principle of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and lythm using the basic music element .consequently , i recommend to understand the main ideas when students learn new thing .even though it is hard and difficult way to learn about new things , after understanding the notion from the basics .it would bring great abilites to students .that s the main reason i study and research in order to understand the concepts in the class .
