i disagree with what the statement says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i have three different points of view between traveling in a group and traveling individually .first , if you travel in a group led by a tour guide , of course you do nt have to plan for anything because tour guide know everything what to do or where to go .it saves you time and you do nt have to get stress from planning for trip .however , when i go somewhere i do nt know very much , i d like to research first and study about the place i will go and the language they speak there .in this process , i will decide where to go and what i want to see during my own research .also if you study the language of the country you will go , you do nt have to rely on one tour guide to buy something or to order food .while you are planning for trip , you already earn so many things and experience .second , if you are with the group , you have no choice for what to eat .you have to eat certain food the tour guide already sets up for the group .when you travel , you want to eat the traditional food from local restaurants previous travelers recommended .i am sure tour guide will take you to some nice place to eat , but you have no choice eat something else .even for the food , i want to research what is the most popular food in that country and i will figure whether i can eat this food or not .if not , of course i will look for another place to go .for the last , traveling is all about the experience the new thing from new world at least i think .i do nt want to have a same experience what other people have .with group touring , you have to go same place and take a picture from certain place like others .whole group will have same memory from the trip .i want to build my own memory from expereincing the new world .
