do advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ?some people think that they indeed have the positive influence to make them much better ; others have diverse opinions .to me , i agree that most advertisements make products better than they really are .there are three points presented as follows :the major function of advertisements is to attract consumers  attention .for example , some shampoo companies mention that their product is the best among others by showing the positive results from their cosumers  surveys .by doing so , the cosumers might purchace this product by this persuasive evidence .in addition , some advertisements create certain interesting slogans which diffuse to peoples  daily life .the public might be influence by the slogans and start to mention it on a daily basis .by diong so , the reputation of the product will be increased , and people might not be awared of it .although people get to know this product and maybe to purchase it to see if it really works , this trend seems to make the product better than they really are .the last but not the least , most of advertisements are made to intrigue cosumers to buy the products .how to make people notice this product is the main intention of the advertisements .in order to let the public gets to know the product , some companies even invite a celebrity to show off in their advertisement .some fans of that celebrity might be interested in buying the product due to this factor .in summary , it is very useful strategy of using advertisement to attract peoples  attention to certain product .advertisements indeed make products seem much better than they really are due to the previous reasons .
