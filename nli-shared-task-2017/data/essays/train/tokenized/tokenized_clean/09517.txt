i disagree with `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it is just like advertisements tell a lie to consumers .for example , when my father watched a cm of clearner product on tv , advertisements said that it could erase all of things such as , coffee or ink .after he used it , it could not erase coffee one .it was not ture that the cleaner could erase coffee .he was really angry with it , and he said he would never buy priducts at the company .as a consumer , you can not know about products which you can not use for a test before you buy it .you just watch some cms of a prodict or look a product in the store .the other view is advertisements is to sell products a lot to consumers , so it might be natural thing for them to make products seem much better than they really are .however , that is really big criminal at the point of telling a lie .becuse of that , consumers should need to compare with other products , and you should decide by yourself which one is good .also you have to use our mind and think about `` is that cm really true ?`` .finally , advertisements should make products seem they really are ; otherwise , consumers will nerver trast them .also it should be a big problem .
