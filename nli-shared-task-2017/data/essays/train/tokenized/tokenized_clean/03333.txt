nowadays , many students are studying many academic fields and at the same time , it is a problem wether they must have broad knowledge or specialized knowledge .i agree with the idea that it is better to have broad kowledge of many academic fields .there are two reasons for this .first of all , broad knowledge is base of all academic skills .for example , in my university , i must have taken many fields of lectures in my first grade .afterwards , i study a specific subject , communication .because i learned many academic fields , i study my major more effectively .moreover , knowing many academic fields can be useful in many ways .for instance , when a doctor makes up his mind to start his job as a doctor , it is important where to build the hospital , what ages of consumers in each areas , and so on .that is the time when business management or psycology are useful .secondly , common sense is needed for living in society .for example , i live in japan and especially in japan , companies strongly hope new workers to have common sense because japanese are having less and less common sense these days .for these reasons , i agree with that having broader academic knowledge is better .i think broden knowlwdge of many academic fields is base of our studying and lead to have common sense .
