in my opinion young people nowaday do not give enought time to helping their communities .generation after generation people ere more and more selfish .they think only by and for theirself .ecology , seniors and underpriviledge people are gived up by young people today .since the first period of the history , humans has decided to live in community .but until this time communities has grown more and more and then they had been dislocked .people has forgotten how and why we lived in common .the reasons was a better way of life in the best possible environment .nowaday , seniors are older and more lonely than before .however , they are our history and we have a lot to learn from them .children should take care of them to learn their own family history and to have enough culture in order to do not the same mistakes done in the past .for example , in my family without the help of my grand father i never should have known how and why the world war 2 was .memory is a way to never do that again .underpriviledge people should be helped too .anyone could be in the same case during his life so a children must learn : do what you would like that people should do for you .morever , in those day helping community is necessary to go on to live on earth .the temperatures are higher , the water disapear and a lot of natural ressources too .young people must give some times to help their planet and rescue it .they can clean the beaches or learn to the other people what is bad im their day life for the planet .in summary , communatory services have a lots of good sides .to help
