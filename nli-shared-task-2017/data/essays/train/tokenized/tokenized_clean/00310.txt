given an oppurtunity i would like to answer the question basing on the country about which the question is being asked .in my perception the answer completely depends on the nature of the nation and the people about which we are talking about .so i would like to both agree and disagree with the given statement .in the present day world we have nations with various economic status .there are developed nations , developing nations and underdeveloped nations .we can see a definite distribution of the number of cars in relation with a country s economic status .a developed country has more number of cars per capita than developing countries which are followed by underdeveloped countries .since much of the world population still lives in developing or under developed countries we can say that number of people owning cars in the present day is less compared to that who do nt own .as time passes nations gradually develop and the per-capita income also increases so the purchasing power of a citizen .so we can see that number of cars should rise in the next twenty years .but this alone is not the point .as the number of cars increases the fuel consumption in countries would also increase leading to a fuel scarcity and hence price rise .but this will again not be the same globally .countries which are rich in oil will have a comparatively much lesser price rise than others in case they do nt want to export their oil .so we can clearly see that the citizens in these countries can afford to buy more cars than others leading to an increase in number of cars .another point to make is environmental concern .since increase in number of cars would lead to an increase in green house effect people concerned about the same would tend not to use cars .but again we lack the data regarding how much of the world population is ready to give up the comfort of using cars for sake of environment .another important point to think about is the public transport system in a country .if the government improves the same people may tend to use cars in a lesser number .this again would vary from country to country .since i have no information about the above mentoined points i ca nt caste my vote to whether number of cars would increase or decrease .if i were given the data regarding the growth rate of various countries their population , their economic policies only then can i clearly say whether there would be an increase or decrease in number or cars .
