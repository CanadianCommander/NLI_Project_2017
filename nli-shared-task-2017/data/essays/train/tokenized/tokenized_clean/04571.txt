some people prefer to learn knowledge of one specific subject as they think to study lot of subjects is time consuming .however , i think to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial for the people .as the subjects are little bit connected one another , it will be helpful to learn other subjects .also , the more subjects someone have , the more choices can get in choosing majors .firstly , subjects are conntected one another .it can make people to learn lot of subjects .for example , if i have to solve math problems , i have to learn both english and mathematics .that is because i have to understand what the problem requires and to learn how to solve it .it means that even if i have little knowledge of many subjects , if i have chance to learn one specific subject , i can learn more effectively because i have basics of the subject .however , in case of studying one subject , one have to learn only the subject he/she choose and if one wants to learn other subject , he/she have to learn it from the basic .secondly , people can get broad choice in majoring .as one have lots of knowledge , he/she has to choose what subjects specially interested in .for example , in case of studying one specific subject such as music , person only have choice to choose music major .however , in case of learn lots of subjects , i can have many choices in majors .also , if someone has problems of majoring specific subject , he/she can transfer to the subject that he/she learned .in case of studying specific subject , it can not .for the reasons i mentioned , i want to suggest people to have broad knowledge of academic subjects .because it can give people to learn lot of subjects and people can get lot of choices in choosing majors .
