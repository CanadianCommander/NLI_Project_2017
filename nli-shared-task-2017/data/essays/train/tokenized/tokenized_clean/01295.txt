people in all over the world have education during their lifetime .the education never stops .it is impossible to learn everything but it is better if a person have information about everything as much as possible than keen on only one subject and do nt care about the other points .first of all , people judge the others not carefully and it is really difficult to change their ideas .for example , in a crowded place where people discuss their ideas , people may talk about every topic and if you are not have an idea about the subject , people do nt think about your knowledge in another subject .so they would think that even you are uneducated instead of searching you about more .secondly , having information about other subjects help another subject to understand easily or better .for example , in botany , it is also necessary to have information about chemist to critise and understand the chemistry of the plants .to sum up , to have a little idea about everything is better than to have an amount of knowledge in one subject .being not only a succesful but also a respectful person is very important in a person s life .
