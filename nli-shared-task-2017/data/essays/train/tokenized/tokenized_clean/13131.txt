i agree with the statement for several reasons .many centuries ago , the total amount of scientific knowledge was not very big .one usually think of a man of the 16 century , say galileo , as a complete man only if he or she master all the aspect of science .nowadays , every specific discipline has grown to an extend that it is impossible to master it all .for example , lets concentrate on physics .there are lots of very specific sub-fields , like barion particle physics or maser optics .it is impossible to know everything about all the specific sub-fields , even if we concentrate only in physics .since it is not possible to master an entire discipline like physics , i think the best option is to try to know a little bit about everything .second , people specialized in a specific subject can find very hard to interact with other scientists .every discipline has its own mathematical tools , its own vocabulary and its own way of thinking .therefore it is really difficult to get a good interaction between a biologist and a geologist .a person who can handle many academic subjects can interact with a lot of people .third , a scientist who has a broad knowledge can always get advise from a expert in a specific field when needed .it will be much harder for an expert to get an aplication of his knowledge in other fields because of the lack of knowledge of the potential applications .for example , it could be really hard for a matematiscian to get an application of some probability theory to sociology .on the other hand , a sociologist that knows a little of mathematics , could ask an expert all the questions he or she has .in conclusion , i think it is a better strategy to try to manage several disciplines .one can always get advise from an expert if needed .also it will be easier to interact for a person who knows about several academic subjects .
