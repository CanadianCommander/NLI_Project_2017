the thesis of the given topic is sucessful people are intrested to try new things instead of doing they already know .although some people disagree with the given topic i agree with the topic : sucessful people try new things and takes risksrather than doing old because of several reasons .all the reasons are explained below .the first reason to support my point of view is : since they taste the sucess they can try for new things .without inventing new things there is no world .since this people know how to do thing , it is better to try for new one .let us consider an example of early human being .at the first he knows only how to produce fire by using stones , this is a great sucess in early mans life .and then he takes risk and inventes the whell , clothing etc .from this we can say sucessful people try new things and takes risk rather than doing old one .so according to this example we can say sucessful try for new things and take risks .another reason to support my point of view : if a sucessful persons thinks this sucees is enough means there is no development in the world .so inorder to develop the world they try for new thing .another example to support my point of view is-if thomas .a , .adesen satisfies with the invention of electric bulb means we may miss his other so many invention like `` theory of electro magnetic  .since he knows the basics things he intrested to try for new things and taking risks instead of doing the same old thing .finall reason to support my point view is its is good for sucessful persons to try for new things .because of these things they may get good name and fame in the society because of inventing new things .more over they get huge amounts of money by selling new thins to the people in the siciety .so they try for new thins and takes risks insead of olsd thing .so in conclusion these reasons are enough to support my point of view .so agree with the given topic .
