i do nt agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think the young people nowadays do nt seem to be giving enough time to help , only because the people who say that fail to correctly observe what the young people can do , and are doing to help .they expect the help to be in a certain form , and they fail to see that the young people are giving help because the help of nowadays may not be in that form .for an example , let s say there is a child with a rare blood type .this child has somehow lost a lot of blood , and need a large amount of transfusion .but because he has such a rare blood type , him and his parents are having a hard time finding enough blood in the hospital , and need a living donor as soon as possible .when young people of today find out that there is someone like this , they take actions to help using new means of action , for example , by posting an ad on their internet homepages , or sending out e-mails to all the people they know , to go and donate blood if any one who sees the ad has the same rare blood type .if the child does find the right donor in time this way , i ll say that this is a good way of giving time to help someone in the community .what i want to say is that if the observers expect the help to be only in some physical form , such as going out to sweep the neighborhood , they wo nt be able to see this kind of help , and they will be apt to judge the young people to be not helping .the world is rapidly changing .if we observe the young people of nowadays using the standards that are decades old , they might appear to be not caring about their communities .but if we give a moment to understand the world now , and to compare and see how different the lives of today and ten years ago are , we will be able to see that the young people of nowadays
