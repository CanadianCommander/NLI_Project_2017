i do not agree with the statement .i think that one first needs to specialize in something .then , after this is achieved , one can interchange ideas with people who have other specialization .of course i do believe that while sepecializing in some subjet , one has to keep in mind which is the place of the subjet among the rest of the other subjects .and in this sense i think it is very important to have a broad knowledge of subjects .of course this knowledge will not be deep , but just an idea of the important issues of each area .i think that in the last 50 years scientific knowledge has grown in such a way that it is impossible for anybody to dominate all the branches of science .this may could have happend in the past , where the entire human knowledge was smaller .but this is no longer the case .so i think it is not sensible to intend to have a full and deep knowledge of all or many subjects .another related point is the laboral issue .i think that someone who has specialized will have greater job opportunities than someone who has a broad knowledge but has no specific specialization .at least when i read for job opportunites , all job proposals ask for specific proffessions or specializations .i also realize this with my friends .those who have gotten the better jobs are those who have specialized in something .
