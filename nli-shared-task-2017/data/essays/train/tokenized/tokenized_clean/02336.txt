i disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i think that using well one specipic subject is useful .we develop one subject .studies make many knowledge .so one subject is we become deep studing .various thinking become knowledge .but , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we will make nomal student .we have only information .one special subject is that student make thinking .also , it is important .
