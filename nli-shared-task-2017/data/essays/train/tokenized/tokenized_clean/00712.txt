i disagree with this opinion .i think , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .i have some reason to think about that .first , some company of cars are now inventing new cars , like hibrid car , electric car something like that .actually we can see that kind of cars on the road sometimes .we also interested in cars that are good for enviromental .car industries will change the their way to sell the car to customers .of course thought of customer for environment of earth will change in this few years .second , i think that puclic translation is not convinient at country sides .for me , i am living in country side , i can not ride on the bus or train when i want .it is difference between the big cities like tokyo and small city .so people who live in country side , they are using their own car now .i also use my own car .number of cars in country sides more increased than before .but the other hand , now gasoline is so expensive .if this situation will continue , number of cars may will dicrease .i imagined that reason .but , i think if costs of gasoline is expeinsive , bus company will change the time schedule not to move out .that is why , people will have to use their own car .japanese company like honda , toyota is famous in many other countries .if they invent the new car that not to use the gasoline so much or something , it will spread up all over the world , and then many people will be able to think about enviroment of earth even if using the car .it is very good for us .we should accept that kind of project .that is why i disagree with this opinion .
