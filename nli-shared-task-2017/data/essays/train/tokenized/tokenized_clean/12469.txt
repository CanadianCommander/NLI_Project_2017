i agree with this statement because i believe that who dares wins .i basically think that doing only what we already know can be the starting point of a career but if we limited ourselves to it for our whole life , we can not achieve success .there are several reasons why i agree with the above statement .firstly , i think that success is the outcome of creativity .if we see all the most important business men , for example briatore , we realize that they had to risk and start an activity without thinking about failure .all this obviously starts from an interest , in this case briatore was interested in formula 1 , but in my opinion he needed creativity to make an interest become a business .secondly , success is not a daily goal , on the contrary it is something really difficult to achieve , therefore it needs not only knowledge but even the ability of a person to take risks .as a matter of fact , success is something that probably lasts for only a certain period of time and for this reason , i think that all the successful people are not scared of failure , they are aware of it .the pleasure of success is probably more important than the fear of a failure .thirdly , successful people have often some difficulties in their private lives , because they do not have enough time to dedicate to their families , to their friends and partners although these are some very important aspects of a person existence .this reason support the opinion that a successful person must have the ability to take risks .as a matter of fact someone that does not want to run any risk , will unlikely manage to achieve success .in conclusion , successful people must have the curiosity to try new things , and the hability to take risks from an economical point of view but , above all , from a personal and private point of view .
