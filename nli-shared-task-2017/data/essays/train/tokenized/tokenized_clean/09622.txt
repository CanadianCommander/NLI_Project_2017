i believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to one specific subjects .the reason is , narrow knowledge is very unuseful .for example , when i am a student studying about only one academic subject , and if i must change the theme of study , i will in trouble and at a loss .because in the situation , i must study other subjects from very basic parts .but if i have widespread knowledge about other subjects , i will change my theme easily .but studying broad subjects is giving up to gain profound knowledge in the same time .one subject taker can spend his time for the subject only , therefore it makes him a professional of the subject .on the other hand , many subject taker must spend his time for each subject .so , wide subject taker may have just sharrow knowledge about each subject .this is the wrong point of studying many subject .but , i think , there is no reasons to have profound knowledge .because profound knowledge is useless in the social life .example , while i am working , i use no deep academic knowledge .deep academic knowledge makes no money .
