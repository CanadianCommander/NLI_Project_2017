i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .as we all know , technology and science is developing quickly nowadays .so there is a big market on producting and consuming on cars .how could human beings can drop this golden opportunity to make money ?fisrt , if you live in a big city with a car available , you can easily get to the destination where you want to be .you do nt need to get on crowded buses and waste a long time just for waiting buses  coming .for examples , in the late evening if you have something urgent and also we know that it is really hard to get a taxi or bus , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solved .second , now cars are invented in different styles and even you can choose what contents in it .so they are access to your needs such as high-quality stero inside the car .then you can enjoy the music during your driving .and more and more cars will be produced by car factories .the price of cars must be dropped to the level that ordinary people can afford it .finally , new energies are being invented by scientists .they will soon be used instead of petrol and gasoline .that is to say that cars will scarcely pollute our environment .so we do nt need to worry about those gases such as carbon dioxides and acid rain which destroy atmosphere and constructures of our city .all in all , we can clearly see that how a car is convenient to our life .my friends always proud of that their can drive a car and they are very addicted to the enjoyment of process in driving .so we can infer that there will be more and more people who are willing to buy their own cars and that will promote our country s develpment .
