this statement is not always true .for example , if you talk with a young boy emarginated by the others or with an older man that travells a lot you revaluate the argument .anyway the sentence is true in the major parts of situations .for young people is easier to enjoy life .there are many attractions , places , events for them than for the older people .youngs can go to disco to dance , they have no problems of money , they can go on holiday and find new friends easier .they have not any real problems or very difficult situations .they do nt care about the future and so they can live the present completely .the most important thing is that they are thoughtless and indipendent .on the other hand older people have nt many situations to enjoy life .people think that they fun only with cards-games or watching old movies but i disagree .old people have more problems than younger , most of them are healthy problems .but i think that they love life and enjoy it .younger often do not care about their feelings and i think that this is the most important reason for their sadness .i know that they like walking in the park but they will be happier if they stay with their family .they are not completely indipendent and perhaps they need the presence of the others to enjoy .i can find these explanation by my experience .first , i am a young boy and i know how i feel everyday .i think i really enjoy my life more than other people - particulary the older ones - but i know that it is not always true .i have a friend that is often sad about life because he does nt like to do what the other guys do , he loves to study a lot and he has nt a girlfriend .i think older people fun much more than him .then , i have a great grandmother .she is the strongest i have ever known .she loves to travell and she visits many places around the world .when i see her i do nt find sadness , never .i think she enjoys her life very much .the statement is apparently true but it could be also false to a deeper analyses .everything is relative .
