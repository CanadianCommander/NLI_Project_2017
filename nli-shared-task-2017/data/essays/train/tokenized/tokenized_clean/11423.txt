i strongly hope so !i am rather stuffed by the continous hearing of noisy car , the pollotion they produce and the stress they increase in people all the day .i think that the number of cars must be reduced for a lot of reason of any kind .there are too many cars in cityes : i m thinking of all the time i have been blocked in traffic , i m thinking at the stress that produce a situation like been in a jungle of clacson sound , peolpe that insult each others with no reason , all the important appointed posticipated . ..cars are expensive : since the car has began a status symbol its price has risen enormously .and the more people continue buying the cars at any price the more the price will riseair pollution is caused by car : have you ever asked yourself _ `` how does it cost all the publics works to clean the building of the cityes from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them ?  , or `` how dose it cost to restore the streets every two years ?the public transport can be more efficiet and less stressing :i think that public transport are the ony solution to the problem of the cars .we offcourse can not avoid to travel , we need to , we only have to consider more efficient way to move .the most importan features of public tranport is that the allow many people to travel at the same time with a grate maximization of the result at the same price .furthermore there are new technology that use not energy that involve pollution such as solar energy , wind energy and so on .i think that future must go in this direction to have a safe life for us and for future generations .
