i strongly agree to the statement that the advertisements ( ads ) make the products much better than the actual product .the ads and promotional campaigns are promoting the products to increase their sales and get enough profits but they never take the account of the consumer and its adverse effects on the users .the daily use products like toiletries and food products , their ads are so tempting that a layman just want to buy them .the ads promotes the products with all those qualities which may not present .some time they make the image of the product as it has all super qualities and it is the ultimate solution of all your problems , for example the hair care products .now a days a lot people are suffering with the hair problems and the companies are promoting the products that it is over night wonder and you will be changed person in 2 days or 14 days or so .but is it really true ??people are just going on the marketing stunts and they buy it with out knowing what are the consequences and side effects of the product .i know some people who have used these dyes and other hair products and now they are suffering with skin problems , which are developed coz of chemicals present in these products .similarly the advertisement companies which are promoting the food products .they also ignnore some concrete facts about the ingredients of the product or the quality of product .recently this truth has been accepted by the mac donalds that they are using animal fats in preperation of so called veggy burger .also , i would like to mention aboout the recent fact that just two days back a big bread company in england has been accused of not maintaining the standard and quality of food as some glass pieces and hair are found in bread packets .thus the consumers should not just believe on the ads as they are for the benefits of the company not for the consumers .but i would not keep all ads like the promotional ad campaigns run by government and some ngo and societies like wwf , who , etc. in to this category .their ads are genuine and are purpose fully made for the benefit of society and noble cause .these promotional ads should be supported and publicisize .
