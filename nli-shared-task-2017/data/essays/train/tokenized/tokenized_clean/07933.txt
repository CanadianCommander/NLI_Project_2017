i strongly agree with the idea that successful people are eager to learn new things and they like taking risks instead of doing what they have known well before .which three features do you think will certainly bring the success ?well , i think openness to experience and taking risks make a person wiser , more creative and more motivated which are the most important features .firstly , trying somethig new always make us gain more knowledge about the world sorrounding us .everyday we need to learn so many things since the technology develops so fast .knowing many stuff about plenty of issues will make us wise and successful people at the end .secondly , we become more and more creative since we activate our brains so much in the learning process .we make many connections about different disciplines and issues in the daily life .the artists and scientists are very good examples of this phenomenon .lastly , wanting to learn something new and taking risks lead to increased motivation in people .for example , i believe that i would not have such a big motivation if i was not interested in many areas of life .to sum up , in the modern world if we want to be more successful , we need to take risks and develop ourselves by new experiences and knowledge .these will also make us wiser , creative and highly motivated individuals .
