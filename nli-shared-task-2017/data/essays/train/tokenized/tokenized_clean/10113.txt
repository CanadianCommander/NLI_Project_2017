the humankind always needs to take risks to reach good life standarts .therefore taking risks is a very important aspect of humans life .succesful people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .some people think its really good idea but on contrary to those some people think that its not a good idea .i personally agree with the first idea , these are my following reasons .firstly , taking risk is a good idea because if you want to do something well you should take a risk .if you want to earn more money you should get risks .for example i read in the newspaper a businessman has a succesful company but he bought a new company although he doesnt know anything about it but now its the well known company now .secondly , its your luck to being a succesfully about your business .taking risks always earn us something .sometimes you can lose but you shouldnt finish to taking risks in your life .we can see that in our world who is the most rich or succesful man or woman came to these day with which risks theytook many years ago .in my country everybody says `` if you dont think to take risks in your life you always be with the same forever  and i really support that sentence .finally , all in all as i said before taking risks could improve our everything if we can do it succesfully .succesfully people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .but he or she should take care about his or her main thing which they can do succesfully , they only should take risk about it .because its important for them .
