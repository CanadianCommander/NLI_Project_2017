i fully agree with the claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .this method of teaching has been widly known and are having using through students all over the world .and i agree with this method becaus i believe students requires full understanding of concepts therefore they could have longer knowledge , and create their own thoughts through understanding the concepts .first of all , the most effective way to learn things would be understanding concepts and ideas .since students gets to undertand its concepts or the ideas , it makes them to fully understand it and also , it remains in students mind and it becomes part of their knowledge for longer than when they learn its fact .for instant , from my personal experience , i only remember few mathmatical formulas or the scientific terms that i have memorised when i was in middle school .moreover , i could only memorise few things even from last year which that i have learned facts .on the other hand , i can crystalize things that i have experienced .for instance , i have clear momory that i have learned from experiments in biology class which i experienced in younge age .in fact , understanding ideas and concepts are very importand to students and are more effective way to learn than it is for them to learn facts .second of all , understanding the concepts makes students able to thing further more .interestingly , most of the great inventeries such as phone and computers were came from basic understanding of the concepts .thus , sometimes facts works well for students to learn complex things .however , when students gets to understand it s concept or the idea , it makes numuries things becaue it lead them to think more spreadly and widely .in conclusion , it is best way for students to learn new things as creative way , and as perfect way when they understand ideas and concepts rather than when they only learn facts .moreover , education should work students to understand its concepts such as arts and life experiences .
