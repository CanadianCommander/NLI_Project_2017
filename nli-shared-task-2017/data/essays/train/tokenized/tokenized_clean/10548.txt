there is a growth in population .year by year , the estimated number of people on earth is multiplying .with this pupluation outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people .also , people are getting lazier each year and they will need a form of transportation to move them around .for those reasons , i think that in twenty years there will be many more cars in use than there are today .it has been mentioned in more than one official estimate that there is an uncontrollable population growth in the world .in under-developed countries such as the south asian countries , for example india and pakistan , a normal family consists of six to eight children .in gulf countries such as saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar or bahrain , a family is considered big only if the number of children exceeds six .now multiply those number with the numbers of families in each country and calculate how many people will be present in the world in twenty years .imagine how life would be if fewer cars were used .how will people move from one location to another ?some argue that there are laws these days preventing families from having too many babies .for instance , the chinese law that states that no family should have more than one child .even with those laws , one can not stop the rapid growth in population .another arguement proposed is that women these days are choosing not to marry for they have more job opportunities and can live independantly .new estimates show that the number of women is larger the number of men so even if 25 % of the women in the world decide not to marry , there will still be 75 % who are willing to settle down with a husband and have as many children as he wants .population growth will continue to be a problem and more cars will have to be produces to satisfy the people .unfortunately , each generation produced is lazier than the generation before it .by the time we reach the year 2026 ( keeping in mind that the year now is 2006 ) , the level of laziness will reach its peak .this is really sad but it is a fact that we must leard to deal with .people at that time in the future would nt want to move around on foot , or bicycles or any other form of transportation that would tire them .the only way to solve this problem is by having more cars to satisfy the needs of the generation will come .as my mother would always say , `` what a lazy generation !if that is what she keeps on saying about the present generation , imagine how it would be twenty years from now .it has been said that because of the population growth , there must be fewer cars .imagine life with so many cars !pollution will certainly be a problem , the streets will be much more crowded and people will have problems reaching their destinations in time for important meetings or deadlines .as much as i am aware of this problem we have to shine light on another important point .men are very lazy .they would nt want to walk to reach their goal or ride the bike .unless a new method for transportation is invented that will not tire out the new generation , more cars will have to be present by that time .population growths and the laziness of new generations are two main factors that will increase the number of cars that will roam the streets in the future .i am fully aware of the problems that will occur because of this but one can not live in denial all of his life .we need more cars .how else are we going to move around ?unless a new solution is proposed for transporting comfortably from one place to another , cars will continue to multiply in number as people do .
