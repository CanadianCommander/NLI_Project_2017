that s surely a good issue .it is impossible to me to look deep into the future to find an answer but , for now , i would certanly hope it .everyone understands how it is important to limitate the pollution today , everyone knows that in some hours it s almost impossibile to walk around .so , from a moral and ecological point of view , we have no other choice but to reduce cars .does this will happen ?that s completly different .we know that alternative vehicles are growing faster ( think at the ecological bus ) ..and that s sure a good hint on how the future may look like .a lot of people today prefer to use tram and bus to reach offices and other work stations .because cars does cost too much .and that s another issue .as long as oil based products will move cars , people will look to cheaper way to go around .there are plenty of cities all of over the world saying no to the cars , in italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day .that s a good start .another option i have to consider is a restyling of the concept behind a car : everyone would love a car with low pollution rates , free from the oil , cheap to use and why not . ..with a new look .we know that reaserchers are working night and day to create something that looks like that .the issue reads `` twenty years  , well i m sure that in twenty years we ll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old cars will get fewer and fewer .and do nt forget the development of alternative vehicles .mix up together the the two things and you ll have a picture of our future and so yes , there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
