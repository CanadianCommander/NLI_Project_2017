i agree with the statment `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  because i think travling with a group will costs less money and gives more fun , also the tour guide shows us more places to have fun with and helps us to orgnaizen the trip .first of all , travling with group helps us economically by make us share housing , and travling costs .for example , if you decided to travel by car alone you will have to pays the gas by yourself .but if you travel with group by car at lest three people will go with you at the same car and that will divid the amount of money payed for gas by four which means you will pay only one-fourth of the gas money .also if you travel with friends , you will share the room with somebody and that means you will pay half the price of the room .so it save money .second , you will have more fun .imagen that you will travel by yourdelf , play with yourself , and get pictures of yourself by yourself !would not that will be boring .but imagen if everyone play with you , hang out with you , and take pictures of you and the other : would not that considerd more fun .however , sometime even if you are travling with group you might not have fun because you do not where to go , or where is the importnat places that you need to visit and to prevent that from happening you must have a tour guide .the tour guide is important because he/she will orgnaize the trip by makimg scaduale for the touresm places and attraction , help us find the perfect place to live in and the perfect way to get there , and be responsible for the directions we need on the trip .finally , i think travling with group or friends and escorting by a tour guide is the best way in travling .becuase it make the trip more enjoyable , cheaper , and much organize .
