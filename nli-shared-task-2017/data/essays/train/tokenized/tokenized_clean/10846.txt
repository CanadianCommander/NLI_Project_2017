i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is because although young people usually have a healthier state than old ones , this does nt mean that this is the only factor that controls a person s enjoyment of life .i believe that each of these two categories - young and old people - have their own way of enjoying life .for instance , despite the fact that old people ca nt do some types of enjoyment that the youngsters can do - such as hanging out , and playing some types of sports - however , they also have a wide range of enjoyable activities that they can perform .the types of activities that older people can do to enjoy life often depends on the age category they belong to .for example people at the age of sixty or above often enjoy their life after retirement by buying themselves houses in quiet and calm areas , where they can enjoy the free time they have by relaxing .they can also spend their time in gardening , playing with their grandchildren and taking care of them , or discussing any subjects in life .they also have their type of sports that help them relax such as golf .on the other hand , people at younger ages - from forty to sixty - often enjoy their life by making trips around the world to places they have nt visited when they were young .this type of enjoyment , and other `` time consuming  activities , are usually not available for young people because they often do nt have enough time to do it .this is due to the reason that young people usually spend most of their time in their studies , doing homeworks , and writing papers .i again emphasize the idea that each has his/her own types of enjoyment , and that he/she probably wo nt enjoy doing what other people in other age categories do .
