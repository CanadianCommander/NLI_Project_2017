i completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .after all , if all of us continue to do what we currently do , and are good at , the human race will never evolve .innovation has been one of the key strengths of humans .some of the most important recent developments have taken place because a few people decided to try out something new , something that was hard to imagine before it actually happened .whether it was the telephone or the aeroplane , it was all because of people who wanted to try out new things .mankind could make it to the moon only because one individual , of the name neil armstrong was ready to try out something that was never tried out before , even if it meant risking his life in the process .even in the acient times , mankind discovered fire only because there were certain people decided to try out something new , even if it meant taking a huge risk .ordinary people like to do what they are good at .they are content with the idea that they are trying to get better at something .however , the real succesful people are the ones who try out newer things and take risks , and hence , contribute to the evolution and betterment of the society .if we continue to pursue what we have been doing , our lives would become monotonous .trying out new things and taking risks gives us the excitement and the zeal which propels our learning .we look forward to coming across newer expiriences , which teach us more and more , and give us ideas to make our lives better .we live in a competitive world and a key to success is to try out newer ideas and take risks - to find out newer methods and ideas of improving your life .in order to develop as individuals , we need to think out of the box - challenge our imagination to come up with ideas which have never been tried before , ideas which give us a significant edge over others .if you think you have something new to try out , it follows that you would have to risk a lot to make sure that it works .
