sucess is a famous word used in our everyday lives .why sucess is so important ?for me is something we have to figure it out .you ca nt said for being sucessful you need to be like this or like that , because it depend of our goals or the goals of our society .i m agree when is stablished that `` sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .i m agree with this statement because our life is compound by layers of goals , certainly a person without goals is a person without purpose in life .people who we describe as sucess is people who take chances , people who is prepare to take their life in their hands and make things possible .people who we admire is people that tried something new things and got sucess in it .how we are going to be call sucessfull is always is doing the same thing , and do nt try anything new to applied the characteristic of sucesful , for being sucesfull you need an action before the adjetive .how could we describe something that does nt happen yet .it is impossible .it is like our college live you have to take new classes everytime , but before taking a new class , you need to sucesfully pass the that class that you are taking in the actual moment .when you pass that class , you can go to the next level , why ?because you was succesful in the last want .the term of succesfulness is a term for steps in our life , but for keeping being sucessful we have to try new things in a new level to can be call succesfull again .i you do the same thing that you already know how to do well , you can be describe as you was succesful when you succed and learn how to did that well , but that was in the past , to be sucessful in a present tense you need to do something in which you could succeed .
