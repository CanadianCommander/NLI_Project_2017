i agree w ?th the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the facts are forgetten easily but concepts and ideas are more permanent than facts .when i was at high school i took lots of lectures that are h ?story , geography , maths , biology and etc .i was actually a successful student and all my exam grades were really high .however there was a problem .when i did not attend to the class i was stud ?ng before the exam , actually i d ?d not learn subjects in detail just knew what they were .thus i passed all the classes with high grades .when i came to university i recognized that i d ?d not understand many concepts well .i have just known the names or dates but why they are important is a question in my mind .somet ?mes ?n class teacher asks someth ?ng that must be learned before but i can not remember even the main points .the only lesson that i am favor ?n ?s maths which i really worked hard and examined many hypothesis and concepts deeply during high school .in many lectures i benefit from my knowlodge related to maths , so i am pleased to learn the maths well in the past .furthermore it proves the importance of understanding ideas and concepts when working on something .students can not understand the importance of this matter themselves , so instructions should be responsible for teaching something in an understanting way .
