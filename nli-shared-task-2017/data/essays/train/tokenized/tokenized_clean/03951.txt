i strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the car is a very useful thing which exist nowadays and it can be more cars but can not be fewer cars in use in the future .firstly , sciece development .sceince is changing very much in our lives .for example we can use emails to connect other people who may live on the other side of the earth , we can use mobile phones to call friend and we can travel to other country by planes .like these examples , the sceince caused alot of changes to our lives that we never even had a thought before .so in the future the development will change more cars to give our humans convinients .secondly , cars in the future will be more than today , but maybe can be seen diffrent from today s cars .the reason is because the fuels we are using today ; the oil , can not be still exist in the future , so maybe we will use other types of fuels to reduce our planet s pollution and to use cars .thirdly , people today are thinking about traveling to the other planets because we have been wanted to know how other planets are like and also had been thinking to live other planets , such as ; moon , mercury , mars jupiter and extras .so alot of cars will be made to travel to other planet .in conclusion , i strongly disagree with the statment that there will be fewer cars than there are today in twenty years .as i mentioned before , firstly because of science development ; will development can make more cars .secondly , because the exsistant of cars will be more than today ; the fuels change .thirdly , because of people s thinking ; to travel to other planets and live in other planet .so from these three points i strongly disagree with the statment .
