i agree the opinion that most advertisements make poducts make better than they are .now we live in the high tech advanced society in the 21st century .all over the world are getting more smaller by using the computer use .we can exchange information togethe by all kinds of communication systems such as internet and mass media .even though we purchase one items , we try to get informations all of resources .for the good example , most advertisements make customers guarantee their products .in order to become good brand products to appeal to customers , the company focus on better products .we can nt deny the advertisement importance to relate the good products .most consumers think that better products are introduced into the televions , radios , and other mass medias .most advetisments should be implied that advertisements products gurantee good gualities to attract the customers .now most company recognize that advertisement products should be the best products than other one to succeed the business .to take example coca cola drink , it is not american drink any more .it is the world drink all over the global village .without advertisments , it ca nt be exist any more .in order to survive the world brand drink , they have continued to improve the best soft drinks than other one .in the conclusion , i want to insist that more advertisements products should be recognized the better products than they really are .
