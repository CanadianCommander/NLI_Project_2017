as going to the high technical world , you have many opportunities to attach various advertisements of products through the media .besides , it is easy to recognize that most advertisements make products seem much better than reality , so sometimes most people do not believe inside advertisements facts .in my opinion , i agree with the following statement .there are three reasons that i can mention , such as exaggerated facts , desire of audience to the advertisements , and result of best seller between products which formed by real facts , and other products which included some lies .first , most advertisements have exaggerated facts .for example , recently i have some problem with my skin , so when i watch the television or read some magazines , i am always fascinated some medicine to solve my skin problems .also , one day i watched miracl skin care products , but just few days after , i noticed that advertisements is using exaggerated way to attrat customers by getting real facts from my friends .after knowing real result of skin care product , i felt very disappointed .such these happens always exist around our life .in addition according to statistics of advertisement management department , most advertisement are exaggerated looking like beautiful , and efficient , even if there has some rule how much company can add not facts in their advertisements .in addition , most customers have desire of the advertisements .the desire which is visually or attractive a way to present products causes that advertisement makers put more not facts .for example , if you watch the beverage advertisement , you can get colorful and beautiful scences , even though that is beverage .therefore , customers need to satisfy their desire of watch incredible advertisements even if that is not true .these facts affect symmetry between customers and advertisement makers .next , the result of best seller between products which formed by only real facts , and other products which included some lies helps increasing amount of exaggerated advertisements .in fact , the product that include some lies or visual things , that will be sold out in just few times .however , product which has advertisement that formed by only real facts are not influenced customers to buy it .as looks like ironically , customers need advertisement which is not facts , even though after buying products , they felt dissapointed .in short , these are three main points of supporting my idea that exaggerated facts , desire of audience to advertisements , and the result of best seller in mar
