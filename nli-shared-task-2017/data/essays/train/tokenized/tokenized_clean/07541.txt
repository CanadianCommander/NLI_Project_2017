travel in a group with a tour guide is gaining poularity nowadays and some people do consider it the best way to travel .however , it is not for me .i am a person who believes in self-discovery and i like discovering places on my own and at my own pace .for me , travel is a discovery and making friends with local people , getting to know them and living their culture is the true experience of travel .i believe in taking out time to understance the cultural nuances of the new place and attempt to comprehend the true culture of every new city that i visit .i have heard quite a few stories from people who had a fantastic time in group travel with tour guides .i myself have sent my parents to such trips when they come to visit me as they are old and having a tour guide is the easiest way for them to have a comfortable , safe trip in a foreign land .but , for me , with age on my side right now i do nt feel the need for a guide .i believe that when you travel to someplace new you should be in that mood - willing to explore , try new things and meet new people .traveling on your own gives you the opportunity to converse with the local people and the `` authentic  stories that you hear from them are incomparable to the pre-planned , oft-repeated stale information from a guide .so far my experience with a group led by a tour guide has been fairly limited .it was only on one occasion that i opted for such an arrangement and that was on my trip to kerala in india .the group was well organized , our itinerary fixed and lots of places planned for in the short trip .i do nt think i got the real flavor of the state as the pace was too fast for me to understand the diversity and the traditional values the country is so famous for .there are benefits of a group-travel .but , personally i am all for travelling on my own .i like to set the pace of my trip , relax on some days and explore a lot on some other days and most importantly , get the true flavor of the country and not just visit the so-called `` points  of tourist-attraction that group travel arrangements usually entail .
