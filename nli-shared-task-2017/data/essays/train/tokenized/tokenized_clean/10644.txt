first of all i have to mention , that the statement does not give any details about the age or profession of a person .i think that the advantages and disadvantages of a broad knowledge just apply regarding to the state of socialization of an individual .a broad knowledge has a lot of advantages in todays world .i would even say , that a broad knowledge is nessecary in our world of globalisation .we live in a multiculturell and globalised world .that causes a damage to the individuality of a country .kulture , religion and knowledge get mixed up .since the globalisation supports communication the broad knowledge is increasing rapidely .globalisation causes fusions of firms .combined firms need people with a broad knowledge and the ability to combine different subjects rather than knowing everything about a specific topic .on the other hand it is nessecary for every company to have specialists in each field .for example : the it section in germany does not have a lot of good qualified specialists .so the german gouverment applies for it specialist from india and pakistan .germany wout be able to meet the world-wide average knowlegde in information technics without the help of those specialists .my opinion is , that it is nessecary to have a wide spread knowledge as a young person to be able to be flexible in a multiculturel civilization .on the other hand i have to admit that every succesful company needs people with specialized knowledge to create knew knowledge .i come to the final decision neither to agree nor to disagree with the statement , since i believe that it isdependant on the age and spacific field of an individual whether the knowledge has to be more broad or no
