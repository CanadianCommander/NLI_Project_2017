i think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in fact ; you may come across few situations that some people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .but you ca nt see this kind of people generally .because they are very clever and hardworker than the normal people .if we talk about in general except this kind of people , i agree with the statement about specializing in one specific subject .the first reason of this choice is that the concentration on one subject is easier than more subjects .you can focus on that subject , make good preparations and think much ways of that subject many times .second you may not have much time for being qualified in many subjects .so you can spend your time only one subject and get more information and make yourself well educated about that subject .otherwise , you are supposed to dividing your time and power all the subjects that you interest in .third , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you may pay a lot of money for that .and you wo nt be well qualified in ne subject .and all you know will be on the surface of those subjects .you can never go deeper about the subjects .fourth , when people ask you your professionallity , are you going to say to them `` i have broad information many subjects but not one particular field .?it will be funny .so if you want to be admitted from the universities or the academic environment , you have to meke yourself professional in one subject .otherwise they wo nt approve your abilities .finally , you have to choose one subject that you realy like and adapt yourself very well and try to be qualified in that subject .you will see that you make the right chose .
