today , we are facing serious environmental threats resulting from the excessive use of cars .passing a gas station demonstrates us daily that gas prices are increasing tremendously .also on a day-to-day basis , the media tells us about political conflicts mostly resulting from oil issues in the middle east .thus , it may lead us to the question if the invention of the car was a good idea .moreover , it is intersting to think about the question if there will be as many cars as today in twenty years from now .i do not think so for the reasons i would like to give in this essay .first , oil resources are deminishing very rapidly and statistics show that we will eventually run out of oil and gas .this , of course , depends on the pace we are using our oil .but it seems very obvious that the vast oil reserves will be totally gone in twenty years if we use oil as we us it today .thus , as there will be no fuel in the future there will certainly be fewer cars as well .second , the car as we use to know it now is probably going to dissappear .technology develops at a such quick pace that there will be new facilities which will transport us and our goods in the future .twohundred years ago , people thought that the train is going to be the new vehicle of the future .however , as the car was invented , trains were not the only transportation means anymore , thus resulting in a decrease of trains being used .in the same way , it might be happen with the automobile .even today , cars are not used that often anymore when cheap airplane tickets become more and more available .lastly , i believe that the need to get from one point to the other will be not as high as it is today .in twenty years , computer technologies will have advanced in such a tremendous way that almost everything will be possible to do from home .this trend can already be seen today , as many companies are offering jobs that can be done from home using the internet .thus , people will not leave their house in the future as they do now and can leave their car , if the vehicle is still named as such , in their garage .in conclusion , i feel that it is obvious from the arguments given above that there will be tremendously less cars in the future .moreover , it is impossible to say if such a vehicle will still exist in twenty years from now .
