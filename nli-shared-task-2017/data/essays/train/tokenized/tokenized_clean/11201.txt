although it must be said that there are young people who do nt care about their community , i think that , in general , new generations are keen on helping their towns and do it in a variety of ways .there are many young boys and girls who spend a lot of their time working for the poor and the disadvantaged .for example , in my country there are several associations that recruit personnel to drive ambulances and one of my best friends , who has a very demanding and time-consuming job , works there without compensation at least once a week .another friend of mine spends every sunday serving meals to poor people in a church , and he often tells me that performing this service for the benefit of his community is very rewarding for him .but there are also other ways to help people ; skilled professionals can be of great help in certain areas .a classmate of mine , who graduated from a medical school , is now part of an association called `` doctors without boundaries  that sends doctors around the world to help poor communities in less developed countries .she was sent to africa and provided medical assistance to many people .i think that a person like her is a clear sign that young people are willing to help the others and therefore can be relied upon to become active members of our communities .in fact , if a young doctor is willing to help people in a remote country , one can be sure that she will be much more keen on contributing to the well being of her community .as for myself , i try to get involved in pro bono activities , too .since i am a lawyer , i was able to spend the past two years assisting poor clients who were involved in various kinds of litigations without charging them .so , the examples i see around me are , in my opinion , eloquent signs that younger generations are not less willing to help others in their communities than older ones .
