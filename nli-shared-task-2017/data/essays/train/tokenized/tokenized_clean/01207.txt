albert ainchtain , bill gates and all successfull people in the whole world began their life with a try .trying new things or experincing a new adventures in the life is one of the main characteristics of successful people .so , the one who spent his life stuck in one job or one life style is considered dead one , because the life he had was with no mean at all .therefore , i agree with that statement because of two reasons .the first reason is that if you are trying new things , especially in your job , you may be more successful .for example , if there is a trader and his major trades depend on specific prodct and he successed in that product , he may achive success in another product and he could increase his wealth may be more than before .but it needs a brave one and to make that decidition and this is one of the properties of successful people .the second reason is that trying new things make the person who attemped to try , has more experinnce than before and add new memories , regardless if they are good or bad memories , to that person .although , that experince may cause an inverse effect on the person , but at least he may learn new things that he did not know before .as a result , he may be a good wiser to other people because he has a huge background on many things .so he could be useful to others .in conclusion , trying and experincing new stuff in our life is the reason of why we are living on this planet .so we have to take advntage of that and try to acheive that aim of our exictance .
