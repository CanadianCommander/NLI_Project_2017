i feel to have specialize in one specific subject because of various reasons .initally , as we are concentrating only on single specfic subject of our interst , it provides lot of scope to study in details of subject rather than , superflusilly .i feel that having little knowledge is always dangerous because , it may results in many problems .for , example if i know a driving car partially and i go for a ride then this may lead to accident .any student or professor who concentrates only on single subject produces very good results .for example if we consider scientist `` albert einstein  who concentrated only in physics and produced great equation ( e = mc2 ) which is basis for famous princlple `` theory of relativity  .which is used in all nuclear reactions , to measure the relative velocity between to moving objects ...etc .if we specalize in single subject we can understand concepts involved in subject in an effective way .let us consider if i am specilazied in commincations then there would be lot of scope to get recruted in communications company rather than , the person with half knowledge in that subject .many universites ans colleges suppot to specilaze only in single subject as they provide in their finall semisters or in post graduation subjects of students interest i.e .. , electives .this provides student to encourage in field of his / her own interest with out forcing to no each concepts .so , i finally feels going for single subject is the best way to learn and understand as it provides scope for doing researches in our interested fields of study .i feel that half knowledge is just like `` half cup is always empty  it never gets filled up .as there are plenty of oppurtines in specific fields students should choose subject of their to excell in their academic and be a good citizen to country .
