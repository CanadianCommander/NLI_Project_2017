at first glance , we could easily think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .however , i disagree with this statement .there is no denying that young people seem to be much more dynamic , excited and ambitious than older people .as far as i am concerned , i have the feeling to do many more things than my parents do .i study sciences , i practice different sports , i play saxophone and i go out with my friends every week-end .by contrast , my parents are less active and prefer watching tv .in addition , i will not reveal the number of old peolple that told me that i was lucky to be young as if they were suffering from their life .hence , young people give the impression to be really excited by life whereas older people seems to be less enthusiastic .however , beyond these appearances , i feel that young people do not enjoy life more than older people do .first and foremost , young people are not as happy as others could think .especially in france , the youth face lots of social and economic problems that affect happiness .for example , last year , thousands of french students demonstrated in the streets to blame the government for not taking seriously into account the dramatic unemployment for young people .lots of them can not find a job even if they have a good degree and thus they do not succeed in making an adequate living to provide their future families .moreover , it is frightening to see how great the number of young people who killed themselves is .these example provide the evidence that young people are not as happy as others might think .lastly , we should not forget how happy lots of old people .being parents or grand parents might be one of the most important thing in a human life .
