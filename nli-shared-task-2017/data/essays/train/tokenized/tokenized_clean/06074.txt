travel indeed plays an important part in peoples live .by traveling , one can enjoy the peaceful nature or to experience the life of people in different country .some people would like to travel along or with friends while other perfer to have a tour .as far my concern , i think to have the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for it has many advantage compared with no guide .first , if you are going to a place which has some protential dangerous during the visit , you will definitatly need some help .for instance , mountain claimbing , it can be very dangerous when you walk on a unknown high mountain and without a people who fimilar with this area .a guide can certain garantee a safe and happy trip .also , a guide can provide you more details about the place you visit which map ca nt tell you .i was once visting a small town in sichuan , china .after walking pass all location on map , the guide told us there is an beautiful lake at the end of the road .when we finnally arrived there , every people including me were shocked by the unbelievable beautiful view there .i m sure that i ll regret if we did nt ask for a guide at the trip .finnally , if you are going to visit a new country and want to experience the local culture by yourself , a tour guide in that place is inevitiblly needed .by his or her introduction , you can easily talk and even live with local people .addmitidly , travel with no guide can give you more free choice .but from that has been discusses above we can safely come to the conclution that to have a tour guide when you travel can provides a better tirp .because it is safe and can give you more happiness .
