in my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn facts .just learning facts could bring few problems to students .first , if students just learn about the facts of any topics , they might forget them very easily , some students might not forget , because not every body has same style .however , if they do nt understatnd ideas or concepts , they will forget when they do nt study facts for a while and try to study again .it is why understanding ideas is important , if they understand ideas and concepts , they wo nt forget them easily .second , it is very hard to learn facts without understanding ideas or concepts .especially , for young students like elementray to middle school , they need to understand ideas before they learn facts , because most of thing they learn in school for example are the stuffs that they never heard about .therefore , if they just learn facts and not understanding ideas and concepts , they will get hard time in later like high school or college , even they still remember the facts .third , they can not discuss about the thing that they learned , if they only know about the facts , because they would nt know what they should discuss about , for example , students learn about the facts of soda , they ca nt discuss what are the pros of soda and what are the cons of soda .they only know that what is the soda .to get better knolwedge , those are the why they should understand ideas and concepts of the topic they learn .however , i would like to say the facts are very important too to know things , because students could know specificaly about the thing they learn with facts .therefore , my opinion is understand ideas and concepts are more important and the first thing to get before learn the facts .
