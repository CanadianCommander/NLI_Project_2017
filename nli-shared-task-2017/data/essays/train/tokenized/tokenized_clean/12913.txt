i totally agree that all advertisements show there products much more better than they really are .ofcourse that is what the advertisments are made for .the advertisments are done so they well attract the audiance s eye .and that is done by makeing an exaduration of the subject , becouse if that did not happen the audiance will forget what they have seen eventualy after they see something ealse .for example the cars advertisements , they well show that the car s desine is really fine and smoth by certine light reflictions that will trick the audiance eyes .also they will say that the car s engine is really powerfull that they will show some loud soundeffects of the engine like a formula one car , and also the speed of the car can be easly tricking the audiance by any special 3d effects .here the advertisments can engaudge either or all of the human sences sight , hearing and so on .imagine if the advertisements are done by showing the products how they really are like , then every products that are at the same calss will be sold or known by the same number of people .then there would be no real competision between the advertisement companys .my openion is that the advertisments companies should have a certine kind of inspection .that would make sure that the products are matching there advertisments , so in that way they well beld a trust between the audiance and the products that are been advertised in the future .
