the saying is true that most advestisments make products seem more efficient or much better than they really are .i have reached my conclusion due to the following reasons .firstly , like the product yoko height increaser .secondly , the advertisements of different chips firms .most importantly , the product about which their is alot of comotion in cannada .recently , when i was in calgerry in cannada their was and adverting that said the only thing that will increase one s height was this product .that was all false as when my friend told me about the the same product he used , he told me that the made false claims .he had being using that very product for an year and still their were no increase in his height .this shows how different firms in the world make false claims about their products .also , at the back of every chips packet their are the names of the ingerdients used of which some are harmful .but in a promotion , the promoter when asked about the quality of the chips being sold claims that the he/she is selling is the best in terms of health .whereas when one consumes the chips finds out that the chips actulaay have some harmul chemical , which would harm the health of the individual .from a recent incidence in my life , that wa ssince i had consumed a certain kind of chips , which was claimed to be advantages to health had actually caused me cancer .it didi so due to the pesence of an extremely hazardous chemical .the above examples explained show how an advertisement display it s product in abtter smatter and more reliable way than the product really is .
