making advertisements is important to sell products .most advertisements make products mutch better than they really are .i strongly agree with this and it is true for many reasons .one reason is it is better idea to sell their products easlly .if they do not do that , they wo nt find customers as they want .for example , when coka cola company wants to make an advertisment , they try to show for the audiuness that coka cola is the best drink in the world by making the advertisment like fantesy .in addition , some companies try to bring an famous actor or actress to attract the audiuness .however , they make some of the advertisments sexy .for example , when shampoo product company want to make advertisment , they bring usually a sexy girl with sexy design and long soft hair .why ?becasue when the do that , some audiuness belive that when they use this shampoo , they will be like the girl .they thought becasue of the shampoo , the girl is sexy and has a nice hair .forthermore , let s look at resturants  advertisment espically fast food .mcdonaldes company makes their advertisment with that clown to attract the children .however , they make the show fast as their fast mail to tell the customers that our mail is the fastes mails in the world .another reason is without better advertisments means no customers .if they do not do nice and parefect ads they wo nt see coustomers which cause problems in that company .for example , there is a new resurant and no body knows that resturent .how the people will now without ads ?in closing , ads are important for the products which bring a lot of customers .company without ads , can not be company .so the way of attract the audiuness is the ads .
