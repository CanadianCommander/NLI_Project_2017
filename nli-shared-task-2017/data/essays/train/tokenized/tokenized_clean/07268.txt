i agree with this statement because in my opinion a successful people have more money to spend than normal people .they can try what they want , and in their opinion anything is forbbiden .they want to try always new experiences , know new things and sometimes take risks .last week i have read to the newspaper that a famous italian singer decided to spent a month in a unknow place ( probabily an island ) .he wants to stay alone .none can go with him .he has not a personal phone because in this place the phone do not work in this way he can not communicate .he want to stay in contact with the nature .for find food he can only fishing or hanting .in my opinion it was a very dangerous experince but i think that the only reason that this singer decide to go is to increase in success .if he does not the economic possibility i am sure that he do not go .i think that is important to increase your knowledges , try news things but there are some limits that we must respect .it is good to do small things but well than more things not well .i think that a dream that the man have is to fly , but for natural conditions it can not possible .
