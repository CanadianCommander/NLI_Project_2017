in my life i study at the politecnico of milan and i work in a small company that produced electronics components .when i go , every day at the school , i study many subjects that has refered at the telecommunications .in this type the university i must before do three years to learn the basic subjects and then i can specialize in one subject of my course .i belive that there are my advantages and disadvantages to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects that to specialize in one specific subject .the advantage is that in this way i can have a lot of oppotunity of work and i can be very competivite in my work because i have study a specific subject and i understood every part of my work .for example in my life when i had finished my study , i known my product , that i had built , very well and i can be very competitive with the other companies that product the same components .an other advantage is that i can have a lot of money if i have a good specialization in stead of if i have not a good knowledge i have not a lot of money .this is the situation that there is in italy .the disadvantage is that to have a good specializzation in a subject i must study a lot .if i study a lot of subject i can have broad knowledge and i can be clever in many materials that i can see every day in my life .for example , in this moment i work in a company and i have not a specific knowledge but i have a broad knowledge of my subject and in this way i can see the vary aspect of my work an then i can deicide the subject that i prefer .at the end i prefer to have a specific knowledge of many academic subjects because i can understand my subject very well and i can resolve other problems that are specific in my work .
