recently , people tend to specialize in one specific subject .however i think that broadening knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful .in this essay , i will present some reasons to support my idea .first of all , i think that recent goal of our study does not want specialized knowledge .although specialzed knowledge is also needed , broadened ones are really required to us .for example , in the applied mechanics , statistics and management are also needed .if we do not know about them , we can only produce a safe something .however if we know about them , we also make things cost-efficient .by doing so , we can reduce wasted money and provide things on lower price .in addition , boadening knowledge of many academic subjects makes us diverse .if we are specialized on particular one , we would have narrow thought about what makes us puzzeld .as we have a variety of knowledge , that gives us diversed view .thus , various knowledge may result in synergy effect .for instance , since i was studying various subjects like statistics and mechanics , it encourage me to study hard .because i was boring at studying only mechanics , by doing so , i was excited to study mechanis .as a result , i got the good grades on both of them .taking all those into consideration , broadening knowledge of various fields makes us more efficent , having widened visioin , and having active motivation .we are living in a world that demands a multi-player .
