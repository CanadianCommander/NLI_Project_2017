it is a well-known fact that cars are one of the major causes of pollution nowadays .however , will we give priority to the environment over our own good and comfort ?on the one hand , there is a current growing awareness of the terrible risks that poses the pollution which has been generated throughout the last decades .knowledge about what is beneficial or , on the contrary , harmful for the society is increasingly being spread among both youngsters and adults by ecologists .on the other hand , people living today will not be alive to see what the world becomes in a few centuries .therefore , they do not really seem to be affected by the issue .personally , i consider that twenty years is very little time to make people get used to going on foot to work or to using public transport .we are still in the era of technology .as long as new cars are invented , there is not way to stop people buying them .in fact , the more the sellers offer , the more the customers demand .thus , the evironmental situation might even worsen by that time .let s take my father .he can not avoid buying the last model in the market .he is passionate of cars !despite the fact that we are aware of the threaten that this uncontrolled use of cars poses to our healths , people are likely to continue with their lives as if there is nothing outside there to worry about .but people will soon realize that there is a real need to stop polluting .otherwise , pure air will totally disappear and we will not be able to breath .even though i do not think that two decades is enough time to concious people about this worrying issue , i believe that politicians will get to an agreement in which they will look for the population s protection , since it is an issue which concerns us all .for instance , a good measure to be taken would be to put a ban on driving a personal car more than twice a week .from then and on , i am positive that people will think it twice wether to drive a car or to take the bus !
