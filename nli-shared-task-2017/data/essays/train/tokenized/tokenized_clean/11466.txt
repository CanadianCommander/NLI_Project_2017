i do not agree with the statement , that in twenty years fewer cars are in use than there are today .my opinion can be supported by the following facts .first of all the use of cars at high numbers is restricted to the so called `` first  world meaning mostly europe and the americas .in many areas around the world where we do have a high number of people living , like africa , india or like in china the use of cars is limited to a small amount of the poulation only .we already can see here first signs pointing in that direction looking at the growing infrastructures in china and india dealing already now the furture expansion in the number of cars .when these countries do further follow the path of modernization we will have in twenty years a much higher number of people being able to purchase and drive a car .and even in the `` first  world we do observe a trend to a further individualization being seen for example that people move out of cities more in rural areas .and in addition to huge countries like usa or brasil where people have travel rather long distances to go shopping or to go to a hospital , having a car is even more important .so we have here on the one hand a real need for a car for covering distances and on the other hand the personal wish to be independant and individual by having an own car .based on the facts desctribed above we will have globally an increase of the number of cars due to the modernization of major parts of the world and due to the individualization of other parts of the world .and both reasons do require cars either for just transportation or for fullfilling personal thinking .
