some people say that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities , because their time to helping their communities .but i do not think so .i have some reasons about it .firstly , young people are too busy and selfish .their time is occupied by their schedule .for example , in japan , my country , the number of people going to sram schools have been increasing with high speed , because the quantity of things for teaching public schools of japan was cut .in their school , they can not learn enough knowledge .moreover , many young people is always playng with their friends or is always staying at home despite of no something to should be done .because of those reasons , i think , they do not want/can not help .secoundly , recently , the oppotunity for have relationship in their communities is decreasing .especially , in urban areas , connection between people is very weak .for instance , my friend have never participated events of her communites , such as japanese festival , instead of only seeing it .my home town is suburban .so i often take part in japanese festivals .of course , all menbers of my familiy do , also , at the least the half of population of my town do , too .so i disagree the idea that young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping their communities .
