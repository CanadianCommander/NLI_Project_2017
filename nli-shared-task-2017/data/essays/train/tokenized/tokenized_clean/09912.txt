there is a wide difference between an idea and a fact .facts are not subjected to lies , and inform about real events .if one douts about afact , he will be considered as a stranger .facts are un changeable and studying them is unconsiderable .this is because one who study facts is like the one who study his name .do not you considere this as strange ?ideas are changeable subjects nourished by human beings .they may be true or may be false .all ideas are not 100 % true .studying ideas enhances the exchanges of information between people .it also encourages people to certify thrir ideas and to get good strict about their thoughts and feelings .but thid does not mean that we must leave the facts away , and accept the ideas from any one .this is because facts help us to learn how to get good ideas .the geoghraphic facts of the world are examples .i can not accept a stranger who thinks that the earth in flat , because it is a fact .ideas are not usually reliable also .ideas have to be not affected by one `` s attitude including love and hate .this is one of the defects of ideas .they express the feeling of person .no one of the people is ideal .this makes ideas full of mistakes .but even of being so , person can be learned how to give true ideas .this requires alot of experience .one of the best idealists i heard about is socrate .his ideas are very near to facts that can be considered as lessons for any one who like to learn how to think .last advantage of studying ideas is the freedom .a human is considered free to give an opinion whatever it is .but it is not allowed to change facts
