people who live and work in big cities have to deal with traffic .it may take even more than a few hours of their lives everyday .if there were fewer cars , the problem would be solved .but how to decrease the number of cars ?the solution is mass transportation .i believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there is today .the city planners are working on new roads as well as new ways of mass transportation .especially underground or lightweight railway systems are getting popular .when the quality and the number of these mass transportations increase , there will be less need for cars .the cars are causing air and noise pollution all around the world .the hybrid cars are being developed but not being used .on the other hand , new mass transportation vehicles are not polluting the world .mass transportation is economical as well .it contributes to national economy as well as household economy .the fuel energy cars are using and the time spent in traffic are bad for national and international economy .the world is going through an important phase concerning world peace .the wars started for gaining the use of petrolium are increasing rapidly in the middle east .these wars are started because of petrolium corperations and their urges to have more power .the companies are also pressurising the governments to increase the building of roads and selling of cars .if people and governmeni believe that people and the governments will come to an understanding that mass transportation is a must for the whole world .mass transportation will improve world economy , decrease pollution and traffic .
