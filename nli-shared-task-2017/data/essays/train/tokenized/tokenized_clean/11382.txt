a famous saying goes , `` everything has two sides  .depending on personal experience , personality type and emtional concern , i realize that some people hold an idea that young people s lives are more joyful than older perople s , meanwhile others prefer the other side of this point .in my opinion , young people truely does have more joyful life than older people .in the following discussion , i would like to provide three conspicuous aspects to support my view point .in the first place , young people has more `` toys  to play with .computers , play statioins , xboxes , are all favorite things for teengers even children .however , older people even do not know what are these `` wired mechines  use for .for example , one time , i was playing games on my computer , my little sister came to me and asked me to let her play for awhile .she did a good job on playing with it .in contrast , when my grandpa came to me , he thought i was watching movies on my computer .because of the learning speed of older people is respectively slow compared to younger people , so their ability of enjoying life decreases a lot .in short , young people has more high technology `` toys  to play to make their life happier than older people do .moreover , young people have more friends than older people has .teengers are like to express their opinions with each other and they do not hide things with their friends , so they enjoy life more than older people do .however , based on the ability of communication skills , older people are unable to in touch with huge numbers of friends .as a consequence , they are lack of friendship .hence , few friends make older people unable to enjoy life more than young people do .lastly , the willing of some exciting advantures of teengers are higher than older people .almost every teengers are like travelling because they want to explore some exciting advantages .nevertheless , older people have given these kinds of willings up long time before just because they are busy about their work and their energy is limited .therefore , teengers excitements drive them to become more happier .to sum up , by listing three factors that i discussed above which sometimes they intertwine to become an organic whole and thus become more persuasive .we can safely reach the conclusion that young people truely have a happier life than older people have .
