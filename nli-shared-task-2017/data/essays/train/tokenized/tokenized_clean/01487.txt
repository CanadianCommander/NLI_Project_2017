in recent years , the knowledge of ideas and concepts have become increasingly important in school curricula whereas the learning of facts has decreased in importance .at first sight , this makes a lot of sense : the knowledge of ideas and concepts gives people the ability to deal with new situations and new facts .with the fast changes in modern life that stem from technical developments but also from economic influences and changes within a society or culture as such , dealing with and adjusting to new situations and developments becomes an important skill to have .especially when facts become out-dated very fast .nevertheless , the natural sciences as well as history depend on the knowledge of facts and so do , maybe to a lesser extent , cultural studies and humanities in general .of course , it can easily be argued that facts can be looked up today without any major difficulty .especially with the increased use of the internet , to actually know facts might seem less and less important .but then again , people need facts in their daily work : doctors need to know human anatomy , or the features of illnesses to work successfully .but facts only make sense when they are embedded in a greater context that is provided by the knowledge of concepts and ideas .a fact is `` useless  in a sense when it can not be judged adequately in light of an idea .there is no real need for a person to know when a writer was born or died when he or she can not place the writer `` s work in a greater cultural context or concept .at the same time , there is not much use in knowing literary concepts and ideas without knowing when a certain writer lived to connect him or her to those concepts .in the end , concepts and ideas are not everything , but neither are facts .both depend on each other in many ways .really , the discussion should not be about rating these two things in importance but finding a good way of combining both when teaching because both skills - the knowledge of facts as well as the knowledge of ideas and concepts - are closely interconnected .
