studants must understand ideas and concepts , on the other hand they must learn facts also .but the question is : what is better for them ???well as i see , learning facts is more important , becsause ideas and concepts depend on the person who give it to us , in another words , its may different from one person to other , so whats the reason of understand this ?on other hand facts , are as it is , in all the world , everytime and everywhere .for example ,  womes must work in order to help her husband  somebody agree , others do nt .well , sombody says she has to work because she is a human as her husband , so she must work outside home , not only her husband .others says , she is a woman if she worked outside maybe somebody will hit her or even do nt be faire with her because she is a lady .here is an idea the first reason is more powrfull than the other , so what we will gain if we study ideas ???but if we studied facts , such as theory of gravity .in this case we will improve our knowledge , know whats happen in the world and maybe we will take it for a research in order to get a depluma on physics or any other higher level .if we looked everywhere in colleges we will notice that almost of the study is studying facts .also , what is a student ??student is a person who study to graduate from a recognized college , recognized from all over the world , so how can he study idea or concept and being recognized ?recognized means that there is no doubt that he is right , so if he study a concept , what will happen if he is not on right way ??he will lose everything he did for nothing .and everybody has his own opinion .
