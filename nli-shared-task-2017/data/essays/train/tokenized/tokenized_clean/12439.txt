i agree about the passage that successful peole likes try new things and takes risk oterwise the others just doing one thing what they already know how to do well .i traveled over 10 countries by my self since i was university student .before trying to go to the other countries by my self , many people worry about some situation for dangerious and sickness .in addition to , i was scared try new one because of the unfamillier .neverthless , after i try the new experience and take risk by my self , i got more confidenceand new knowledge .when i was highschool student , i read the book about woman travel all over countries by her self over 10 years .the author whose name is biya han overcome many risks and fight against the society s prejudice .in early korea society was so conservative , for the reason of that waman ca nt travel by themselves .besides in her age of 30 , travel by herself without marriage considered crazy idea .hoever she broke the rule , and she become successful traveler .i admired her , so i try to take risks and travel by myself .from the experience i got so many experinces for example .sllep in the street without money , walking 7 days by myself and meet many friends came from different countries .after that experiences , i got confidence and belive i can do everything .secondly , people can get many knowledges try new things .i did nt know that makes the fire , speaking english eventhough i could nt read the map before i traveling .i learn many valuable knowledge from the travel , so i decided the study more in america .if i did nt go to travel by myself i never know how important to learn new language and meet variety people .
