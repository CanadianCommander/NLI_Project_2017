as you all know many students choose to learn what it is written in their books rather to see the main idea behind it .this leads to developing generations , who waits for others to think and accept their ideas as a truth without questioning it .so it is very importent for young people to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .firstly , when you are taking a math class or any other subject related to science you have to learn the main principles of the subject in order to succeed .for example you can not just say something falls down when it is dropped .you have to know that there is an external force called gravity , which keeps all subjects on the ground or make them fall when they are in the air .without understanding the main reason or thinking about the cause you can not make any progress for yourself and the others .secondly , it is not only true that someone should learn the main ideas for the science related subjects .also in other areas like history or politics ( especially in politics ) you should know the reason why something happened or going to happen .unfortunetlly many students believe that history is only about learning wars or important charecters in order , but history is more than that .without the background information on the facts , for example the wwii , you will never understand why the americans have to go into europe in order to support england .in this example it is important to understand that england was the only country against the nazi-germany and needed help in order to prevent the groth of nazi-era , but without this information it will be just another war in the human history .finally many students say that they have many thinks to learn and to understand the idea behind everything requires much time , but that is only a misunderstanding .especially in engineering subjects , such as programming , you can not learn every single command , because there are to many of them !the main points of programming is to know how to build an algorithm and how to translate it into the programming language needed .the rest can be done by everyone with a little experience in computers .to sum up , facts are nothing compared to the ideas behind them .in order to take an important part in the society people should produce their own ideas , otherwise they will be nothing more than a slave .in order to do that you need to understand the main ideas .
