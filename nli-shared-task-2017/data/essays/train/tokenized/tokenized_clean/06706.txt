i think it is true that the younger people enjoy more of their life than the older people do .and i have three points to support with .first , younger age is `` free  .except going to school and doing homeworks , young people have more time than the elders .considering `` adults  spending time with anything regarding their jobs , such as meetings and getting ready for the presentations or even raising children , it is obvious that young people have more time than the older people do .second , young people have less to worry about .new house , paying taxes , promotions , raising children .these are none of the options that younger people would have in mind to consider .the few things they might think of would be boy/girlfriends , schoolworks , college or getting jobs even .except few groups of peole who take them too seriously , those are not desperately important or i should say `` deep  matters .comparing to those of adults , young people have less things to concern , which help them to enjoy their time even more .third , and for the last , young people is literally `` young  .they have more chances to try out for many things .for example , the adults usually do nt get chances to try out for musical or sport team if their major or fields are different .but in middle or high school , or even in college , young people get lots of chance to try a bit of everything , so to speak .and i think the more you try , there s more possibilities that you ll like , and have a good time .so for these three reasons , i think young people have more chances to , and do enjoy life more than older people do .
