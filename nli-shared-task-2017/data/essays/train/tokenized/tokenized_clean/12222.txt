contemporary world demands a wide repertoir of skills and a reasonable fund of knowledge to enjoy the comforts and facilities afforded by advances in science and technology .i agree with the idea that it is preferable to have a broad base of many academic subjects rather than having specialized knowledge in a narrow specific subject .i would like to substantiate my point of view in this essay .there has been an unprecedented explosion of knowledge in the recent decades - it is impossible for any single individual to master any field .in the same breath , the advances are so profound and far reaching that knowledge has no subject boundaries any more .a specialist in a specific field can not contribute at the periphery of his subject area unless he knows about other subjects that interlink with it .for example , physicians who wish to deal with genetic diseases can not function efficiently unless they have good back ground in genetics and biochemistry , two closely related subjects .similarly the advances in gene unravelling would not be possible if computer scientists and geneticists had strictly compartmental training .bio-informatics is a new field emerging to support and solidify the biological information with the help of computer technology .one can quote endless examples : the advent cat scan is an engineering marvel that yields invaluable information to the treating physicians about the interior of body .use of computer and internet is an insepetable feature of our daily life , which is not possible without learning computers .being a great scientist would not suffice - one should be trained in the social sciences too - sociology , psychology and economics .most north american universities support this view by encouraging students to have a graduate degree ( of any subjects ) before one can apply to the med school .most other parts of the world seem to be following the same trend , and a variety of new courses with innovative subject combinations are on the horizon .with such developments it would be easy to find students with a broad based general information and a few of them with intensive knowledge in specific fields , like an astronomer trained in music and enjoying his piano in the space !
