a company s main purpose is to create a product that will sell no matter what ; at least that is our common knowledge .fortunately , there are also many companies who believe in making a great product that will be eficient and meet the needs of their buyers .still it is not known which happens the most , but it is quite obvious that in either case they use advertising to sell their product .it is pesimistic to say that most companies lie to their propective buyers to get them to buy their product through great advertising , but it is somewhat true .there are those that sell their product as it is , and others that sell it by painting it better than what they really are .i ve actually been exposed to both types of advertising and can say that i ve felt cheated by the second one .who has nt yearn to buy one of those miracle creams shown on tv ?those that remove scars or make your breasts grow , at least that is what the `` users  say on tv .yet , not everyone has bought them because they know better than to be fooled by those ads .unfortunately , i was fooled .i bought a cream that would remove stretch marks , and was obviously disappointed when three weeks later i saw no results so i gave my dermatologist a visit where he told me that there was no cream that would remove them .this advertisings are quite misleading and always make you waste your money , especially to those of us who does nt have money to spare .luckily , i have also bought products that have achieved what they promised on their adevertismentes .m & m s ads guarantee that they ll melt in your mouth and not in your hand , and they certainly do melt in my mouth .likewise , a new so called `` vanish poder o2  which promises that it will remove almost every stain off your clothes , really does .once i took my cousins favorite white jacket without her permission , and obviously i had to drip some blackberry icecream on it .i got to her house very quickly and told her maid to clean it for me .two hours later , the jacket was completely whiten by `` vanish poder o2  .i can not say i blame companies to lie on their ads so people will buy their products , because i have also painted myself a few times better than what i really am , not by saying huge lies , just by improving a few defects .still , i hate to feel ashamed for believing those companies , but not enough to damage my belief that not all companies are like me .
