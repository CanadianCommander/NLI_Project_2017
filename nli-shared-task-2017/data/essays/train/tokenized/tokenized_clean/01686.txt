this topic has a two way answer .mankind has alway s been known to thrive above any species .man has always been the dominating factor in this life .when a man is successful , he could have anything he wants .some people are afraid when it comes to taking risk s , because it might jeapordise their current financial position .some successful people like to try new thing s because it would be an adventure , it would be fun and it might just ` work  .a person should only take the risk if he feels that he is one hundred percent sure that its fool proof , by saying this word i am contradicting the word ` risk  , which is why a person can never be too careful .although taking a risk may seem breath-taking , it sometimes is devestative , one small risk could send a person down in flame s , sending him to the abyss if he is not too careful .if i were a successful person i would like to experiment , take my chances , live life while im still alive , embrace failure as i would success .although disagreeing with the statement would sound more reasonable , i d like to agree with it , a time will come when a person is going to have to take a risk , be it a big one or a small one .
