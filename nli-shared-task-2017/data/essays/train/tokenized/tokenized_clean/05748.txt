i dont agree with the statement .the first reason is that there are no other transportation better than cars .cars are acctually covenient .from door to door we can go anywhere we want .especially with a big baggage or small child .no one disturb us in the car .so there are few persons who want to give up drive with their cars .on the other hand , we have many problem with cars .for example , traffic jams and dificulty of findind parking .as the increasing of car , those kind of problem became bigger than before , still , i do nt think it will cause people give up driving cars .this kind of disadvantage is tolerable .the advantage of using cars are bigger , and there may be energic problem to cars .the oil stock will be exhausted in near futuer , but , to my mind , industrial progress will give us other energic power such as water or sollar power to move cars .therefore this shortcoming of using car will not have good reason .then , how about other transportation ?as for trains , the ll cost a lot to make rails and keep land .plains also cost to move on .car is conpact and flexible .in additon , the second reason i think we will continue to use cars are that cars are someway have role as our fasion .many people are euthusiastic to chose one s car .having car is a kind of status of people .so , nevertheless some more convenient and smart machines are prevented , we are using cars more and more .and i do nt think no other transportation which fit people better than cars will be prevent in twenty years .
