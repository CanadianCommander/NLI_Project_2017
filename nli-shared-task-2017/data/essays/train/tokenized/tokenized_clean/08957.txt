i strongly agree with the statement that great people take risks and accept new challenges in order to achieve great things .since great achievements mostly do not come by in accidents or at no cost , in order to make achievments , people need to assume the necessary risks and challenges involved .many supporting examples can be found in successful business men and scientists .the most widely known and cited example of a successful business man is probably bill gates .he is the father of the most widely utilized softward affecting millions of population around the globe .however , many doubt whether this could have been possible had bill gates decided to continue his study .rather , many ascribe his success to his daring initiative to drop out of college and start his own career as a programmer in the early stage of his life .by trying new things and assuming risks , bill gates did to achieve great things that many people aspire .the most genious and creative inventors the world has ever observed so far , leonardo davinci , has also assumed certain risks and challenges that were necessary to his great achievments .according to historians , davinci was widely criticized and mocked by people when he first attempted to fly the air .being a completely new idea back then , most people considered this ingenious invention unrealistic .despite the circumstances , davinci continued on with his project and is nowadays regarded as the greatest inventor of all times .in summary , history and current events attest to the claim that successful people try new things and take risks in order to make great achievements .bill gates had to assume considerable amount of risk when he decided to quit college and start his own career early .leonardo davinci had also confronted new challenges when he decided to attempt at flying .
