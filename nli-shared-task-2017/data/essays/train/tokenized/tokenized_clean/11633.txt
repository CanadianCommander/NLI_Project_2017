people have different opinions about traveling .some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour giude while others do not .they have their own reasons to choose what they think is the best for them .personally , i agree with the poeple who are saying that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because this kind of traveling has many advantages .first of all , a group led by a tour guide will have more fun and enjoynment than a group that is not led by a tour guide .a tour guide will save the tourists  time and make every possible effort to make sure that the tourists are enjoying their tours .also , at our guide is very fimiliar with the historical places because the tour guide is from the place to which the tourists are traveling .during the tour , the tourists will revieve some information that are given the tour guide about the historical places .however , people who are traveling without a tour guide will find it difficult to find the places in which they want to be .in a group which is led by a tour guide , one will find an opportunity to know the other tourists who are in the same tour .it is obvious to us that we will get more benefits when we choose a group tour .we can see how importance is the tour guide for the tourists during their tours .following a tour guide , the tourists will benefit from every moment in their tours .in fact , there are many advantages from being in a group led by a tour guide while there are no disadvantages from being in a group led by a tour guide .
