is innovation exclusive for succesful people ?or so i would call my essay , as the way the exam question is phrased i could call two different answers :yes , successful people try new things indeed , since they have the chance - sometime this represents a budget to play with - to do so .in our current world state in its ever-defining processes-for-everthing mania , the chance lies for certain individuals to look at things from a different angle .the innovation chance comes naturally to mature individuals and mature companies , since those are the ones that understand ( through living ) that a mature process produces predictive results .given a experience-driven and refined process for making software it is possible for an indian consulting company to predict how long will it take to develop a project , how much time the risks will take away from it and how much resources should it allocate to get the project going .its due to a mature set of processes that companies like bimbo can do just-in-time deliveries to every convenience store in its city .it is after embracing such level of maturity that an individual or a company can find room for improvement , room for trying different ways and expect different results .and , as i would call that level of maturity a certain degree of success i agree to the proposed statement .for my second answer however , i can answer `` no  , for it is not an exclusive habit , as sometimes emerging little companies and individuals , virtually no-ones in the business world need a more agressive strategy .for these companies and individuals that have perhaps spoted a new target market or developed a brand new product , there s no time to be doing things the long-term way , sometimes fail-proof or tested .sometimes there is no room for mature processes where time is crucial , for these kind of individuals or companies , subject to these kind of conditions , is that i agree with the risk-taking deal , even when they know nothing of how to make something work and they have to start something from scratch .
