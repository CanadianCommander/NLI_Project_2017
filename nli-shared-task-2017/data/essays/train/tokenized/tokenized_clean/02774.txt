a lot of people specialize themseves in one specific subject at university and take corses in the same department in order to have degrees in a particular field .we can wonder if it is good to have a specialized knowledge or a broad one .having a specialized knowledge on an academic subject could be great if it is in the view of being a researcher , a specialist or a technician in a certain field .moreover , it is easier to concentrate on one specific subject during studies and it is easier being more known because specialist of some subject are rare .for example , it is rare to find a specialist in treatments water process and so some people who are could have more chances to find a job after graduation .to the opposite , having an overview of sciences and some knowledge about religions and phylosophy is necessary in every day life and also because some fields could cross others .for example , taking course about both politics and economics is better to understand the way a country goes .it is also very important to discover things in order to know what it seems to be the more interesting and which correspond the most to a personnality .according to me , the best is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects at the beginning of the scholarship and to specialize at the end .it is like that the american universities work and i think it is better than in france because people are too specialized .in united states students must have credits from others departments they are studying in in order to have an awarness and a culture more important and so they can compare and choose a field in which they are interested in in order to specialize themselves after .
