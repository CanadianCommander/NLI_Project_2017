nowadays , there are more and more advertisements showing on tv , magzines , and other media .as a result , people increasingly depend on advertisements to know certain products .i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisers often make appearence of goods more beautiful than they really are .for example , i often buy clothes through internet .i found the fact that clothes does not have same color and style as it was shown on internet .this often makes me angry .another example , many houses are advertised through media .some houses looks more acceptable than they really do , with lovely shape and beautiful color .however , when you go to see the true house , it is not the same appearence as it looks like on advertisement .also , for the purpose of attracting more buyers , advertisements make products seem much convenient than they really are .for example , sellers advertise for the cars .most of advertisements show that owing a car is a symbol of high level living condition .there is often a scene on the tv that whole family go to beautiful nature park for camping happily and wealthily , of course , a luxurious car always exists in the background .however , this advertisement does not consider the side effect of cars such as sending out smog and making noise .also , family may spend much on gasoline and repair fees .in sum , since most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , as buyers , we should pay attention to and try to adoid this problem .also , i advocate for true advertisement which can give the reliable information on goods .
