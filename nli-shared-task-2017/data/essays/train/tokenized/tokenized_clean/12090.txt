i strongly agree with the given statement .i think we usually misleaded by some advertisements or commercials .there are many example for supporting my perspectives .first of all , componies always want to promot their product for maximize their profit .we can see many kinds of diet pill advertisements on magzine or commercials on telvesion .the advertisements always said the diet pill can really works dramatically , but after people buy and use it , they feel they have cheated .because many componies just want a good marketing for their products .they do not really care customers , even overexaggrating their products .additionally , the advertisement have to show advantages of the product , it will never said anything about disadvantages .we usually see some body-building machine on telvesion commercial .however , we also see many our friends bought a body-building machine , but did not really use it .they often realized that machine is too big or
