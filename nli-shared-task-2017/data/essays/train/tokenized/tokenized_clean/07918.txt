whether to be a person who is equiped with plenty of knowledge from all kinds of academic subjects or just to be a professor in one field is not a straighforward issue .everyone keeps a unic opinion on it .while it comes to me , i would say that to be a professor is more beneficial .first of all , people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all categories of fields , which does good to our advanced education .energy , just like time for human , is limited .with these limited energy , one can do what he or she likes to do .but , once distributed to too many subjected , people ca nt be a professor in a certain field .for example , we know that teachers in the elemental school can teach almost all the courses that are provided .however , if the child grows up and enter a college , no one can be responsible for all the classes .what he or she need is a professor who know a lot in a particular subject , not a teacher with many knowledge from different subjects .in addition , people with a great number of knowledge in some special field help solve the social problems .take the development of science reseaches for an example .without the technology brought by science research , we ca nt live such comfortable lives today , we will still suffer from the deseases , hungry and disasters .without science researches , we ca nt explain nature phenomenons and the secret of the universe .nevertheless , who are mostly responsible for these researches ?they re our scientists , most of whom are experts from different fields .admittedly , to acquire as much knowledge as possible from different subjects is advisable , because it can help people to know the world outside us as a whole pictures .nevertheless , to have as much knowledge as possible in a certain field can benefit ourselves much more .to sum up , i think it is better to obtain much knowledge in one particular subject .
