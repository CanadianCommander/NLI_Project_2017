life is so diverse , that as much as a person learns throughout his/her life , there is always more .there does not exist a limit for learning , and new discoveries and creations pop up daily in our everyday news , growing in a parallel mode with the ever imrpoving technology .as a matter of fact , a successful person is not one who knows a lot , but one who knows how , when and where to apply his/her knowledge in the best way available .a person who has mastered something ( x ) he/she does , is automatically better qualified to do and improve ( x ) than someone who has never seen or heard about it .each human being has specific characteristics and environmental cultures that bound his/her ability of the things he/she has learned .sometimes , these limits are highly disadvantageous , yet they would not make this person specifically unsuccessful , because with the right knowledge at one specific task , he/she can sublime in a way even the best educated person on the globe could not .on the other hand , trying new things and taking new risks are very important in today s world , but it does not yet make it more successful a person who does it than one who does not .in fact , innovations and risks should always be tried for newly developed ideas and for the person to improve his/her skills and learn about most things a little .this concept is very well illustrated when compared to how the agricultural revolution evolved as an example .imagine if a farmer would have to plant all types of fruits and vegetable , that at the end would barely be sufficient for his family survival in contrast to every one farmer specializing in a specific fruit or vegetable and than barter and trade with the others .like that , each one farmer would definitely profit more with the specialization , and as a result also consume the best quality goods altogether .this shows that sometimes it is also benefitial to specialize in a specific ability to have the best results , because if everyone would like to do everything by himself the world would not go on .now again , this does not mean that having some overall knowledge would be harmful .in conclusion , a successful person is a rather relative term .because success can be attained with hard-work and loyalty to a goal .no matter the amount of risks and innovations taken , specializing yourself can be equally granted .have you ever imagined if professional athletes stopped playing basketball , football , or baseball , would they still be successful ?
