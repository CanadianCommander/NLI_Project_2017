advertisements are made for the sole purpose of increasing customer purchase .the goal of advertisement itself makes it inevitable for advertisements to make products seem better than they really are .in an memoir by a former copy writer augusten burroghs , the author looks back on his experience in the advertisement field and describes how he felt disgusted when he was forced to create a fake image around a product .he was assigned to make an advertisement for a shampoo .his copy told people that the shampoo will give your hair full body and make it look like silk .the truth was , consumers in the sample group complained that the shampoo smelled like bubble gum and made their hair greasy .in this case , the advertisement was clearly portraying a false feature of the product .another method that advertisers use to make products seem better is artificially creating images around the product .an example is an budwiser advertisement .the advertisement displayed images of young women and men in their twenties , holding a bottle of beer in their hands and dancing , looking as if they were having the best time of their lives .all the women and men in the advertisement were gorgeous and were portraryed as if they had no worries at all .this advertisement connects the euphoric image of youth with a bottle of beer .research does show that alcohol generally elevates mood slightly .however , there are serious side affects of drinking alcohol that are not portrayed in this advertisement .for example , severe drinking is not good for your health and in some cases , may even jepordize your life .also , drinking may lead to judgement impairment and many drunk people make mistates which they would have not made if they were in a more conscious state .the problem with this advertisement is that it is not portraying any of these negative consequences of drinking .as consumers , we should be critical about the advertisements that we see .the purpose of advertisements is to persuade us to buy products and persuasion works by only showing the positive aspects of a product which may even be fake in some cases .it is critical to consider the negative aspects of the product that the advertisements are not showing us .by doing so , consumer will be able to make better purchase decisions .
