in my opinion , the statement that successful people try new things and take risks is true .my believe is that success and new things are closely related .i do think so because in my experience i always considered something as a personal success if i was able to overcome old barriers and to reach targets that seemed unlikely to be reached before .i feel especially satisfied , if by reaching new targets i have to face risks .on the other hand if something is well known to me , i do not feel great satisfaction in achieving it .so for me it is part of personal success to try in new things and overcome risks .also in a material way i think that it is true that success goes along with trying new things and taking risks .there are many examples of great personalities who are regareded successful because they were the first to do certain things .for example lance armstrong who was the first man on the moon is definetly considered to be a successful man .another example would be a business-man who managed to built up a company that provides unique and new products or services .if his company offers usefull stuff and is the first to do so , the chances of being successful are quite high .of course , there is also another side of success .if someone has certain targets that are not necessarily new or ground-breaking , you can also be successful by reaching these targets .you could for example try to play soccer as good as some famous soccer player .if you manage to do so , you might be a successful person without achieving a new thing .but in my opinion it is more likely to become sucessful by doing something new rather than just to do like others did before .in conclusion , even though it is not a necessarity to try new things in order to become successful , i do believe that by doing so you will have a greater chance to become successful in the way you feel about yourself and in the way other people see you .
