i agree with this topic .there are so many people and communities in this world .community is the one of the most important things in our life .however , it has been changing thesedays .there are some of my opinions .first , i heard that the people whose age is over than middle age have helped their communities , since they were teenager .it is good for human being because communities also helped them .what i would like to explain is that childlen were not raised by only their family , but also thier communities .young people nowadays want to be with friends rather their communities even their family .it sounds fun but they ca nt learn anyting from older people .they have been losing some oppotunity to be mature .unfortunatly , i have seen a lot of bad news done by teenager on tv nowadays .it means , the young people have been getting rude and impolite .it is not good when they have to be independent .as a conclusion , young people should have time to help thier communities , and learn a lot of things from older people .it will be good in this world .
