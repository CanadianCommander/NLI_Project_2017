in 2006 we are living in the world of mass media .i think it is not possible to escape from this situation .advertisements are directs products of this phenomenon , surely one of the most important and profitable parts .today advertisements are not only used to sell products or promoting business but even to advertise politicians during the elections .it gives us an idea of how big their effects could be .advertise to sell products is essential .many time we buy completely unuseful things only because they appear in the television .the majority of people considers , probably not conscionsly , a good product what they have seen advertised , indipendently from quality .it has happened also to me several times .advertisement tends to make products better than they are .some days ago , for example , i bought a very expensive profume only because it was advertised by my favorite actor , without taste it before .at the end i have discovered it was smelling very bed .i can add severel other examples .a special case can be food .food in television appears very coloured and looks very tasty , of course much nicer that the one cultivated by my grandparents in my house , but often the quality is really low .usually big companies have the power to advertise their products massively .it is vital for their image and , above all , for their profits .let the products know can be better than produce well .it makes money .to summarize , i think that advertisement has a big impact on the image of products , despite their quality .consequentelly it depends on final customers be aware of this potential problem .it is impossible nowaday not to be influenced by the advertisements , but i whis people will be more quality oriented in the future .
