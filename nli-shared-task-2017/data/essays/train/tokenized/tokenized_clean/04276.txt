young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .maybe .it s also true that nowadays communities that need to be helped are lots more than in the past .i think the main question is too big for being resumed in these two lines .young people , right now , is more dedicated in avoiding its own big problems such drugs , aids , racism and so on .describing the help a person can give to his community begins from the little .i can talk about my personal impressions and actions .in the city i live , milano , the helping attitude in general is so low , and people basically go on their own business .they do nt understand that giving help to someone may cost time , energy and can go over the rules .personally , i m training kids living in the suburbs doing graffiti , an art that know how to create without loosing the feeling of the street .sometimes what we do could seem wrong to someone else , but i know i m taking with me those kids and keeping them away from really wrong habits they could begin to have .what me and few friends do is not helped by no church , organization or organized groups : is something we do because we feel we can do something with those skills god gave us .is an action that goes little , dedicated , moving in the shadow : we just know that those kids will have something right , colourful and creative to do in their streets instead of beginning something wrong .beside that , every day is plenty of little but not less important occasions to helping people : giving your seat to someone more needful , bringing your old clothes to the local church , help someone crossing the streets .little by little .sometimes a smile can last for days , even if it s a glimpse .carlo .
