ofcourse , i agree with the statement that , `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the main point of an advertisement is to attract people into buying the product .to achieve that , the producers of the advertisement program go to any extent to make their product look outstanding .even if the good products are not advertised , they will be on sale but an average or a bad product do need a good advertisement to make itself appeal to the customer .what happens during the february end ?its the time for super bowl ads .these advertisements are worth about 10 million dollars .that s a lot of money into the ads but if the ads clicked in the `` people s  market , the owner of the ad would make lots of money .i was watching a television channel and there was an advertisement about a face clearing lotion .i asked my friend if she watched the advertisement .she said that she already bought the product which is worth about 20 dollars .but she was frustrated at the product because it made her skin look worse .in the advertisement , there were 3 average looking girls who tranformed their skin to an attractive one using this product .it was nothing like it appeared .few days back , i was in the mall trying to get some stuff for my soccer practice .i went to the modell s sporting goods , there was a packet with baseball cards on it .on the cover , there were about 10 cards , so i decided to buy it .i went to my house and opened the cover and found only 3 cards .i was very frustrated at this .although , its my fault , i felt it was nt right .in the above examples , it was evidenced that advertisements make products look better .there was a saying , `` not to judge a book by its cover .in the same way , we products seem much better in their advertisements .
