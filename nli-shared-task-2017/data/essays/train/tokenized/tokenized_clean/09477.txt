before discussing this statement , we have to think about what `` enjoying life  means .it could be simply `` having fun .if it is the case , we have to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .but i want to say that `` enjoying life  can be attained after we recognize `` the meaning of life .when we follow my own definition of `` enjoying life ,  then we can say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .young people may have fun during their school life by discussing topics that they newly discovered , traveling foreign countries or simply going out with friends .however i want to say that these experiences would be merely `` fun  rather than enjoying life .because `` life  is such a serious thing , it will take time for young people to recognize the meaning of life .also , young people are busy and poor .they have too much things to do to prepare for the future .they do nt have enough money to spend to enjoy .older people , on the other hand , through their abundant experience , would get their own idea of `` life .only after they have some idea of life , they will think about what would enjoying their lives mean .it could be helping others , reading books and discuss about , or travel to diffenent countries .but their experiences would not merely fun .we could say these experiences are `` enjoying lives .facinating thing for older people would be that they have time and money to spend for enjoying their lives .as a conclusion , i would like to say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .so i disagree with the statement .
