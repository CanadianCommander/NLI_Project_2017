there are a lot of theories on the number of cars that are in use now and that would be in use in the next future .experts have different ideas on this question , and their theories are based principally on the cost of cars ( including the fuel , the insurance , etc . )and of governments  policies .in my opinion , if things do not change quickly , in the next twenty years in italy there would be fewer cars in use than today .my first argument is that cars  cost is increased year by year in the last times .even if cars  prices are not increased , the cost of the fuel and of insuraces is now at an incredibly high level .for example , the last government s law , in order to solve the financial problem of our country , contains a special tax on suvs .today , a tipical italian family can difficulty afford the cost of a car .in addition , the local policies of the cities are other reasons for not buy a car .now in all the big cities there are traffic limitation , and , in order to try to reduce pollution , in some days cars are not allowed to move in the cities .furthermore , old cars can not circulate at any time during the day .also , in the cities is very difficult to find a parking and , when one finds it , it costs a lot of money .therefore people prefers to go to the cities with scooters , that take less space , or with public transports , which are cheaper .however , the italian government is not giving a real alternative to the car for people that need to move for work or for other reasons .the public transports do not cover all people s necessities .for instance , there are no buses during the night so , if one wants to go out at nightime , he or she has to use a private mean .in conclusion , because most families can not afford a car , and because cars are not useful if one can not use them ( like it happens with cities  limitations ) , i think that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .however , government policy is not helping to resolve the situation in favour of public transports .
