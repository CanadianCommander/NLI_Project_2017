nowadays , with our capitalistic way of thinking , and our huge ideology of research for wealth , it has become a common concern to seek for the best way to be succesful .thus , many people argue that it is easier to be successful running risks or trying new things .actually , we can not denied that taking risk can lead to success .because finding new things is obviously the best way to give to the people new need ( for economy ) , and also to anticipate your competitors .marcel bleustein , for example , became one of the most famous french advertisors , being the first one to try to do advertising on radio .one another hand , trying new things lead you to take risks , and becoming unsuccessful if nobody takes care of your idea .however , it is also possible to be successful only doing what you know how to do well .the principle is that , if you know perfectly how to do something , you will consequently do it on a better way that your concurrents .the big americane telephone compagny at & t , for example , prefered in the 20s continue to be the best in the telephone technologie , rather than developpe new technologies such as wireless telegraph .as everybody knows , it was a good choice .actually , the best way to be successful may be both doing something we know well , and trying to find new things .in art for example , it is diffucult to be a real artist , that is to say to create new things , without be aware of what existed before .that is why , before becoming one of the most famous french movie director and one of the leader of the nouvelle vague , j. l. gaudard firstly worked hard to know a lot of things about classical cinema and more generally about classical art .
