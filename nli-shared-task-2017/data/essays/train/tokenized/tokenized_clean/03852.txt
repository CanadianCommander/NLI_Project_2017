unfortunately , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays life has become very complicated and exhaustive , not only for adults but also for young people .there is a lot of competition in every field .the young generation is so occupied by their own lives that they hardly have any time for community services .students have to work much harder compared to our parents in order to be successful in their life .a lot of the time has to be devoted for studying .a good education is given much more importance than earlier .secondly there are many more recreational activities nowadays .with the invention of high-tech video games , computer games like the sony playstations and x-box the level of entertainment has reached a whole new level .then there is television and internet on which you can view an unlimited amount of things twenty four hours a day .for sports fans there are various sorts channels like espn and star sports on which a large number of sports are covered ranging form cricket to baseball .the young people spend a lot of time on the internet chating , e-mailing etc .people would rather spend time enjoying and entertaining themselves instead of helping others .the young generation is selfish and ignores the needs of the community .they are more concerned about there future and do not care about the community s future .they do not understand the importance of a good community .therefore i agree with the statement .
