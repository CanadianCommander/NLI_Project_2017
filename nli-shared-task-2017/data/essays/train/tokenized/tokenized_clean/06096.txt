it my belife that whole purpose of education is to train the mind to appreciate , comprehend and eventually implement new ideas and thoughts that come along through the course of one s life .hence , it is essentail not only to understand ideas but to have a will to try and understand ideas .unfortunately , we now live in the `` techno-age  , where is it prime only to deliver , irrespective of how you got to the end result .results are of paramount importance as people and businesses have lesser time to spare on details and subtleties .however , to deliver results effectively and efficiently is it important to know the facts , and to know them well .let me try and demonstrate this using the following example .a students sits-up all night studying for an exam on the ` indian struggle for freedom  .she feels passionately for the subject , understands the emotions at play and reasons due to which one event led to another .but , on the day of her exam , she is stunned when she looks at the question paper .she has been asked questions requirring her to state dates of important events and names of revolutionaries .she however , was so mesmerized by the determination of the revolutionaries , that she forgot to memorize their names !now , although she maybe able describe the freedom struggle as a story , her description will be inaccurate , leading to a low score on the paper .in conclusion , i d like to say that , although learning facts can be as or more difficult than understanding ideas , it is important to be able to do both .i will go a step further and say that , today everyone is expected to understand ideas and concepts .what differentiates a winning student from the others is the knowledge of hard facts and a knowledge of how to implement them .
