the very word enjoyment can be inferred differently by diffrent people .each and very person has his own perspective about life and thus on things enjoyable .but , considering young and old as two groups of people .rather than group of unique individuals we can mention generally and not with convection who enjoys more .when people are young they have a lot of vigor and curiosity for life alltogether .this can be reflected in there activities as compared to the old .if you take for example , a teenager is more likely to have a funfilled action packed day than an older person .if a person does more stuff in a day , say work for that matter and he likes it he is enjoying .also , when you are young you have lot to do .a young person has not lived as much as half of the elderly .a young person has lot to enjoy .but , the elderly have gone through the whole thing and dont find it interesting or are altogether out of place for enjoying the stuff .the most important factor is that the elderly are not healthy and this imposes a few restrictions .i dont think an old guy would love to go trekking with his grandson .even if he loves to , he possible can not do it practically .so , this indirectly restricts the options available with them and thus restricts there enjoyment sources .the problem mentioned above also affects the elderly pshchologically .they develope a certain pessimistic attitude .even if they can , you wont find them getting indulged into activities .lets consider that they do participate .but , this too will be on a self concious basis and they wont be able to let go completely .so considering all the above factors and even though you consider a few exceptions .it is very clear that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .as , even though older people may have the intent to but the are not capable , because of the above mentioned reasons .
