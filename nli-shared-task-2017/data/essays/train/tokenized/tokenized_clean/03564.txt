opting for general academic knowledge instead of a more specific one is a defining choice .it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the student s future professional career .while broad knowledge is often prefered , i personally think that focusing on specific topics is more relevant .indeed , i am convinced that it is essential in order to become competent in a field .moreover , a freshly graduate student with very specific skills is more likely to match an employer expectations .nevertheless , in the particular case of management , broader knowledge is still preferable .first and foremost , going deep into a subject allows students to master perfectly a field , while surfacing it results in the end in useless skills .by tackling everything , we finally stop working on a subject when it is getting interesting .for instance , in high school , we discover many things : just enough to have a vague understanding of how things work .i would have loved to go further on biology , physics . ..but we lacked time .in order to go further on a subject , making a choice is needed .then , i think that a student who is specialized will better fit a company needs than if he had general background academic knowledge .indeed , in the modern industry , what is needed is very focused people , working on tiny tasks .the gathering of those tiny tasks , with each of them perfectly performed , makes the final result great .for instance , a friend of mine was specialized in micro frequence wave lengths , or close .he had no difficulty to be hired for a top level position in a military company because his profile was very rare .finally , i would underline the fact that there is one field where broad competences are better : management .as a matter of fact , what a manager is asked for is not doing things well .he is expected to be able to make his team deliver a great job .so he should understand the tasks of each of his teammates in order to manage them properly .the higher his position , the broader his skills .for instance it would be a non sense to ask a ceo in a pharmaceutical company to having very deep knowledge of drugs composition .to conclude , i would say that having a specific approach is a winning solution for any student .then , if he is to reach managerial positions , he will have the opportunity to get an mba in order to learn broader things for instance .| more competent : surfacing topics vs having an in6deep knozledge .zith broad learnings : stop zhen it starts getting interesting .specialized : today co ; panies , research specific knowledge for efficiencythe exception : management .need to be able to anyone and understand
