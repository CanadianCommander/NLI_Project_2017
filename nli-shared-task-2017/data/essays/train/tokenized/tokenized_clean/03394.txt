young people can enjoy life more than older people do , i agree with this statement but it is not true in some cases .the reasons people who enjoy life in young age and old age .1.they doesnt know the value of money .if they think how money comes in life few supports to enjoy and few them or not 2 .they feel that we cant enjoy if we become old but unfortunatly it is practically proved that it is true .for example im 24 years and my father is 45 years old he wants to enjoy the life more than me and he have lot of money to enjoy the life more but he feels that he is not young .3.it depends on the people mentality how they behave and how they want and how they like .but in my case i like to enjoy but i think about money .4.some people have money and all but they are not intrested to spend time and money with friends and others .they think that there is no difference for enjoy ment in ages .5. few people those who follow with the latest traditions , cultures they like to enjoy the life even though they are old .6. in my personal opinion enyoing the life is depend on how we think about life enjoyment it is not related to ages .7. people who think life is very short they like to enjoy in young age .8. people who are thinking about life experience they never like to enjoy life .9. people enjoy in life in old age is my grand father he works and enjoys alot in young age and enjoy now in old age .10. i feel my family is the best example for this .finally i concluded that eyoung people enjoy life more than older people do .
