the statement which attests that young people enjoy life more than older people is a controversory one .this because , some are for and others are against .from my point of view , it s true because when people are young , they have vo many things to do .i mean no many charges because if you do nt have a wife and children , you can enjoy life because when all these things will come , you will be obliged to reduce or to stop .young people are doing it because they are healthy , strong so they want to take profit of it before that it comes impossible .for them , at this period everything is permitted but when you will be at a certain level , it will be impossible to do certains things because of social position , because of your family and because you are becoming older , what normally means you have to be wise .we have to notice that it s not every young people that enjoy life because some of them are responsible and know that life is a treasure with with we should not play .generally , older people do nt enjoy life because they said they have already sawn what young people are doing .they will also say that they are old for these kind of things and as old as they are , it s not permitted to her to do certain things and because they have respect for their family .but sometimes , some of these older people are doing like young people , saying that nowadays life is nt long so they have to profit .after examining this subject , we can say that more people enjoy life but some of older people do it also .it a question of principle like us .
