sucess also contains risks . ..why that is so ?the example is straightforward sucess requires optimal conditions .although there may be a number prerequisets for it , in this brief paper , i will discuss two of them . ..one of them is effort and it inevitably contains risks .in order to become a successful academician one should work really hard .in a simplistic manner , he or she should spend lots of time for her or his studies .this might automatically , risks the family life of that person since she or he would not have enough time for the family members .there could be ceratin risks such as arguments about unfinished duties of that person .even though it is an interpersonal level of analysis , it is clear that this situation requires certain adaptations for everyone .the student for instance have to learn effective working strategies in a more limitted time .it is certainly something different and new ( as compared to the days of less responsibility , for instance ) .one other important prerequiset is being innovative .remember the scientist who were killed because of their ` new  ideas .a person who would like to be innovative should accept the risks . ..an academician for whose ideas does not suit with the conventions of the department he or she works for , might be an example .however , she or he should take such risks and show other faculty members that the ` old ways  or ` old ideas  should be given up .if this innovative approach would work ( say that other faculty members agree ) the person would be successful but there is always the risk of disapproval . ..one could avoid certain accidents if she lies on the bed all day , do not do anything at home and let the time go .but you miss a life . ..the logic is same . ..if you do not care being successful , you do not take any risks and always follow the old ways . ..but then you miss a chance . ..
