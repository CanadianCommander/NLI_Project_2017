i personally do nt agree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .l have several reasons as follows .first , the older also can enjoy their life .because , they have a lot of experience , knowledge and wisdom to whole their lives individually , ithey can have much timesecond , most older people have more free time and money than younger people .they can access everwhere and every time they like if they are fine .in japan , many elderly enjoy to travel , walk mountains , pray koto , write haiku , you know , our traditional culture and so on .for example , my grandparents love trevelling very much together .from when they finish to grow up their child , my mother .they enjoy to travel in japan , china , korea and so on .this summer , they visited new york and saw around town and enjoy to see musical in broadway .they said to me so wonderful trip !i think their freetime and many by working long time , and mental maturity can come ture that .third , now , more and more old people become to keep good health , and have long life expectancy .so they can move active as like the younger .actually .we can see that some elderly are active than some young people .i therefore , as i mentioned above , i definitely think that old people enjoy life as much as young people .
