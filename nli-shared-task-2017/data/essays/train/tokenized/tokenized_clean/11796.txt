do young people do nt give enough time to help their communities ?maybe , but do older people give enough time their community and does nt - to speak a bit epic and controverse - every community get s the people it earns ?in times were individualisation and the quest for profit are predominant , how can one expect from young people to give time in the old altruistic fashion to their community .all they learn through the medias is that it is cool to be rich , cool to be successful and that the best method of acquriing these goals is to stay focussed and not to waste their time .and if one considers this rationally one has to accept this reasoning .if the kids wo nt be good in school because they give to much to community they wo nt be able to go to halfway decent university and thus wo nt get a good job - which is still one of the most important things to get ( not only in young peoples eyes ) .and after all , do older people really give a lot time to the community .well i do nt think so .adults also try to make career and try to get the best possible outcome for themselve .so to whom could young people look upward ?so i conclude that it s not the young people who should give more of the time to their community , it s everybody .the acquired , traditional structures of communities are valauable and at some situations in life everybody will remark that he is needing them .so everybody should invest a bit more in them .but are young people really as individualistic and profit orientated as put forward above .i think there are good reasons to doubt this claim .one can observe an important backflow to traditional values within the group of young people .nowaday younger people do become involved in social activities - or how could one explain the rise in numbers of ngos .and what about the large number of young people volunteering in social projects in underdevelopped countries ?if young people are thus not giving enough time to their communities maybe these communities should think of changing their offers in order to attract young people .young people are surely willing to give their time to the community .to conclude i think one has to state that one should not blame the young people rather the communities for not adjusting to the young .
