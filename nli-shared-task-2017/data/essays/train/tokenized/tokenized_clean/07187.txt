first of all i m not totaly disagree with this statement .i think that the number of cars in use in the next twenty years will be the same that there are today .i hope that the number of cars decrease , but i m not sure that it happen .in italy , the country where i live , the situation is very difficult .everyday in the street there are a lot of cars , so there are also a lot of pollution and also a lot of incidents .today the cost of life is very high , so for many people is difficult to buy a car and they use the public transport like bus , taxi , train or underground ( metro ) .in italy , in my opinion , the public transport is not very development and i think that instead is important to increase this type of service .for example there are a lot of people , that live far away the place where they work , that everyday go to work by car , in spite of there are orher possibility to go like train as i have just said before .but in italy i know because the people prefer to use car instead of train or other public transport , because they are always in late and they are not efficent .i hope that in the next years the thing could be better than now .
