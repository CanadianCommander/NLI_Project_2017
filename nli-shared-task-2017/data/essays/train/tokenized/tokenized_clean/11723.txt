there are so many successful people in my country .they won the risk of situation .in my opinion , successful people try new things and they might be success .they always reserch new things and made a lot of money .the korea has some international company .samsung , lg , hyundai , kia , fila . .etc .they tried new things and took risks .for example .samsung had to choose future industry between memory chips and air plane industry .and finally when they choose the memory industry , almost people worried about that .because the samsung did not have any other know-how and information .but now samsung is very famous for memory .and electronic hardwares .but the successful people can not always win the risk .sometimes they got in troble financial problem .even their company can not stand anywhere .for example , the samsung owner lee , kwun-hee like cars so much .he is famous for car mania .so , he decided to make a samsung car company .before he made a his company , there were three big car campanys in korea .kia , hyundai , and daewoo .so he could not win this game .but he made a car company .the company lose the their game .and the effect was suffer from the samsung s owner .i know some example like this situation .the successful people or nomal people can try new things and wln their risks .but no always
