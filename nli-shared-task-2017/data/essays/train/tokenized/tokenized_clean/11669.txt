i agree with this statement .the reason why i think succesful people are those who try new and take chances has to do with this behaviour being the more suitable for adaptation .before i adress how these actions may serve adaptive purposes , we need to accept that life in modern society , in old society and even in most biological systems ( to cut to the chase ) is one of constant change .in light of the constant changes in everday problems and necesities , the lack of hability to try new things - or to be inovative - will invariably leave us lagged behind , uncapable to cope with even the most basic challenges .for instance , imagine an alarm company that decides not to change their sales stategies because the long time way of `` doing it well  was knocking door by door to offer their services directly into the costumers face .in the era of internet shopping for just about everything , this strategie would have foretold the collapse of the alarm selling times of this company .to point out on the need to take risks , this company , in the begining of the 70 s or 80 s would have had to start taking chances training their workers in the use of computers and comunications technology .it may have seemed incredible back then , that in 20 years a substancial amout of people would be purchasing just about everthing sitting in front of a screen in the comfort of their oun homes .but , what might haved seemed like takeing a huge risk , had to be done .therfore , i belive that being inovative and brave ( taking chances ) with work , family and friends is the key stone of succesful life .a life that may not only cope with new challenges , but may actually improve the conditions of those around us , and the condition inside ourself .
