advertissment is on of the most important ways for the companies to improve their benifets , and to sell more and more products .regardeless if it s tv advertisment or radio , or internet , it must be intresting and remarkable for the audience in order to do his job .unfortunately some companies goes too far and make their products appear much better than they really are , which makes the consumer upset after he buy the product .i still remeber many toys and devices i bought when i was young , actually i forced my parents to buy , because it was really amazing on the screen , but i was really shocked , bacause it was diffrent from what i ve seen in the advertisement .why do they do that ?i think because of the strong competition with the other companies , they have no choice .they must make their product look perfect as much as they can , otherwise , no one will buy it , specially with the kids stuff .the child does nt have the ability to analyse the advertisment and figure out if it s real or not , unlike the mature .i think the caompanies found their selves in this situation , and they hardly can change it , because of simple reason .the customer does nt help them to change it !imagine your self watching a reasnoble advertisment , showing the advantages and the disadvantages of the product , will you be intrested in it ?or will you think this way : if they could nt hide the disadvantages in the advertisement they made by themselves , how can i trust their product ?advertisment now is a very big business .huge companies work in this field , it s not easy to change this industry in order to have simple , honest , reasnoble advertisement , unless we work really hard .
