it is said that the society has turned so busy and competing , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .this observation is not fully incorrect , but it is a rather shallow approach .one must see what young people actually plan to do and the way they do it to understand the phenomenon .since the competition in the society has increased sharply , young people these days have much more to do when they are not working than the young ones even as close as some decades ago , so they usually study and prepare to get jobs .this is why it seems that young people do not give enough time to halping the society .however , that is not all they do .there are many voluntary acts that university students organize or participate on their own .for example , korean university and college students participate in education services organized by religious parties .moreover , these days they tend to organize the service by themselves .the way of committing to the community also has changed .young people from an older generation might have been involved in more general issues , such as politics , or national social movements .young people nowadays , on the other hand , tend to specify on their specialties and focus on what they can do best , or at least on what they like .as seen above , students tend to teach the children who have hard time at school but can not afford any other education .this trend goes into more specific areas .students will involve with communities close to their majors , and young workers will help those who are closer to personal interests or hobbies .for example , students who major on agriculture will go on the fields and help farmers .this will enhance their knowledge on their major as well as help the community that involves them .young workers interested in sports forming teams or coaching children for free will also be an example .as a whole , young people these days surely do not seem to give enough time to helping the community , but they sure do so in their own ways .it is only the outside that has changed due to the increased complexity and competition of the society , not the inside of the young peoples minds and souls .their ways might have changed , but they still do like any other generation might .
