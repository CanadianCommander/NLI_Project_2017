cars are the main contemporary transport devices that are widely used by people today .however , although there are a vast number of cars in our world , i think that they will start to decrease in a few decades .i believe that in twenty years , by the decrease in the amount of petroleum , and by technological improvements that will enable us to travel longer distances in cheaper costs , the number of cars will decrease dramatically .petroleum is the main natural resource that is used as the fuel for cars .however , because of the huge consumption of this natural resource , it was greatly reduced .after twenty years , the petroleum that is left will not fulfill the needs of overpopulated people in cities .because of that , petroleum prices will be much higher , and the people will have to think twice before purchasing a car .for example , because the gas prices are more than people can afford in turkey , people prefer travelling short distances by foot , and large distances by busses , which are considerably cheaper than using owned cars .because of that , the number of cars decreased considerably .therefore , because petroleum is a natural resource that is decreasing constantly , in twenty years , people will use other ways to travel , instead of cars .moreover , thanks to the technological improvements , new transportation devices , which are more convinient , are used .years after years , devices that enable quicker mass transportation have been made .for example , the usage of the underground travel system , namely metro , has increased in all around england .because of the traffic caused by the high population of cars , metros superceded cars in england .in twenty years , this new method of travelling will be widespread in the entire world , and , as a result , there will be fewer cars used for travelling .consequently , i believe that , in twenty years , by the increasing technological advances in transportation , cars will not be used anymore , as they are used today .because of unique inventions and the depletion of the natural resource of petroleum , healthier and more convinient devices will be invented for the benefit of human beings .
