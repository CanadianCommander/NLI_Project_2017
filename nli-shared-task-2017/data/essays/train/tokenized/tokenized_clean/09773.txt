young peoples are majorly useful to build a nation .they play a vital role in economic development .they have to build communities to help the nation .unfotunately , they are not showing interest to participate in a community .they dont have time to help their own communities .community means that discussing their views in one place .this could be developed through the internet or by the clubs .here they will communicate with their colleagues and freinds .when there is more discussion there will be more development .the discussion should be healthy .in communities people exchanges their views .they wil gain more knowledge with in a time .but unfortunately they are spending their time to help their communities .this is loss to a nation .for example , a computer engineer have time to help their community but they are wasting their time in consumig liquor , parties , and sleeping .this situation ocurs because of working overtime .they have lots of work to do , lots of competition and new tasks to be done .they can spare half an hour to help their communities .they are not caring it .every one has become selfish .another example is in the case of a doctor .doctors are gained mainly through their communities .even they have more to work but they should spend some time in helping their community .they have become busy in their work .they are taking more rest .if this is the case nation have to face severe problems .young poeple should be made help their communities .it is the respnsibility of the government to encourage them .they can encourage through news papers , advertisements and movies .they should be told the advantages in helping their community .ofcourse they are inspired quickly and positively .in coclusion , young people have to spend time to help their communities .if this is not the case they will loose communication which may effects the nations economy growth .they have to realise in the importance of helping their community .
