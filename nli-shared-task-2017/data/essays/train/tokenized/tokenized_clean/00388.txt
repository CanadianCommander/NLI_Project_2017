i agree .i think resently young people contact with thier communituies .for example they do nt greet with people .there is nt comunication .and they think contact of communities is boreing .but , comunication with communities is very important .becouse , this defend communities s sefty .resently , more and more commits incresing .expecially , comunication is effectiv for robber .if communities s contact hard , robber can nt aim at this city .in this way , comunities s contact make sefty .next , if young peppe contribute their communities , this city improve .young people have great power to change commuities .for example , using this power effectivilly , clean up this city .confatabule city enable to assemble people , so this city improve .and if people increse , commance deveroping .shops and departments increse too .young people give time to helping their communitise
