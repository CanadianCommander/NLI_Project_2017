in every part of our life to have more knowlage about life is important for all of us .especially if this knowlage is about acedemic subjects it will be more interesting for students who trying to maintained themselves .for some people it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject which i do not agree .i think it is better for someone or a student to have full of right knowledge about one suject .first of all its known that if someone have not right information about one subject how can he or she will know about other subjects .for example , if a person in a family dinner wants to talk about politics and starts to talk but he can not finish his sentences or can not answer the questions that his family members becouse the information that he have in his mind can not let him to express himself well .on the other hand if he had known well about politics and tell and answered th equestions about this subject it will be more affective for himself , i think it is not so much important for him to not know about international relationships which can be talked in the table .he can say he did not know about this subject and wants to know about it now which will be better answer for that conversation .secondly , in today s world to have full of academic knowledge about one subject is very important .all the parents want their children have an one job which they can take care themselves .this will be possible only if that person educate in a university .in these years no one gives a job to someone who do not finish university .for example , when someone apply for a job no one asks for that person what kind of things do you know about different subject .they just want to no if you your aducated in university and capabile for that job .to sum up , i think to know about one specific academic subject s more important than any think .everyone have to consantrate on their only subject to be more successfull then anyone .
