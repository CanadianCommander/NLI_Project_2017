i agree with the following statement .i feel so because names like mother teresa , nelson mandela who devoted there whole life towards upliftment of the human fraternity , have now become only the characters in the history text books .one could find young names engrossed in any kind of eugenic activity in only lilliputian amount .the passion , the zeal towards one s country , ones community or fraternity has effaced in the annals of history .one of the paramount reason behind this is that world today has become much more relaxed than it was before .i particularly feel that `` need  is the root of all deeds .young generation does not see any `` need  to practise such activities as the `` mileu  around them is much more out of sufferrings as it was a few decades ago .another reason is the lack of appropriate moral teachings being given to them .attitude does not change overnight , right from childhood one has to inculcate these feelings in one s persona .moral teachings are much more pedantic or limited to bookish knowledge , and hence they are not able to feel the suffering around the world .they are not taken to rendevouz with the real world , like the world prevailing in the parts of africa .therefore youngsters remain in there own blues and hence are not aware of the present scenario .to conclude , i think that media has a lot of role to play in arousing the blood in these people to flutter .media can be in any form , may it be television , newspaper or sophisticated internet tools .thinking of our young generation is largely influenced by the monster caled media , they think what media thinks .hence if media plays a vital role in changing the thinking of young people from , rather than being indifferent to their community to feel concern towards their community then it could have an comprehensive effect on the current scenario .
