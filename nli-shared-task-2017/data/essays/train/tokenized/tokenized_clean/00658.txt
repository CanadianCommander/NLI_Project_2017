there are many young and old people who are enjoying their lives in different ways .however , there are people who believe that the only time to enjoy the life is with early years .i disagree with this statement because i think that older people can enjoy there lives more than young people .for example , i met and got to know some older people here in canada after coming from my home country .i found out that these older people have older bodies but their mains are still fresh .they want to do many things that they were not able to do when they were younger .as an illustration , reg is 75 years old and he goes to the florida every year to watch some sport that he enjoys .besides , he drives his car from sarnia ontario where his has his house to the florida , it is a long trip still for young people but he is able .by the same token , some older people have enough money to pay to enjoy their lives .these people have worked hard all their life so after doing this for many years , they think about start doing something different life spend time traveling aroun the world .in addition , these people want to spend more time with their families instead of spending time working .another fact about this topic is that older people can teach young people like me to enjoy the life .i try to spend time with older people because they tell me about their experience trought their lives , for example i meet once a week with an older man who has a grat sent of humor .i try to learn from him many thing that i can use in my life .in conclusion , young people should try to follow the way how some older people spent their time many years ago .these older people always have something to share or give in order for younger people to learn how to spend the time in a correct direction .besides , these older people do nt want young people to waste their time in activities that can spoil their lifei
