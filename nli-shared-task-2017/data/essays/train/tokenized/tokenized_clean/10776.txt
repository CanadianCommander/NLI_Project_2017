it is true that nowdays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think that this is an effect of a lot changings of the world .in fact in the past young people helped their family in some works , such as to clean their room , to do their bed and so on .in this way a young boy could develop your sense of responsability and so he also learned to helping their communities .perhaps this is impossible today , because young people have many things to do and they are involved in many activities .if we think that today young people spend the major part of their time at school or that they spend their time playing videogames or watching tv , it is simple to understand this changing .i think that for young people is not important playing or studying only .they should learn to love the nature and should spend more time out .in this way they could help their community cleaning the woods or organizing some events to involve the children or old peolpe of their communities for example .to do this , it is important that the governments give the structures to create and to develop this type of society .for me this aspect of society is very important because if we want a society in that all people can be to help for another people , it is important to develop this sense of responsability in all young people .in fact for me it is not nice a society in that everyone thinks only himself .
