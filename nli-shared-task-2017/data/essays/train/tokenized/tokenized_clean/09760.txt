i dis-agree to the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guidei believe that when one travels , one needs to explore the place to the fullest .travelling is a passion which teaches you to explore , learn and experience .although i agree to the fact that tour guide have a first hand experience about the places and they have been time and again experiencing the place , i believe they are doing their job .but the actual thrill which i believe about travelling is the experience of finding it urself .when with a tour guide , one does not necessarly make an effort to find about the details of a place or the zest of it .one just goes by the tour guide and assumes that he has covered everything .tour guide is like a book , i agree , who opens out the entire picture to the travellers whom he is guiding , but the benifits of a research which one gets by meeting the local people , their food , culture and place and the rest through books or guides is phenominal .the tours led by guides ristricts the intensities of exploring a place .one has to go with the pace of the rest of the group led by the guide .this prohibits not only the learning or exploring pace but also the freedom of other decisions you want to take during the travelling experience .i as a person love to meet people , learn culture and customs of others by being around them and by interacting with them .for that reason , i totally would like to be on my own or in a comfortable group who has similar thinking and love travelling .i believe that when one is spoon fed , one does not make an effort to learn beyond the paradigm .similarly when one intends to explore a place and its people , a group led by a tour guide does not do justice to the place .the hidden facts that the tour guide conveys can also be inferred from a book or a tour guide .travelling is a form of freedom in my eyes , and i believe the best result and the knowlege of a place is when one makes an adventourous effort to explore it .
