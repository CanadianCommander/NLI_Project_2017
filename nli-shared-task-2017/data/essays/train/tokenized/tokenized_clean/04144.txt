advertisements alwasys trying to make you `` when i said you it is mean people  looke at the product from another side the best side .this is there responsibilty and it is there job to market their products .they are spending fourtune on televission , radio and posters .in my openion i thought before that they are steeling from us by convencing our children in a product i am not interested in .but by the time i have read and understand that this is bussiness and this is how it worked .it has some advantages and dis advatages .although it brought to us the very new technology , and , it help us by using all of the facilities , but in my openion i think it is wasting for our money and sometimes it is not like what we see in the televession .now aday if you opened the televission you will spend muct time watching those products .even so if you go to the movie theator you will waste so much time watching those products and you were paying to watch it .in conclussion if i had acompany i would do the same thing because people allways do not have the time to think or to try those things , they would say if it doesnt work well it would not matter because it was cheap or if i am going to returne it i would waste time .if all of families were well knoledgable those thing will not appeare .
