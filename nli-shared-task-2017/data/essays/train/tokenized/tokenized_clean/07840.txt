i disagree with this statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  nowadays many of social and political problems are appearing in front of us .many people are talking about their idea and what is the conceps of this problem .but actually there is nothing resolution because they did not think about facts .we should know the truth of the problem and everythings .many problems are happened in real life .but they are apt to be in side of their own ideas and concepts .usually people do not want to know what is the fact .this iss the reason why people can not exit from the problems .this is the reason why student should learn facts .if people do not know about facts they can entered misconception easily .in my country their are many of education systems but usually those systems are only looking for ideas and concepts .when i was young i went to elementary school in mu home country i lessoned moral class and science and many other subjects .they taugth only their ideas and what is the best way and concepts of that topic .but when i came out from the school i thought it was not true .in the real life we can not find teacher s idea and concept easily .we can see the facts and the truth .some studants can get in trouble easily by these reasons they do not about thess behave they know only thing which teacher said to them .this is my another reason why i prefer students to learn the facts and truth .people have their own idea .it would be really much idea .also these ideas are used to purchase only right way .it is not only hard to get that much ideas and but also we can use these ideas in the real life .we should keep adjusting to our neighbors and other people .from these reasons i think to learn facts are more important to students than ideas and concepts .it would make much easier to them in the future
