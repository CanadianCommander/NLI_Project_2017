in this essay i will shed light on the statment , that it is more imoportant for students to unterstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is important , that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding , but mainly this dates and names can be researched in a book , or on the internet at almost any time .although , some very important key facts must be memorized .when i was in a conversation with an american visitor in genova , standing in front of the columbus museum , i could not remember , when america was discovered .a such an important date is known by any second grade child , however i could not remember the year .he reminded me , that america was discovered in 1492 .i felt very bad at that time that i never forget this important fact in my life .however , i am convinced , that ideas and concepts are much more imporant than learn facts .concepts are more likely to be necessary in the daily life , than are facts .what i mean is , if there were two or more contries combating each other , it would be war .from school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times , that in all wars many people were killed , and in most of those land and people changed nationality once the war was over .during the war many people were killed and tortured .from the concept of war we know , that it is a very bad situation for all involved and that there are many loosers and few winners .this concept is known by everybody .in an nutshell it is important to know impotant facts , such as the discovery of the american continent , but it is far more important to understand ideas and concepts , in order to draw conclusions of a possible outcome .
