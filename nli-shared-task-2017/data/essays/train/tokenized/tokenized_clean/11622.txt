i think that successful people are often people trying a new thing .because i think successful people are people who are in action , who are doing a lot of things .and so more you are doing , so more you can change .on the other hand , successfull people are most intelligent , so that they are able to have good ideas and so they try new things .so i still agree with the appointment that successful people try new things but i think that successful people do nt try everything .they compares the risk of the new thing with the chance of it and then they decide if they want to do it .i m not sure , if successful people take more risks than other people .of course , some do .but there are people that have take more risks than other and they are very unsuccessful , like hannibal with his elephants .a man who try a new thing was henry ford , he started up a business and paid his employees 5 dollars a day , that was a realy high sold .but it works .he was very successfull .other very successfull men trying something new and take risks are bill gates or gandhi .i think if you want to be successfull you have to try new things and to take risks as well .but risk is nt risk .to buy stocks at the stock exchange and have nt money on the bank is not the same risk as if i have it .it s important to make it clear what s risk and what is really stupid .i m not the person who agree or disagree with such a statement , because it s too unspecific and too common .
