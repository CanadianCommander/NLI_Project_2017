human being is becoming successful in every aspect or every area which he is entering .people who knows what to do in near future are the only ones that will attain success in their life .when we take an example of the millionares or the billionaires they attained success only from sheer hard work in which area they are strong .so i disagree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .they will not take risks because sometimes the success may depend upon luck and the knowledge of the area in which one was entering and the losses which he had to bare and so on .human being must know the right area in which he can succeed .because he will know the easy way to get profit in business or rise to a higher position in a company .if there is a risk in that area he will surely know it and try to minimise the risk .but when a person enters a new area he will not know the risks it has .luck is the only thing that is going to help him in that new area .he will attract to the advantages rather than disadvantages .this may lead to many psycological problems which a human sometimes can not bear .enjoying life happier is just the thing that a human wants which canbe obtained only by money .some people think that they can do any thing in any where such that pouring of money is more if they enter every area .if there is a loss he would try to take his life also .so people must avoid doing such things and success will follow only when you choose the right path .more knowledge will give more success in that area so that one can rise to a higher level .so i strongly disagree with the given statement .
