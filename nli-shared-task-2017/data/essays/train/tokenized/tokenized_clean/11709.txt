i am 24 years old and i have been studying electronic engineering for five years .during my studies i have often asked to myse lf it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .from my experience i realized that the best way to attain good results is to specialize in one specific subject .in particoular thare was an event that convinced me of that .in fact there was a semster in wich i had four courses at the same time plus the development of my bachelor  s degree thesis .i was going to begin my master s studies and in the same period i even had to present my bachelor s degree thesis work in a conference .i was very busy with my thesis however i decided to register for four classes .it was a big mistake .in fact i could not attend all the lessons and when i had the exames i did not took good grades .moreover i did not have a broad knowledge but just a superficial one .this was an important experience for my future choiches .in fact i realized that a broad knowledge is something that comes with time .in the next semesters i chose to register for two or maximum three classes .i could attend all the lessons and when i studied at home i had enough time to go depper in the topic that i have had listened in class .in this way i took very good grades that now permit me to apply as ph.d. at the m.i.t . .from my experience during my master s studies i realized that it is quite difficult to have a broad and deep knowledge at the same time .therefore i think that it is better to specialize in one or few subjects .in this way it is possible to have a deeper knowledge and after few time even a broad knowledge .with this porpouse in my mind i am going to apply for my ph.d. and i am sure that in this way i will able to have other success .
