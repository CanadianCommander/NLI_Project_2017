i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i think most of the advertisements are to trick people .first of all , advertisements are made to appeal their products to people .when the companies make advertisements , it must appeal what is so good about their products and attract people to buy it .so they emphasize , sometimes exagerate , good parts of the products so that people will know what is cool about the products .of course , they do nt highlight any bad parts of the products .as a result , when customers buy the products and find out that there are some bad parts , which were never mentioned in the advertisements .when this happens people find that advertisements made products seemed much better than they really are .for example , let s say that there are two advertisements about two erasers .one says `` this is the best eraser ever invented .and the other one says `` this eraser is better than normal erasers .i think most of the people will buy the eraser that was advertised as the best eraser .probably there is not much difference in those two .but it is better than buying `` little above average  eraser .but in this case , apparently the advertisement made the eraser seem much better than they really are .i bought a mechanical pen , that was advertised that they wo nt get my hands tired .but when i used the pen , i did nt feel any difference from using the other pens .it made my hands tired .i did nt have a high-expectation for the products , so i was fine about it .but this was a good example of products being not what they were supposed to be according to the advertisement .even though that advertisements do nt give very accurate idea of the products , people know that most advertisements exagerate their products as a common sense .so i do nt think there is a major problem to overadvertise their products .
