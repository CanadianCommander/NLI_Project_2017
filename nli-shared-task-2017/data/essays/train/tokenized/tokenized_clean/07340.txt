i certainly agree with the following statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .how can a person be successful if he does nt take risks and try finding out new things in life .if a person does nt experence it , how would they know if they are good at other things and not just at one thing .if you experince different things in life you also would experience at the same time different emotions .emotions are what a person expresses and feels .while expereincing you may find out what s right and what s wrong .a successful person , in my opinion , learns form their mistakes , how would you learn from your mistakes if you only repeat what your good at .successful people try new things inorder for them to learn from their mistakes .to live successful , you have to be successful .for exmaple my mother is a successful bussiness women , she became successful after going through many different stiutations .some situations she faced were harsh and others were pleasing .you find out your successfulness after experincing different issues and going through different emotions .you never know when your successful until the end .taking risk , is all about being successful .risking your life and taking risks are one factor that helps build up your personality .it makes your personality stronger and tougher .personality is what makes you unique and different from others .if your a successful person , your personality supposed to be great and optimistic , looking at things in a postive side of view , even if you face a difficult siutation that you thought your not going to face .poeple build up thier personality by experincing different emotion .
