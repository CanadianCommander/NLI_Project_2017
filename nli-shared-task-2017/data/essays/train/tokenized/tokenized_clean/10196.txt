in my opinion this statement is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well .any new invention start with new thoughts , new creativity , planing and hard work towards the goal .for example newton , he was a scientist he gave us a lot of new principle on science but before him no body was thinking in that direction .after his , people fallows his principles and doing further more for new creation and inventions .that is thue trying new thing is better becouse if you sucssed in any concept you will become famous very fast , with new concept you can earn more money and can lead a good succesful life .for that you must be creative for new ideas and concepts .we can take a example of macdonalds , initialy it was a simple food chain but due to do right efferts in right directions , and trying some thing new , made them a gaint food chain .so in my opinion succcesful people trys new things , altough there are lot of hard work , passions , time and money required towards the goal .in conclusion i will say that if u want to be successfull person , you have to keep trying new things rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .
