i agree with the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .let me begin by saying that time has changed .in former times most of the people live in small villages and everybody knows each other .it was common that young people help in their communities .nowadays , for example in big cities nobody really cares about the others .they often do not even know their neighbours .so it s difficult for young people to help .secondly in former days parents were stricter than now .young people had to help in their communities , because their parents did it as well .they had no choise to do other things they might prefer .and in my opinion this is a good system , because people at this age often do nt think of helping in their communities .today parents let them decide theirselves if they want to help or not .and if it was not expeceted to them , only a few people at this age are kind enough to help .i think parents play an important role at this question .last but not least nowadays people might have nt enough time to help their communities .they have to go to school and after that they have to do their homework .today this could be a lot of work and in some areas schools lasts till late in the afternoon .after finishing this most children or teens just want to relaxe or do some sports .it might sound egoistic but they do not really care about their communities .because they are still young i think they need to play after work and they do nt want to help anybody .in conclusion i agree with the statement because times have changed and people really do nt spend much time to helpnig their communities .
