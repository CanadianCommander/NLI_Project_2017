today every fifth person in the world has a car which he calls his own , that s what the statistic tells us in the daily news .to have a car means not necessarily to have a drivers licence but a high number of car owners have one .at the moment we are in 2006 and the price for one liter of disel petroil costs about one euro and eight cent in germany .let s switch to 2026 , 20 years later , the question which will be asked is , are there fewer cars in use than there are today .what could be reasons for driving no more cars in twenty years .in 20 years the petroil prices will be raised enormous because oil gets more and more rare .and if it gets rare it gets more expensive .only less people could pay a much higher price for petroil than they do today .where do we get petroil from .new inventions like the solar car would be great to have at that time .no more petroil , only sun .i think that will be a great opportunity to drive cars in 20 years .but does it work .if the climate changes as fast as it changes at the moment you ca nt be sure that this theory works well .cars get more and more expensive .new inventions , new designs , new colours , new sizes , new models . ..how could we pay for that .in germany people have less and less money to pay for cars .cars will get more and more a luxury product and only people with an high income and with less children or no children can afford a car .the unemlpoyment rate grows more and more , in 20 years we will have a lot of unemployed people around the wold .on one hand you have poor people who never can afford a car , on the other hand you have unemployed people who will get poor after a short period of time , so it s a vicious circle , loose your job , have less money , get poor and we are at the point where you ca nt afford a car .in my opinion we will have a great barrier between those who can afford a car and drive a car and them who ca nt buy cars to drive .those who have money will be able to buy the new luxury good like a car will be at that time , but these people show a minority of the world s population .so as a result i would say that in 20 years there will be fewer cars than today because of prices of petroil , the stronger environment rules , the unemployment situation and the not available people who could buy cars .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody !
