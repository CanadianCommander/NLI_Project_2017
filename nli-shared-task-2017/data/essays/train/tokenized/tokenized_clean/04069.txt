a person that is successfull or wants to be successfull likes to try new things and take risks in life instead of doing only what they know they are good at .this might be because a truly successfull person knows that an unending process of learning is what being successfull is all about .when you try new things you learn and see things you did not know about and your perception becaomes wiser , your knowledge is expanded .when you do something only because you know you are skilled at it you are denying your your chance to explore the other possibilities and innovations the world can offer .therefore , i consider my mom to be a very successfull and lawyer and human being .she is a person that has travelled to many countries , and consequently has been to three different continents .she has seen many cultures , even experienced many cultures and has perceived the definition of justice other countries have .she has gained experience because of this and implemented it in her work , she even visited prisons to get to know cases and approach the venezuelan legal system a different .all of these experiences made her a successfull lawyer that even worked with the government and defended well known officials of the government .on the otherhand , one can be and wants to be successfull in many aspects of life , especially , in one very essential which is love .my cousin had a crush on girl for three years and acted like her best friend when in fact he loved her .he was an amazing friend and was very good in that position , he resignated to being that because he was afraid if he told her his feelings she would reject him .finally , after me and his friends convinced him , he took the risk of asking her and telling her what he truly felt .she felt the same about , so by being strong and courageous enough my cousin felt happy and very successfull .adquiring experience by trying new things sometimes usefull , sometimes even a waste of time makes you grow as a person and increases your knowledge .you more power in your life to make decisions , embrace changes and know what happiness truly is for you .to try new things you have to have courage , to be determined and to make risks .in taking risks you can lose but can also win and know instead of wondering .
