community is where the people thrive and learn the lessons of social life .serving the community is one of the ways you can pay back .we live in a global village which has no boundaries and it would be short sighted of us to just consider our own community .to start with i would like to disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are quite a number of reasons for the same .when a community faces a problem then all people associated come forward to solve the problem .young people are as much a part of the community as anyone else .and if they do nt help their community then its them who will have to suffer along .for an instance the students at iit powai , mumbai cleaned the powai lake which is a fresh water body and one of the major source of drinking water in mumbai .no one forced them to do this but they made waves when they undertook this task and many organizations came forward to help with equipment and funding .then again there are other ways in which one can help .like for an instance blood donation campaign and donation of clothes and necessary items for the needy .we at our company have regular blood donation campaigns and help age group activities .donations are never monitory but still they help .sometimes we just give our time , time for the people who crave attention like the generation of grandparents .and this also gives a sort of self satisfaction and self revelation as well .there are also people who are joining red-cross and other organizations to help the needy .the doctors in these missions are also young .i know a family personally who renounced everything for the good of the down-trodden , and they are not just any graduates but engineers working for mncs .in the end i would like to say that help can be of different kinds , if we are helping the world as a whole then we should not be self centered to just consider our own place only .so it is not correct to say that young are not helping the community when they are helping the world as a whole .
