advertisments are helpful for all companies , it helps them market their product in a fascinating way that will convince others .with all the help a one minute show advertisement is carring to a company , i agree that most advertisements make produts seem much better than they really are .people who get amused with a certain advertisment that pop out on the television every couple of minutes , in my opinion these people are sick , because they get attracted to a certain product without even knowing what does this product consists of .companies try to win our attention with a silly advertisment to convince us , and i ca nt say they dont gain our attention .most advertisments make products look much better , and the prove is that when you buy the prcoduct you get shoked with the type of quality and the exaggerated advertisment done for it .in my opinion all companies sell the same products without even caring wether the product is useful or not , befefitible or not .manegers may forget about their conciouns and work for the aim of money .in conclusion , be wise and pay attention to what is going around you , because you might reach a certain point that you might lose yourself following dreams that does not even exist .
