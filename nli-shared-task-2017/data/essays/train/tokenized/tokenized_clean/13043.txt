i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .though i think that the choice should be made depending on each person s individaul personanlity and preference , there are more disadvantages of taveling in a group than traveling alone .for one thing , i believe that some people do not like being in a group .for those people .traveling in agroup will be very uncomfortable .i have many friends who do not want to be in a group .they may need more free time to relax and meditate by themselves .second , traveling group people can not decide where to go or what to eat on their own .they should cooperate with other members and somtimes they should give up their choices for the schedule of group .i have an example from my own personal experience .i was traveling in italy in a group with a guide .the guide asked which restaurant people wanted to enter for lunch .malority of people wanted to have italian pizza while i wanted to have stake .i should have to give up stake becuase i was the only person who wanted it .if i had traveled alone , this kind of thing would never have happend .third , moving in group can not as fast and efficient as moving alone .for example , people should wait until all the members get together and it is not easy to find space for many people in restaurant or theaters .one of friends told me her terrible experienc of travel .when she traveld china in a group , one of the members was lost in the great wall and all the other people wasted time finding the person and they gave up rest of schedule .but i also admit that traveling in a group led by guide have some advantages .for example , i do not have to study how to travel or what to prepare because the guide will do it for me .i do not have to worry what if i am lost , either .but more research on the traveling country will give me more sense of achievement after finishing traveling .traveling in a group led by a tour guide involves a lot of disadvantages , less free time , less options to chose and less efficiency of movement .though it can be more convenient to be led by a guide , one should sacrifice those things for convenience .lastly , i believe that completing traveling by oneself will give him or her more sense of achievement with more exposure to the country they travel .so , i can not agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
