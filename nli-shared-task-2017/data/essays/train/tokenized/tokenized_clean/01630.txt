i agree with the statemant that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i have two reason why i agree with the statement .one reason is that there will be a lot of people in here japan in twenty years .so if there are a lot of people here in japan , of course they will buy a fewer cars and use it maybe everyday .because it is really usefull to use a fewer car when we go to somewhere eals .so i am sure that they will buy a fewer car .other reason is that there will be a lot of nice fewer cars , great fewer cars and very usefull fewer cars here in japan in twenty years .so people will want to get them !as a results , in japan in twenty years , i agree with the statemant .because there will be a lot of people and also there will be a lot of usefull fewer cars and so on .
