today , there are many kinds of persons who behave in several different ways .some take risks , some plays it safe .most people think that persons who take risks are more successful rather than others who do what they already know how to do well .it is difficult to say this statement is true or wrong .in fact , i think it is true that people try new things and take risks are more successful than others for several reasons .first of all , people who do nt take risks stay always in a same field .for example , a man who have already worked in a small restaurant have good chance to work in it for his or her entire life .on the other hand .eople who take risks could find their positive ability easily .therefore , they can work in a field that they are good to do for example .people who are not afraid to take risks could improve the probability to success , because they are always trying to do well .second , it is easier to get higher gain by taking risks .for example , an investor who invests in a mutural fund of a poor country could double or triple the amount of money faster .they take risks , but they are always challenging to make it better , therefore , they easily success in various situation .in contrast , people who do nt take any risk could get the gain safely , but slowly .we were all born to do something big to increase our well-being in this society , so why should they play it safe ?i really do nt think people who do nt take risks are more successfull than other who take risks .in summary , i agree that people take risks are more successful than others do nt take risks for those two reasons .people are afraid to take risks to get more gain , but they should be brave enough to take some risks to succeed in their lives .
