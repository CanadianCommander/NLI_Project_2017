looking at the television , newspapers , books , or even our own environment , we can easily view successful people who live a valuable and meaningful life .some may argue they merely did what they already knew how to do well .however , two successful models , tyra banks and ki-man lee , contradict the idea .first , tyra banks took a new step to be a model when she could have just gone to the college she was already accepted .when she was only seventeen years old , tyra banks decided to take a new step : being a model .she immediatley goes to paris in france and looks for opportunities .however , it was not easy as it sounds .she lived in a small apartment , cramped with twenty other models , away from her family .everyday , in oder to get a job , she will go to twenty five agencies a day , and will be on time for every single one of them .after all the hardship she went through , she finally had a contract with an agancy in paris and started to begin her career .of course , she continued to try her best at every situation , and finally became known to the public after seveal years .now , she is one of the most noted , admired , and respected models in the world .she is now viewed as a successfull model possessing intelligence and maturity .second , ki-man lee took a new step of being a model when he was once a wrester who weighted 230 pounds .as a young boy , ki-man lee always dreamed of being a model .but it was only a dream for him , since he was a professional wrester who was far from having a model body .when he was 27 years old , however , he decides to achieve his goal .at first , people derided him for even thinking about such a goal .but no one could stop him .by hard work , he lost 100 pounds and fled to paris .like tyra banks , he visited numerous agencies and was eventually accepted .he then expanded his career to be a runway model in the most noted fashion runway .now , he is a famous and successful model in france , where people admire him for his determination and ambition .in short , tyra banks and ki-man lee transfered from doing what they already know ho to do , to attempting new things .this enabled both of them to be successful and respected models .people are meant to be successful if they take risks and try new things because they have the courage and determination to take a new step .
