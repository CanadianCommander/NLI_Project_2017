i can agree with the statement .but we can not see the matter from a single point of view > there are in fact two contrasting forces governing the number of cars in the world .on one hand , we have western industrial country .their whealthy life style has to face the problem that the increasing cost of fuel creates > actually many countries use more fuel than how much they can produce .for this reason , they buy petroluem by saudi arabia or iraq , who can produce a lot of it .but its cost has widely increased in the last years due to the tensions that terrorism and the isralian situation created .moreover , as a non renewable resource , its quantity will decrease over time .for this reason , i think that in the western countries the number of the cars will decrease in the next twenty years according to the increasing of the cost of fuels .we can-t forget that in the other hand there are the newly indutrial countries , like india or china .this countries experienced in the last years a real industrial revolution that brought their whealth to increase .as a consequence , the new middle class in this countries began to use its new economical power to express its social status , like the middle class of the western world did before .in this new trend , having a car was no more a need , but a symbol .but this brought them to face a problem they never faced before , that is the air pollution created by a car .in these countries in fact , and specially in china , this problem has led to physical hillness in the last few years , and in my opinion it will increase in the next .so we could see a decrease in the number of cars in order to resolve this problem , or at least we could see the same scenario of the western world to which developing nations could be brought by the increase of oil demands .according to all these instances , i think that , for different reasons , there will be fewer cars in use than today .
