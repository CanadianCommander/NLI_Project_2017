if it is more important for students to understand the idea of a topic or to learn facts can be seen from different points of views .there are positive and negative sides in both ways .understanding the ideas and concepts of a topic often makes it easier for students to learn .they do not have to study as much .many people think that this way of understanding is more important than learning facts .of course you have to understand the idea to be able to understand the whole but topics but a topic can be too complex and contain too many details .a very important accpect is also how a teacher explains a problem .some teachers are not able to teach and students are often confused by their theories .other teachers are really good and everybody understand the concept .but if a teacher is not good you have to study on your own which often means to just learn the facts .it also depense on the topic given .if students have to study for history for example it is often enough to just learn the facts but on the other hand studing for physics or maths needs the understanding of the concepts .some subjects you can not learn , you have to understand them .another point is that people are different and that people learn different .some students understand the idea and are so able to understand or realize the other parts of a topic .other students do better by learning the facts , by reading things over and over again they eventually get the whole concept .all in all both theories are necessary to understand a problem fully .understanding the idea can help learn the facts and learning the facts can help understand the problem .in my opinion wether understanding the concepts or learning the facts depens on a topic is better is better , i could not choose because for me it always depense on the topic or the problem .sometimes i need to learn the facts and on other occations i understand the idea and it helps me to succeed .
