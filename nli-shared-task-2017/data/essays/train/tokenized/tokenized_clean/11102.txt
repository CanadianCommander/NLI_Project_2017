i agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  because people gain experience with what they had previously done and this improves their perfection and creativity of doing things betterly .they are also financially well settled and the persons reputation also helps the new project to be successfull .for example lets see about reliance industies proprieter mr.dhirubhai ambani first he started his life as a small business man and with his hard work and planing he became successfull millionare in the world .after that he and his family is financially settled and they moved into new ventures like mobile communication and networks , insurance and mediclaim policies .though they took risk in starting venturies , they were able to attain success because of their confidence , creativity .experience and ability to face the risk and solving the problems , leadership , team spirit and their motivation towards the employees present in the firm led them a great success .firstly to start a new venture there must be a proper planing which should aim for long term benefits rather than short term benefitsand with their tactics people should be able to capture the market , if it is maintained constantly interms of reliability then long term benefits can be obtained .but there are cases where the new ventures during there start only are facing many losses in the stock markets .this happened because of not proper advertising , not maintaing proper standard and quality of goods and can also be there because of improper employee-employer relationship .if these problems are solved then the new ventures also will become successfullfrom this i conclude that successfull people try new things and take risks only when they are properly planned about their new projects and in addition to that their experience .decision making ability , motivation are also making the new venture to become successfull .
