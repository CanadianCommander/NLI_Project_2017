some people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .others may have negative points of view .in my opinion , i argues that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays .there are some reasons to support my opinion .i will mention them as follows .to begin with , as technology developed , young people do not care about other things except for the computer .they spend most of their time to surfing the internet , playing computer games , and chatting on line .for example , they like to make friends on the internet and use msn messenger to `` talk  with each other , instead of useing the telephone .they are so intrigued in playing games online that they do not want to spend time getting along with their family .in addition , young people are protected well by their parents .hence , they do not need to work hard to earn lots of money .they fool around all day long without being asked to make money for living .whenever they needs money , all they have to do is to open their mouth and say `` mom , i want some money .consequently , they do not care about doing something meanful to their communties .the third reason that i think young people do not give time to helping is that the environment do not give them the opportunity .for instance , young people have a comfortable and convenient environment to live .they are carefree and happy all the time , not worrying about other things .there are no difficuties for the young people to solve .therefore , they do nt have the idea to help others and even their communities .taking into account the reasons i listed above , i consent to the statement that young poeple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
