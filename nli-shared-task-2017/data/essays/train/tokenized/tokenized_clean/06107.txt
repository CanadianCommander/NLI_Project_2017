my parents often tell me to enjoy life .i understood that they have some regrets about things they wanted to do but they did nt .that s why i am sure that older people enjoy life more than young people .i consider that young people are people from 15 to 30 years old .i think young people do nt have time to enjoy life .except the young people who do nt care about his future , the others have always to work hard in order to have a good job , a good life . ..they are constantly worried by something .older people , who know that there are things more important than money because of their experience , try to enjoy life as long as they can .that s why my parents , and more generaly most of the parents , try to have good times with their children , even when children do nt want .the fact that older people know the death , and realize how life is short , is a reason of my conviction .they try to do everything they could nt do when they were younger , and that s why we can observe more and more parents practicing activity `` reserved  to young people .i remember the day i met a group of older people in a party organized for young people .it was really amazing because they seemed to have more fun than us .i do nt say that young people never have fun .we see more young people in concert or bowling than older people .but the way to appreciate the moment is not the same .because of their experience , older people tend to appreciate more than us .younger people often do nt realize that life will not be always like a student life .they think that it will go on so they do nt appreciate .to conclude , older people enjoy life more than younger people , as far as their body allows them .
