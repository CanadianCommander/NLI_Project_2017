i agree with the statement , and feel that only a hand full of people spend enough time for helping their communities .the following are few of the resons why i agree .first of all , the young people are so much inclined towards their job and shaping their carrier and looking for leading a luxurious life , that they hardly get any time for helping their communities .they have time to go to the pubs and hanging around with their friends but hardly any of them spends time for their communities .recently , i approached a friend of mine to accompany me to an old aged community , that runs for the old people who have been abandoned by their children , only to give some food to them that my mother had prepared .but he began to give all lame excuses that he has to go out along with his parent s .later i found out that he was at home the whole day .he did not even think that by doing so how happy will they feel .also helping their communities implies that the person has some humanity feeling in him .moreover , the young people in their teens are so much so influenced by their friends and other activities that at a point they even do not behave properly with their own parent s .for them , their friends are their everything .such people hardly spend any time helping their communities .looking at this rate the young people , must realise that after some age even they will not be young and also they will be in need of young people for help .atleast , having this in mind they must spend time for helping .the above reasons makes me feel so , in order to overcome this , the young people , especially the student s must make it a routine to spend some time , not much , but atleast half an hour per day for helping the communities .
