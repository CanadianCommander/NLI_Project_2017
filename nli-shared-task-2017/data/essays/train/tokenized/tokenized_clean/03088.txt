nowadays , people are having busy time for doing their stuffs and they merely go for looking in front of them .even though some people are volunteering for the social communities .however , i think lots of people does nt care about the people who live with us .so , i agree with the statement that young generation does not have much time to help their communities .those are following reasons why i am consider like that .first of all , the technological environment has been developed and it causes people to think themselves than society .abundant of technologies are invented in modern days such as television , computer , and telephone , etc .it developed the culture in the country where we live in now , and people can have more fun with bunches of machines .therefore , we do nt have to think that having fun with comunicating with other groups .so , it makes young people to do not care about helping problems in society .also , young generations are more excited about constructing their own life .they are more satisfied with achiving their goal for making their life successful .for example , some young adults are really interested about getting job for future .however , they are not care about helping the old people or disabled people .it happened frequently in the public transportation .the young people just ignore the old people who could nt find the space for sitting down .the young generations are only think where they will arrive .finally , it causes the isolation of old generation .they been found the place to take a rest , but it is not easy .to sum up , for advancing the field of technology presessed young adults and it makes people who just persuing the goals without considerating other people .in conclusion , i proclaim that young people should start to concern about other people who lives in dark side in this world .
