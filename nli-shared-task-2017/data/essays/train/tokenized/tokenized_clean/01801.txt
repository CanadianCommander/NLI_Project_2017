todays , many students are forcing to perform a lot of role .they have to both study hard and help community .but they have enough time to perform various role .it can be explain to two reason .i will explain it in detail .first , although , they want to participate in community like activity helping orphanage or the poor , their parents does nt like it .they think that their children have to study more for surviving competition .they give a good circumstance to study for their children .and they always saids that studying is most important .for this reason , student study harder in their school and their academic institutions .let me take my friends as an example .his initial dream was a counselor for poor person .he interested in books and class such as counselling for community .but their parents disagreed his idea .they always argued because of this problem .after all , he had to give up his dream .and he made up decision teacher their parents want .secondly , the society does nt ask for these oppourtunity .students are likely to think that time to helping communitie does not neccessary .instead of this time , they asked for them more high grades in their school and some qualification such as toeic or toefl grades .for them , community exercise is not their interesing requirement .during school period , students often worried about their grades and evaluation from their teacher or professor .in order to give a good grade , they have too much efforts .however , no one worry about their community .in conclusion , from these two reason , young people do not give enought time to helping their communities .they may want to experience this time to help other people .so , for solving a problem , both household and work place help young people .
