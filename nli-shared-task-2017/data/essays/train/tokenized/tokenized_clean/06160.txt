there is an opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .as far as i m concerned , i believe that this issue should be evaluated in the certain context .having a broad range of knowledge subjects , we willl get exposure to a variety of knowledge fields , which will prepare us with some universal knowledge which are necessary for any futher reasearch .also , the access to a wide range of study subjects will help us to foster a good thinking mode to reason the any academic issue from a high-level perspective before we go any further .however , the knowledge the learner get through this way may not be much substantial at the cost of the wide range .specific subject , on the other hand , will benefit the learner , with an in-depth knowledge and skill sets , which are critical to explore in the certain field and to get substantial understanding of the major he works on .only with intensive training in the specific subject , one could be expected to make impressive achievement in this field .comparing the advantages and charecteristis of the broad knowledge and specific subject , we can tell that they help people in different ways .as a result , the focus on the different sides of these two study modes varies accordingly to the studying period the learner is in .for instance , if a person is a beginner , it is necessay to instill him with a wide range of knowledges , such as philosophsoy , geometry and maths , etc .only through the extensive learning , he can build himself a well-prepared platform for any further research .in another circumstance , if the learner is already well equipped with a broad range of knowledge and does know where his academic interest and strength lie in .the specific subject learning should kick in .since he needs , at this time of period , the solid specific subject knowledge to prospell , even accelarate his reasearch in certanin academic field , rather than staying in the phase of exposing to a broad range of knowledge as much as possible .
