in this era of rapid economical and technological developments , where people are judged and respected by the amount of property they have and the guise they pose , an increase , in the number of cars , in the recent future doesnot sound astonishing .according to my opinion , in view of the increasing standard of living , the number of cars will go up in the near future .so , i disagree with the statement , that , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use , than there are today .firstly , with the modern lifestyle and increasing standards , number of cars will increase rapidly .as the trend in the society changes , people tend to follow these .because , cars are seen everywhere today , much population will try to buy a car and be on-par with others in the society .owning a car , has become a prestige issue in most of the modern communities .to state an example , many of my neighbors , bought a car , though not absolutely necessary for them , because , other people around have one .secondly , with the assistance provided by the government , as loans , more people are trying to buy a car .when a vehicle is bought with the loan taken from the government , a person has to pay lesser tax and has certain other benefits .in order to take this advantage , people start buying more and more cars and as a result , the number of cars would go up in next twenty years .more banks have started giving vehicle loans in towns and cities .thirdly , having a car , serves many purposes .people can go out for a trip or weekend with their families in a car without any trouble .whereas , not owning a car , makes them to depend on other sources , that are not so attractive .a small family , can plan trips in a car so often at their own convenience .whereas , a two-wheeler is not so comfortable in this matter .it also helps people against heat , rains , dust and others .it is proved that , people travelling by a car are more protected against various kinds of pollution .moreover , having a car , makes life happier and more enjoyable to modern public .even adults are preferring to travel by cars and planning to have one as soon as possible .while travelling in a car , people can listen to music also .finally , considering all the above stated reasons , and keeping in view the psychological aspects of human beings , i can conclude that , there will be more number of cars in use , than there are today .
