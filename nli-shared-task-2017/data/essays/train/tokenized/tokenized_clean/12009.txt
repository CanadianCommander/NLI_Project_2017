i agree with the statement that most advertisings make products seem much better than they really are .it is obvious that the world of advertising is not the real world .one may ask , why this business is still running so well , although everybody seems to know that all these advertisings are fiction .in my opinion it is not worth discussing this particular circumstance stated in the statement .much more interesting is the fact that the advertising industry is such a lively and successful industry .to question that , will lighten up the reasons , why the untruth of advertising finally does nt bother us .everybody knows , that there is a lie lying in advertisings in general .but i think , there is something like an agreenment going on in modern societies , an agreement between people and the advertising companies .advertising satifies longings of masses of people and it became a space or a tool to express , exchange , consume and play with ways of lifestyle .and this is the keyword for explaining this whole situation .in my opinion people enjoy to get informed in this way .this can be seen from different views .on the one hand it s a way of freedom , based on his or her own responsibility , on the other hand its a subtile way of leathership that te advertising companies were able to grasp .so there is a world that consists out of longings and desires and there is no point to discuss the fitting between the advertinsing and th eproduct itself .this industry cares about lifestyle and that it .
