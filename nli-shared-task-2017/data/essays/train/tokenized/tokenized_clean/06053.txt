the world has changed drastically since the invention of cars .they have made life a lot easier than it used to be .and even though their usage has raised certain environmental concerns , it is my belief that the number of cars used by people will actually increase over the next twenty years .first of all , it is an established fact that the world population is increasing .more and more people are populating the earth , and many of those people will need to buy a car at a certain point in their life .for example , parents who have just had a new baby might in twenty years , or even sooner , make the decision to buy their son or daughter a car if they can afford it .in addition to that , the prices of cars are no longer as high as they used to be ; one can find cars that fit almost anyone s budget .payment facilitations also play an important role , so that you can buy a car now and pay for it in monthly installments at competitive interest rates .and let us not ignore the fact that there are people in the world that have a lot of money to spare and like to follow the latest trends .so they tend to buy the latest mercedes or bmw models , or even both !to sum up , there are many factors that might lead to an increase in the number of cars available for use by people .whether they are social factors having to do with the increasing number of people inhabiting this earth , or financial factors that have made it easier for midlle class citizens to buy their own cars .but the question remains , what effect will that have on our environment ?that should be our main concern .
