the first questions that comes to my mind after reading that statement is `` did people in the past spend more time helping their communities ?.to answer that question we should take a short look at the society in earlier times .a hundred years ago the communties where much smaller than these days .300 years ago there was no supermarket in small villages .people had to work together to survive .the farmer had to grow food , the tailor had to produce clothes .everyone was interested in getting the best out of what they were doing .therefore they often contributed something to help their community .that has changed .today a lot of people do nt really care about their neighbors and/or surroundings .for example we have a big house with 6 floors .20 families are living in this house .the house is very dirty inside , when you step outside you can find dog s excrements everywhere .neighbors call the police all the time , because they think their neighbor is too noisy .here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together .they are not helping eachother and instead try to make life harder for everyone around .the country germany is another example for a community .we have many different provinces in this country and they usually do nt work together that much .every province tries to get the best result for themselves , but instead of doing that through helping other provinces and contributing something to the community they just try to get the most amount of money they can .so why is it that people nowadays do not spend a lot of time to help their communities ?we all know that people have the time .people watch many hours t.v. everyday due to boredom .they could use that time to help the community .the problem is that a lot of people do nt feel responsible for their community anymore .they see that the house is dirty , but they are not willing to do anything about it .either because they think `` i m not going to do it , someone else can do it.  or they think `` if nobody is cleaning it , why should i ?.a way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone .
