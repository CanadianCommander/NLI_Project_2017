i agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , but with some limitations .i think that for young people is very important to understand concepts in a deep way because after the graduate they should use what they have learned .so is good that university force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams .but many of the people that attend university are not young , and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interactive and with facts .infact they need to match what they are studing with what they have learned from their experience .for a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience .i attend the second year of undergraduate course in bocconi , a university of economy in milan .during the course often happend that the lesson is boring .the lessons usually take about 2 hours each and it s difficult to keep the concentration during all the time .it will be better if sometimes the lessons contain facts because that help to hold the concentration and sometimes help to understand concepts .with this type of lesson students can both learn concepts and facts , start to understand how the things they are studing are related to the work .in my opinion good universities should prepare you with lots of concepts but also with some real example to apply what you have learned .moreover you can chage your idea during the life but before you have to understand that idea .ideas and concepts are better than facts for students but a preparation only with concepts will not make you able to join the world of work .
