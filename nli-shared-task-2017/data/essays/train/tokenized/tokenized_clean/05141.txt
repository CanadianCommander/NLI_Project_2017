` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  ...i would certainly agree with the statement .travelling is a lot of fun and also a good learning experience .if one wants to enjoy as well as learn the abouth the history , culture and habitat of the place a tour guide would certainly be helpful .educating oneself about the place prior to visiting it by books and the internet is very helpful too but having a guide who is local and has the knowledge is definately better .i feel that in a group with a guide one can have a planned itineary and can organize the trip in a better fashion .if i would be by myself i probably would get lazy most mornings and waste time getting around .by being in a group i would probably use my time and money in a more efficient way .for me even while im travelling going by a schedule really helps .being by oneself i feel one wastes lot of time first collecting the information and then deciding where and when to go .with a tour guide one is in better hands to travel and sight see comparing to ones own .by having a tour guide one can learn more .i feel that i remember more after seeing a thing / place and listening about it rather than just reading about it .a local guide might have some stories to tell about the place which one may not find in any of the books .personally for me a group of people is more fun to go out with .i strongly agree with the statement - ` more the merrier  .travelling , singing , dancing and eating out could be more fun for me with more people around rather than being by myself .going to a new place might be intimidating at first but being in a group would just make me feel at home all the time .i love making new friends and going out in a group also helps cultivating new relationships and friends .hence i would strongly recommend anyone to travel in a group rather than being on ones own .
