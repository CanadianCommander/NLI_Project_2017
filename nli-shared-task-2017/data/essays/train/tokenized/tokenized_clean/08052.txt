today almost evey adult has a car .most people use their car eveyday , for essential things such as going to work or driving to a supermarket to buy food .a car is an element of daily life .of course in cities where there is a good public transport system , people do not need a car for their daily life .but in more rural areas or cities where puplic transport is not very effective , there is the need of cars .reasons to reduce the number of cars are to protect the environment and the fact that cars and fuel are getting more and more expensive .maybe in some years there are no more as many people as today who can afford a car .on the other hand there is the fact that business and working life gets more and more flexible , spontaneous and individal , and the need to get to a specific place in a short time increases .and we should not forget the industrial branches that produce cars .weighing these points , i came to the conclusion that i do not think the number of cars will decrease .i want to point out that i think it would be a better development for life on earth if there would be fewer cars in twenty years , but i do not think this will happen .today industry that produces cars is still a growing business , and i can not imagine that this would change in the next few decades .i study geodesy , and something that i could do later is developing navigation systems .an example where navigation system are commonly used is in cars .many people and companies work and research for new developments in cars and components for cars .so i do not see a financial reason why fewer cars should be produced in twenty years .to sum up i want to say that i would be very happy if there were fewer cars in twenty years .the reason for this opinion is the protection of nature and the environment and to reduce pollution caused by cars .but i do not think this will happen because business and earning money encourage the production of more and more cars .and i can not imagine that business interests will step behind in favour of environmental reasons .
