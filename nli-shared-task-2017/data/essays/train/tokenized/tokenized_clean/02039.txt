since the begining of respectable civilisations people taught their children and students to understand concepts and theory .but when you ask a wise student what he thinks is better the theoretical or practical aspects of things , he will respond  of course practical  .let s take for example a history book , the chapter of  alexander the great  is filled wih historical facts , things that did happen , not ideas that has no shape in a students mind .people are attracted by the practical things since theory is too vapid for them .theory needs a lot of concentration without really matching the concept .a person will be able to match and understand something once he tasted the thing .as a student i did not understand the chapter of  probability  by the first time i needed a lot of revisions and practice and especilly practical practice .i did use a coin for example to understand the difference between two probabilities .how can a student understand maths and history without being confronted to pragmatic situations .in order to convey this kind of information a teacher has to make us feel the concept of the experiment .can we say that alexander the great had two daughters ?of course not , because the thing is that alexander did not have any children .this is a fact and can not be argued , because history and ethnology are facts and not nebulous ideas without shpe .let s talk about arts and music , how can we say  this is the fact  these hobbies can not be considered as undeniable because there is no answer for a question of art such as  is it beautiful ?  i could say yes and my brother no .but if someone asks me  did julius cesar have a son ?  i wuld say just as my brother  yes  because in fact this response is undeniable .in conclusion concepts differ from facts and students have to manage both of them in order to be succesful in the viewing of situations in life .as i stated earlier their are no different answers for a fact but their are infinite ones for an idea that one may not sahre or take as granted .the real use or  fusion  of an idea and a fact will appear once someone tries to be a philosopher and then try to resolve unresolvable problems that our ancestors thaught of before us
