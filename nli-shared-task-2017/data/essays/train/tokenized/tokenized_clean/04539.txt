we are now in a youth communities , all the benifits are given to the young people first then the sinior citizen .i agree that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays , the young generation do nt really involved in all this politics , social issues that occured in their country or state .firstly , i would like to say that our young people are not encouraged by their friends , family , or societies .besides that , the education are not really emphazing it as a very important issues to help the communities .young people are all verin this new era , young people will be occupied by all the new entertainment .our country are getting high tech , everything is so convenience .for example , online shopping , we are able to purchase anything we want just with a click .with this , the interaction between people and people is getting less and less .this is a very competitive world , everyone wants to get the bests for themselves .they want the best job , best car , best house , and etc .so , everyone is trying their best to get what they want , they wo nt think of others , but only think of how to bettle with others to prove that they are the best .my conclusion is that young people nowadys are very self centred , they only care for themselves but not for other people around them .
