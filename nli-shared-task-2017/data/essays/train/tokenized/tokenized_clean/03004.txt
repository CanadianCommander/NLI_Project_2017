on the one hand , risk is something unknown so you can never bet if it ll turn well or not , but on the other hand , i m sure if you do nt take any risk you ll never be successful .although some people think that success is not about risk but just a result of their personal ability , i agree with the statement because different experiences convinced me to that .first of all , i think about history and all the mathematicians , philosophers , writers ( let s think about galileo , giordano bruno , newton and so on ) who often challenged the way of thinking of their age and because of that they almost died poor and alone .but what re we still studying in high school or even in a ph .d ?eventually they were able to carry their ideas through centuries and we would nt ever have their thoughts and teachings if they did nt risk during their life .they contributed to create our way of thinking so they re really are among the most successful people ever existed .another experience convinces me that risk is an inner quality in successful people .i m talking about all the stories we read on the internet or books about poor people who decide to change their lifes drastically , maybe starting a new business , or `` playing  at the stock exchange market , and suddendly create an empire ( did nt bill gates start in a garage , did he ? )if there were no risk , nothing would ever been created .now thousands of people work thanks to the risk taken by someone in the past , is nt that successful ?from my point of view , nowadays many people could get wrong on the concept of successful , it s not just about business and creating money and that s why i consider successful all the international organization s members ( and every peace  maker there ) who everyday challenge incredibly dangerous situations risking their lives in war countries or simply helping children with mortal diseases in africa .that s what really makes a better world .in conclusion i think that everyone should take his or her own risks , maybe in what they do the best , in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to take
