i surely agree ! ..i am not happy to know this thing , but it is the truth .advertising is made to convince people that a product is better then all the others .nowdays the answer is fewer than purpose , so companies needs to advertise their products to sell them .in this cetury , or better in the last fifty years the diffusion of mass media all over the world and the born and capillar diffusion of television are the best `` friends  of advertising s lies .there are a lot of psicology studies about human behavior to constuct a perfect advertise .there are also some ways to test if an advertise has been remembered by the pubblic or not .somebody makes a lot of research about behavior in the super matrkets or into the commercial centers , too .nowdays yoo can assert that adverisements do not sell a product but they sell a dream .they imply . ..fulfill that dream is easy : `` you only need to buy thath product or servce !however in the real life is different becuse what television spot suggest you , it does not occur .for example the washing products never function on their own and at the first time yuo use them . .when you wash something , usually you need to wash it more and moer to clean if not it rest with rubbish on !as i have arleady wrote i am not happy about this thing but i hope that people will chaege this way to sell . .i do not know how people can change this thing but i am sure that is occur in few years .
