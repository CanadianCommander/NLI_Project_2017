how often have people traveled on their own ?in groups ?by couple or with their class ?what is the best way to travel to a country ?opinions differ depending on people , but i believe that the best way to travel and to learn about a country is by being led by a tour guide .first , a tour guide can help us travelling in the country .i remember the time i travelled in italy with my parents , we took a guide who made us a visit of the entire rome .he knew every corner of the city as if it was himself .we took the subway and we were amazingly surprised of how many stations and changements we had to make .because we could not speak italian , travelling alone would have been much more difficult without a guide .thanks to our tour guide , we were spared interminable hours of wander in the intricate streets of rome .secondly , a tour guide can give us some historical background that are specific to the country or to the region .our italian guide , named gino , explained to us in details the history of the coliseum .we thought we knew already enormously about the site , for we have read many books about it , but we never knew how it was built , in how much time it was built , and why was it a phenomenon in rome .he explained us how italy undergoed a chaotic period during the civil war and the second world war , facts that have not always been explained concisely .but he also talked to us about italian legends , that are only known by italians .he also familiarized us with the traditional italian music which originally bloomed during the renaissance .gino also talked to us about the great thinkers , mathematicians , musicians , politicians and dictators of their country and i had to admit that i could never have thought about them if we were not guided by gino .thirdly , if we are not completly familiar with a country s language , people , or food , a tour guide can always facilitate our task .i remember how lost my parents and i were the first day we arrived in rome .we could nt speak italian and because we were tourists , some italians took advantage of the situation to make us pay more than the regular prices in restaurants .gino got furious against the waiter and when we asked him what happened , we were horrified to realize that the waiter wanted to make us pay the bread , the table , the glasses , the fourks and knives .apart from this little misunderstanding , gino always had great museum , restaurants , bars , adresses .he would recommend us the best italian pasta dishes and would bring us the great comedy shows !he would also bargain with street sellers so that we could afford cheaply a dolce et gabbana pair of glasses or a perfect imitation of a gucci bag .i believe that my experience in rome clearly demonstrated the fact that it is best to travel somewhere by being led by a tour guide .for he is more experienced and familiar to his country s lifestyle and people .
