many of the greatest discoveries like america and everest were made by men who werent afraid to explore uncharted territories .who werent afraid to lose what they already got even their lives in order to achive their goal .to create something new and something with a greater value you have to stop doing what others are doing and search for a better way of doing it .you have to invent your solutions take the risks which scares away all the others .i imagine people thought edison was not bright at all untill he find the light bulbs .many successful people tend to pursue their goals no matter how risky they are and how irrational they seem to others .sticking on what is known to be right way of things will not achive you to the better .you will do your job but you wont have the chance to know of a better way .walking on the path of others will only get you where others were .while this may be sufficient for some i think there is a reason for all of us and its up to us to find it .we have the chance to make our lives better and we have to pursue it no matter what .
