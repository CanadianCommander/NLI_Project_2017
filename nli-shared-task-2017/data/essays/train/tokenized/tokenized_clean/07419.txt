i disagree with the given statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .although one may arrive to this conclusion by observing a particular group or kind of people .however , one should remember these groups do not represent the whole of todays young generation .i disagree with the idea because i myself have seen many instances of community work done by school and college students .many social work organizations accross the country constitutes of very young people .for example in almost all institutes of excellence in higher study through out the country ( india ) , they have a credit course on social and community service namely ( national social services ) .in this course students try and help their community by doing various social works in their free times .for example teaching english to village children , educating villagers about certain diseases and hygine conditions , etc .also , since this statements seems to be a realtive one .like comparing todays younger generation with that of past .i dont think scenario has changed a lot with time , i mean youth today are aware of their responsibilities and duties towards the community as much as their ancestors .we can find all kinds of peoples at any given time period , moreover , there are no conclusive evidences that section of youths working for the community have increased or reduced with time .according to me nowadays the young crowd is more informed about its duties and responsibilities .it is quite evident from the fact that competition is increasing in every area .more and more people want to become something be it doctor , engineer or scientist , they all are willing to serve the community in one way or another .the above example may be a bit confusing as , how these academic advances can be related to helping the communities .but , in my view , a student studying engineering or medicine is surely serving the community , by providing it with doctors and engineers for the future .to summarize , i disagree with the given statement due to lack of any given statistics and my own personal experiences .infact , according to my point of view the young people nowadays are more aware and responsible towards their community .
