it is commonplace to criticize our educational system .many scholars pretend that the current learning organization in our colleges is too theoretical and it has to be more pragmatic .others assert the contrary .the issue of the importance of conceiving ideas and concepts is a controversial one .i totally agree with this fact and there are several reasons of that .firstly , students have to go to school in order to learn theories .secondly , everybody has to improve his or her analytical skills for the rest of his or her life .thirdly , reflexion enacts better in order to solve a problem .first , the main purpose of the school system is to prepare the young people for the adult life .in fact , students firstly have to learn a lot of things in vast fields .it could be quite impossible to learn without books or explanations done by a teacher .having a good introduction about a new grammar rule can help the student to figure out how this rule can be use in the current life .second , schools have to learn how to analyze subjects .only a performing educational organization can transfer knowledges with analytical techniques .it is very important for students to have the good tools in order to learn perfectly .in fact , the conceptualization of an issue permits to understand the reality .for example , when someone is becoming sick , a doctor has to have an overview of all symptoms ( facts ) , but he also needs to understand the concept of the illness : only his analytical skills can help him .third , before acting , thinking .this issue is crucial , but everybody can understand the value of these words .learning contributes to help us in our decision/making process .for instance , you have to understand the ideas , before you decide to do something or not .driving is the best example , if you do nt want to crash everytime .in conclusion , i completely agree with the issue of learning concepts and ideas .having a good theoretical background , improving his or her analitycal skills and thinking before acting are the best reasons in my point of view .
