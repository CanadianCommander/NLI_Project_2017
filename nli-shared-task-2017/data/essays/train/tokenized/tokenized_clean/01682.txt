there are many opinions occuring about whether young people or old people enjoy life more .i actually do not agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  at all .i do nt think that old people have more fun in life than their younger companions either .but i am not saying that not anyone on earth enjoys his or her life .i am just trying to say that it depends on the person himself regardless of his age .a man , 80 years of age could be the richest man on earth but may still not be satisfied with his life because he wants to be young again .therefore he does not enjoy life .and on the other side a teenager is unhappy about his life because he does nt have the money and right to do whatever he wishes to do because he still lives in his parents house .all the teenager wants is to get older , so that he can do all the things that he always wanted to do ( and of course the money to do it ) .and the funny thing is that both illustrations could be the exact same person , only in different life stages .but it can be different , too .as a young person you can enjoy life by going to school , meeting friends , doing sports , etc .and just because of the fact that you are old does not mean that you can not have the same fulfillment in life as a younger people do .you only do different things which you could have never thought of when you were younger .so what does that mean ?you could have all the things you ve always wanted and still be unhappy .it does nt matter if someone is young or someone is old .if that particular person does not have the right attitude to make the most out of the situation he will never be happy and finally enjoy life .a young person can enjoy life as well as an old person does .it is only important how he thinks of himself .i believe it is your attitude that determines what kind of a life you can have .you can enjoy life or make it a terrifying time while being on this earth .nobody can make you feel happy , but you .
