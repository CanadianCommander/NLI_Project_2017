no , i not really agree about this statement .i think that , in twenty years , the number of cars in use will be increase in the world .but i think the increase will be less important in the developped countries .in fact , in each developed country , the increase of cars is already done . ..for exemple , in france , it was during the 70s , with the background of the economic increase , the unemployement rate was very down .the french people bought a lot of cars during this period .almost 40 years later , french people buy still cars . ..but in general , it s to replace the oldest .they just change the model of their car .now , each member of the family had his car . ..the wife and the husband , the young adult boy or girl . ..it s the same in america , in great britain , ...in the developped countries .so , in fact , in twenty years , i think that in the developped countries there will be fewer cars in use than tere are today .but in the other countries of the world , it s not the same situation .i think that in the countries on the way of the economic increase , the number of cars will strongly increase .for exemple , china , the country that everybody is talking about and which is going to become one of the most important enconomic country in the world in a very short moment .the actuel economic increase in china
