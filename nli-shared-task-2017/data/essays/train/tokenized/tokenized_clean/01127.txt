in my opinion , young people nowadays really do not give enough time to helping their communities .i can certainly defend this opinion relying on many experiences that i have been having since i started to feel myself like an adult .these experiences even have led me to the thought that the young people , including the teenagers as well as the university post-graduates are becoming more and more selfish in todays life .first of all , communication among people living in a same territory or among relatives , or even within the small family is weakening due to the new commmunicating ways of the modern life .the last improvements in media , for example has had a great impact on the way of preferences people make in their relationships .i think that people prefer to get amused by watching an act instead of talking to each other .telling stories has alredy been replaced with watching films .so , as result of this change example , people meet each other more rarely that they met in the past when there was not any tv or any radio .this causes human beings to be strangers to each other , to be less emotional , and show less emphaty agains others .according to me , emphaty is the basis of the desire to help any person .emphaty causes people to understand their feelings about a situation or about a specific point of view .in a difficulty an individual may face at any time in his/her life , i.e. in hard times , he/she can get the help he/she needs from a person who especially can feels the similar intimately , or , at least , can understands his/her feelings .when this is possible , i think that the possible helper will think of his/her own benefits at the end , not at the beginning .regarding my own experiences that i have mentioned i had in the first paragraph of this writing , the school life has been the first time i faced selfishness .on the other hand , no other experienced could show to me selfishness better than the work life now does .in my daily work life , i see how people sometimes present my studies as
