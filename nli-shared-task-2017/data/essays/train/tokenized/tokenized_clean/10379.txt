i agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .advertisement itself is the way the company tell the people what they are making for them , the main propuse of making a advertisement is to convey people to buy their product .it is the same as you are applying for college .you do want the admission officer to see the advantages you have , and avoid the disadvantages as possible as you can .by doing so , you are tring to perswade the admission officer to let you enter the college .these is just as same as what companies doing to their coustmers by making advertisements .think about it , if there are two apples on the table , one is big and red while another is small and green , which one would you prefer by just looking at them ?of course the one that looks better !when we are watching an advertisement , the product are often looks really good , or even better than they really are .however , that not because the advertisement maker is cheating us , they just want us to feel better by the first looking at the product since we had never seen it before .for example , when a professional photographor is taking pictures of a new product , say , wine , for a company , he may use the mixture of red ink and water instead of using the real wine .becasuse when he put the mixture under the light , it look more clear than wine and people would like these kind of things .when people have a good first visual impress of the product , they would possiblely going to buy it , and before they really hold the product in their hands , it have nothing to do wheater the product is good or not .since then , advertisements have finished their job .
