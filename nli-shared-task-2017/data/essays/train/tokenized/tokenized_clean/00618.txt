a man goes for an interview thinking he is right for the job .he does not know that only bookish knowledge in his related subject will not help in getting that job .neways , he goes to the interview and he is questioned about many other topics in addition to his related field and obviously due to his lack of knowlegde he is unable to give the satisfactory answers to the questions .this situation would not have arised had he been an expert in other subjects as well .hence i am for the topic that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .nobody can be perfect .learning is a process we have to undergo throughout our lives .nobody can succeed if he knows only a restricted source of information .a person should hence plan what he is goin to learn during his core education years which begin for most people at highschool and continue throughout college .specialization is not a bad activity but it is not a smart decision to specialize in one subject at the cost of the others .when speaking in public or even when talkin amongst friends for that matter woud nt it be great if one was filled with academic knowledge and intellectual odassity ?nowadays people are specializing in more than one subject .has anyone ever wondered why ?all this is being done due to a change in thinking and a new approach of wider horizons and not a mental block that one should be efficient only in his or her related field of work .a person can grow his worth by havin broader knowledge of various academic subjects as he will be able to tackle practical problems faced in life better his vast source of information and the large bank of knowledge he accumulated in his learning years .the world is changing , the challenges are becoming greater , cut-throat competition is taking place nowadays and thus only the best of the best can survive in todays world where people are continously striving to reach higher in life .all this can be made a lot easier if a person has a varied source of knowledge to bank upon and thus people should have a broad knowledge ofn academic subjects than to specialize in one specefic subject .
