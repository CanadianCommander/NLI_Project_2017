i agree with the view that in future there will be fewer cars than there are now .on the one hand , the cars are one of the most convenient mode of transportation and also the most popular one .on the other hand , the factors such as growth in population , scarcity of land and concentration of population in the urban centers indicates towards a future situation where we might actually see a reduction of cars in future .in the final analysis , there are more and stronger indications for decrease in the number of cars in future .first , due to the rising population and overcrowding in the cities , it has become extremely difficult to travel in cars as there are frequent traffic jams and lack of parking space .the other modes of transportation such as buses and trains are more convenient and faster .further , since most of the cars are owned by people in cities the number of cars will decerases due to the above factors in the coming times .second , the problem of pollution and overcrowding in the cities due to the increase in the number of cars have forced governments in countries like singapore impose high taxes on purchase of vehicles .they have also imposed toll charges for entering in the main city areas .thus , the government regulations can also discourage people from purchasing more cars and this will contribute to an overall reduction of cars in future .third , the probelm of the scarcity of non-renewable fuels is pushing up the fuel prices everyday , making it more and more difficult to travel in cars .it has already led to the increase in popularity of the cheaper public transportation , this has been the case with trains in mumbai ( india ) , where many people who used to travel in cars have shifted to travelling in trains and for these people new air conditioned trains have also been started .finally , the development of the alternative means of transportations like improved buse service , better network of trains , etc can again lead to a reduction in the number of cars purchased by people and contribute to a reduction of the total number of cars in times to come .thus , for the reasons given above i believe that in future cars will be fewer in number than they are now .
