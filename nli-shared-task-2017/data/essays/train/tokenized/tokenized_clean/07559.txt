i completely agree with the statement that it is essential for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .this exercise is even more essential during early stages in their development .this is because understanding ideas and concepts helps to develop a student s mind .understanding an idea or concept encourages the student to apply his/her mind and come up with logical explanations , solutions and conclusions .the student tends to develop analytical thinking and reasoning abilities .he/she tends to becomes inquisitive and curious , constantly seeking information and looking out for answers .he/she tends to participate more in discussions and debates , which help him to learn from other people and undertand their line of thinking .he/she also tends to become more creative and contributive .and , these are essentially qualities which employers seek when hiring potential employees .this is the reason that companies stress more on personal interviews rather than written tests when hiring .they look out for the essential qualities of analytical thinking , reasoning and creativity , all which stem from having the ability to understand ideas and concepts and connect things .learn facts is an exercise which is essentially done over a period of a person s lifetime .often , facts that students learn in their school and college life may become outdated as science and technology progresses and new inventions and discoveries are made .hence to remain updated in a competitive world , a person is required to learn facts throughout his lifetime .in conclusion , learning facts does improve a student s knowledge base but unless he is equipped with analytical thinking and reasoning abilities he is less likely to make an impact which will help him to succeed in the longer run .
