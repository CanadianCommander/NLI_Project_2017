i there was nt twenty years a go , but i know that in that period there were fewer cars in use than there are today .i think that there are many historical reasons to explain the huge spread of the car in the last twenty years .starting thanks to henry ford and his way of production of car it was possible to start to make car at minor cost and in a minor time .thaks to this starting improving the car has became a common meand of trasportation .in fact , a production less expensive has permitted to reduce the price to buy a car and always more people can have the possibility to buy it .a second historical reasons that have caused a big speard of the car is the economy improve of the society .after the industrial revolution , the factory has became the most common way to prodution .with the arrive of the factory most people start to work in a factory .during this period the society was growed , the trade was improve and therefore also the weaht of the people was increase .thank to this better economic situation of the people it was growed also the number of people that can buy a car .another element that during the history has had effects on the spread of the sell of the car amoung people is the improving of the tecnology .chiefly in the last years , which the improving of the tecnology has gone at a big level , always more cars have made and more cars have sail .in conclusion i want to underline that the car is a very common mean of trasportation , but nowadays there are too many people that use the cars .in fact the use of the car cause much pollution at our environment .i know that tha car is the more easy maen of trasportation , but i know also that if all the people of the word use always the car , also for do few km , too many environment problems will born .
