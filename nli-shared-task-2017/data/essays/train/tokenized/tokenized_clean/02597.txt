do most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are ?as a source of information i first want to analyse the purpose of advertisement .another good way to find an answer obviously is to examine some examples , which will follow .much money is spend on advertisement .the simple purpose is to increase the ammount of sold products .the most simple way to do so would be to show the product in the best light .weaknesses will not find their way in an advertisement .therefore the product should seem very good , which in average will be much better than it really is .let us find out if advertisement takes this way of promoting goods .one of the most succesfull products of the last years is the ipod , a portable music player .with the succes came a lot of advertisement .the printing campaign simply shows the outline of a figure in black with a white ipod .as the photo gives a fair impression how the product really looks like and there is hardly writte anything on it , we can not pretend that the product seems much better than it really is .take an advertisement of a watch .an important manufactor advertises with a sailing picture .there is only little information about the watch , concluding that it fits perfectly for sailing .again there is not so much written about the product that we could say it was made better than it is .although there is some advertisement showing a product in the best light , most advertisement seems to work differently .it is not the product , which is sold , it is the brand , the lifestyle , the image .and therefore something invisible is added to the product , which makes it seem much different than it really is .
