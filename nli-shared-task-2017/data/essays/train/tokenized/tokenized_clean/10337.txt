in present scenario of diversification of knowledge as well as introduction of new subject everyday , it is a matter of great concern among people of academic fraternity that to which subject they should concentrate upon .whether it is better to have a diversified knowledge or to have a specialization in a particular subject .it is a very arguable matter .before rendering my opinion let s analyse the possible pros and cons .being specialist in one subject does nt mean that the person is not able to learn other subject .it has been proved time and again by different great people in history that , a person may have equal mastry over two subjects of opposite nature .i would like to present example of the great leonardo the vincii who is a scientist , sculpturist , painter , philosopher and many thing more , at the same time .now a days invention of computer has made life much easier and knowledge easy to access .with the help of computer and setellite technolgy we can save our time much and devout it over other minor subjects also .also in research area the demarcation between subjects is on the verge of extinction .for example the cappilary rise equation in physics is given by a scientist from medical stream .in my opinion a person should have to diversify himself in multiple dimension as much as possible .however as english proverb goes `` a coin has two faces  , persons having opposite opinion may have some reasonable grounds .but in my opinion pros overweigh the cons .a person should be multideciplinary genious rather than specialist in one subject .
