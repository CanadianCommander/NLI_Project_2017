is the world a circle ?it sure is .when the first cars appeared at the beginning of the 20th century , ( thanks to the great industrial revolution europe was living ) it was such a phenomenon that in twenty / thirty years almost eighty per cent of the population had one .nowadays , there are at least 2 cars ( if not even more . .. )per family : do we really need that many cars ?definately not .in fact , in the past few years , the number of cars sold has largely reduced .and hopefully , from now on , it ll reduce more and more .personally i think this is because people have finally got the point that they d better spend their money on something else , maybe more useful and long-lasting .someone might object that cars are useful and that is true , but it s a need that can easily be replaced in several ways and for different reasons , first of all because of the pollution .using public trasportation would have many benefits : the environment would take a breath and there would also be much less traffic .exactly like with kids when they have a new toy . ..they play all the time only with that specific thing just because it s `` new  .the same thing happens with adults .years ago cars were new and not having one was a shame .instead , now , not having a car is a sign of intelligence , a way of distinguishing ourselves in a selfish world of omologation where even dangerous or harmful things are used .so , in conclusion , the world is a cirlce , a huge chain with high and low points .cars already had their moment of glory , but from now on , they have to leave the seat to something else .till humans wo nt get tired of that , too . ..ready to start the cirlce again . ..
