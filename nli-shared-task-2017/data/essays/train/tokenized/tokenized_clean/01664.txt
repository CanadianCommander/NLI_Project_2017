today , many people have a car or even many cars , however will it be the same in twenty years ?many clues show that things will change in the future because cars are dangerous for the environment , oil will depletel in few years , but also because cars are not healthy .now , everyone knows that cars are polluting , and as a consequence , are very bad for the environment .scientists try to make cars which pollute less , but currently it does not exist a car which does not pollute .i think it is very important to be aware of the environment problem and to be concerned about the global warming .the first step to reduce the global warming may be to reduce , or even to stop the using of cars .there could be a solution to this problem if scientists would build clean cars , but it is not the case yet .an other important thing is that there will be a lack of oil in few years .currently , with no oil a car can not work .so if scientists do not make cars without oil , there will not be any cars when oil will deplete on the earth .finally , cars do not help people to be healthy and do not incite them to walk , which is in a way quite normal since people prefer to choose the easiest and most cumfortable things .while the obesity keeps growing , people use their car instead of walking , even for a short time .i thing people should walk more often and not use their cars every time they have to go out .this is why i think , and i hope , there will be fewer cars in use in the twentiy years .maybe cycles could replace cars , it would make people more sporty and healthier and it would be better for the environment .
