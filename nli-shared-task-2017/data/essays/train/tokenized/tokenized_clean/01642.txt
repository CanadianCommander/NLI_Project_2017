as a college student study in taiwan , based on what i do in the past years and my observation on my friends , i agree with that young people nowadays actually do not give enough time to helping their communities .i know i am kind of reluctant to admit the truth , yet i think the following reasons could explain why we are not able to do so .in the first place , we are actually too busy in our school lifes .as you know , people at this age are expected by elders or even by themselves to be as competitive as we could be .this means we have to spend most of our time on taking lectures in different fields , learning precious experiences from dealing with club affairs , and some of us even already having internships in company .in the rest of our time , there are a lot of reading materials and projects waiting to be treated .and as a human being , we need time to play as well as to take a rest .it is too hard for the young people to put their attention on the need of their communities if they are already bearing so many requirements .the other reasons is that the concept of helping each other in a community has not yet formed in my culture .i mean , it is not part of our life .we are told since young to take care of yourself first then consider to give the rest to others .so if a new idea is introducing to my country -- like encouraging youngsters to do something for the place they dwell in -- it must first serves as a requirement in school .my college implemented a new policy last year that every students should earn at least 36 service hours before they can graduate .yet the service on school campus is also counted in the required hours .the result is that , most of the students still do not learn the spirit of devoting to their community .i know the fact is quite daunting to those who wish the new generation to do more to where it live in ; however , the reasons above which stop us from that also discourages me .i hope things would get better
