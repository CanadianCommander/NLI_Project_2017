i agree with this statement .successful always come from trying and taking risk .people in the world all knew that if you want to become successful , you got to try .you may learn a great experience while you are trying new things .there might have something that you were afraid of and never want to try at all .however by an accident you got to do this thing and you actually did it , this will give you encourae and you will feel very proud of yourself .this is how successful works .those people ca nt become successful is because they do nt want to try , everythings just stay the same , always do the thing that they already know how to do well .new things always let you grow up , if people rather stay the same they wo nt grow at all .i was a very good example that rather try new things instead of do things that i already know how to do well .when i was young , i do nt know how to ride bicycle , and i was afraid of it .however i keep telling myself that `` if you wo nt try , you will never knew how to ride a bicycle .and at first it was very horrible , i always fall down and get hurts .although i was not very good , i still try the new thing and i knew that i could become better and better .because of this thought and persverience , in the end i know how to ride a bicycle .form my example we can see the different between try new things and stay the same .we always afraid new things taht we did not know about it .but think about it , if you try the new things you will learn a new experience and you might like it after you try , so do nt just stay the same , try new things .
