everything in life had to go new ways at one point .evolution for example .without going new ways , humans maybe would still live in caves if they existed at all !to connect this example with todays life , you only have to look at famous people like bill gates for instance .he tried new things , and today he is one of the most famous people in the world , pushed the technology a huge step forward and ows up to that more money than i could ever count .of course , on the one hand i have to say , that you are on the safer side of life if you only do the things you know you can do .because you are selfconfident in what you do , and you will do it the correct way without having to worry about not solving a problem perfectly , for example given by your boss at work .but on the other hand everyone wants to improve and be ` as good as can be  , and that is not possible withoug moving on .a good exampel is a tennisplayer .if he would never change his way of playing , everyone would know how to beat him , and he could quit his tennis career .that s why he is trying to learn new techniques .and this was only one example .another one could be , that he gets bored of playing and feels unsatisfied his whole life through .in every part of life it is the same .you want to improve , so you have to accept the fact , that you have to try and learn new things .so i do agree with this statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what the already know how to do well  .because mankind wants to move on - thats in its nature .and you can only move on if you try new things .
