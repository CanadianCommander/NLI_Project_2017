todays marketing is based on the announcement of products that seem better than they really are .publicity is every where and every time .for example , you are watching t.v. show and it has a lot of comercials if you notice , all of the comercials are publicity and there are also channels for t.v. shopping and all day you hear about a new chop machine for your kitchen or a new mickey mouse phone for kids , things like that .the problem is that you think that these things are usefull and the reality is that they are not even necessary at home but they make you want more and more and more .on the other hand , the radio , you are driving and listening to some music and suddenly , a comercial announcing that wall mart is offering new , shiny and useful microwaves and they are really cheap .what happens then ?you buy the microwave and in 2 months or less it burns or just stopps working .you go to wall mart to complain and they tell you , excuse me miss but that microwave was on sale , so you just think , what a waste of money .although , publicity is in the news that we read every day , every day there is a complete page of new and cheap cell phones .not all the publicity and marketing are bad or a waste of money , there are some good stores and nice products that you can buy that are really needy and not too expensive , so not all the publicity is bad .another thing with bad publicity are the losing of weigth pills , they make believe people that by taking some pills they are going to be like britney spears and then this girls drive anorexics or bullimics and things like that .so a good publicity has to be trustable .
