i agree with this statement .in fact i think that learning facts is useful , but not the important part of the study .if you learn only facts without understanding the concepts of what you are studiyng , you will not have a complete knowledge about it , and so you will have only a superficial one of the theme .then , having a superficial knowledge about the theme means that you are not able to make yourself a critical opinion about that and that you wo nt be able to discuss it in a complete way .another reason is that facts are forgotten rapidly , with the result that in a short time you will not remember anything about the topic , whereas concepts and ideas remain more deeply in the brain .i know that there are many areas of knowledge and in some of these areas , such as engeneering for example , it is more important to learn facts and numbers than to understand facts .but also in these cases a learning only based on facts is not effective : for example if you do nt understand a physic process you wo nt be able to make exercizes based on it , or however if you would find an exercize a little different from the one you have studied , you would nt be able to solve it .this is important not only at school but also in work , in which if you understand deeply a process , you are able to manage it and the people who have nt understood it
