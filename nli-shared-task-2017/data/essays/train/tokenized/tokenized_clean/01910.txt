many people are called specialists because they are specialized in one specific subject .i think specialists are needed in the society to figure out solutions for many problems .however , i agree with the statement that it is better to hav broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .only a few initelligent people can be specialists .specializing in one certain subject is very hard and requires much concentration on it and intelligence for it .ordinally people can not compete with such intelligent people who are very into it .also , they must be bored to do one thing continuously and forever .intelligent people can do the specialized work and solving problems for others too .knowing wide range of things helps socialize people .people can not communicate without common topics .broad knowledge gives people a lot of ideas of topic and enables communicate whoever show up .for example , a couple of people are enjoying talking about english literatures .if one knows some about them , one can get in the conversation as well .on the other hand , if one has no idea with them , one can never find a way to communicate with them .knowledge of many academic subjects gives many choices to people .if a person has knowledge of math , english , and laws , he or she can pick any one of them .if a person specialized in one subject , he or she can not change his or her mind in the middle of the way .it is scary if a person realizes his or her interest is different from what he or she specialized in .that is because she or he has no knowledge about anything else .he or she needs go back to the very first stage of the other choice .overall , people need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjecet because intelligents can specialize one subject for other people , broad knowledge helps to communicate with other people , and people can get change their mind whenever they want .
