although i can understand why some peolpe have the impression that young people today are not engaging themselves enough to helping their communities , i disagree with this statement .i have three reasons for my opinion .first , in my view , young people have to dedicate most of their time to their education and career .as the unemployment rate in most countries increases year after year this is the only way for young people to asure themselves a job in the future .for example , young people have to attend college or university , they have classes during the day and usually homework to do in the evening .some students also have to work part-time to be able to afford the university fees .second , a lot of young people are planing their own family when they are still young .when you have children on your own you need time to raise them .children need a lot of attention as they always have so many questions about the world and a lot of reasearch papers state that the intellectual capabilities of children are influenced most at a very young age .so parents should take all the time they need to raise their children and explain everything to them .finally , i am convinced that even though young people do not have a lot of free time , still many of them do engage themselves to helping their communities .i would like to give two examples of the community i live in .in our community especially young people are part of the first aid team of the local red cross .they spend their time doing different volunteer services , like medical help or entertainement for older people .furthermore , the fire department of our town has a special youth organization for people aged below 17 years .for the last five years the volunteer members of this youth organization have increased steadily .concluding , i think that young people today have a lot of important activities and obligations like their own education or the founding of their own family which prevent them from giving more time to helping their communities .but i also have the impression that young people still engage in their free time as much as they can to improve their communities  conditions .
