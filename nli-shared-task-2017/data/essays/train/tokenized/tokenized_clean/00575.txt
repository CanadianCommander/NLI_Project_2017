i always believe that one of the biggest trait for a successful person would definetly be his ability to try out new things rather than persisting doing things he knew best .so i would definetly agree with given the statement .lets take an example to better illustrate the stand on the topic , thomas edison was the one who invented the bulb .he would never have invented the bulb if he did not take the risk and try some thing different .what could the effect of this be ?we would have still be sitting with candles in between us for lighting .so it was this ability of his to try new theores and thoughts made him successful .secondly i would like to take the example of the father of my nation mahatma ghandhi who was greatly successful because of his new ways to fight the british rule .he came up with what they call now the ghandian principles of non - violent way of fighting aginest the british rule .his new and risky ways helped to win the independence to our country , much againest the more established ways of using violence for freedom fighting .ghandhi for one an established lawer in south africa when he started his new non violent ways of protesting againest the harsh authorities .fur better understanding take for instance a student who is good at his achademics but not very good in his communication skills , if he wants to get placed in a good company after his study it would be really hard for him to be successful .so here although the person is good at his achademicshe needs to concentrate on his communication skills in order to be successful .this stament greatly works in the case of computer programmers , computer programmers are always confronted with the task of finding newer ways to program in order to increase the efficiency and throughput of the target systems , and so the most successful men for instance microsoft have always been ones those who did things differently .so to sum it up , though it is important to do well what you know , you always need to have the desire to try out new thigs and the pluck to take risks to come out on top and be successful .this has always been the case with most of the successful men in history .
