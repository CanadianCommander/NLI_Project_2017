from my point of view , i do not think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .some people believe this becasue they think that in twenty years , perhaps , the world will have changed so much that we will use flying objects to go from one place to another and that , moreover , we will transport things by putting them into a machine , pressing a button , and , suddenly , they will appear thousands of kilometres away from where they were .when i was young everybody said that in the year two thousand everything was going to be different and that what i ve said above would have already happened , but these did nt become true .nowadays things are quite similar to what they were twenty years ago .cars are so important in our lifes that we can not live without them .nowadays we need our cars to transport things , to go to many places where public transport do nt go and to feel a bit more free .on the other hand , it s true that if public transports became cheaper and quicker , many people would nt need their car , and they would take public transport , but , what about feeling free ?our society needs to feel really free , and to feel that they can go wherever they want , whenever they want .we are absolutely under control in our cities and in our countries and , as i think , cars give us this bit of freedom that we do not have in many other parts of our lifes .for all this reasons i think that in twenty years , there wo nt be fewer cars in use than there are today , although i do think that the number of cars wo nt be growing so quickly as it is growing today .
