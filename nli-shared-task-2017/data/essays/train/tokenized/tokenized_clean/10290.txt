i think to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is good for people than to specialize in one specific subjuct .if someone only study about mathematics , he or she ca nt make a life more variously and miss many useful information for survive .i would present two specific reasons to support my idea .first , a person who study only one subject ca nt sustain their lifes well .people are social beings so they have to learn about many things to survive .for example , if a professor of the history learn about history he or she could be poor because lackness of economic knowledge .my major is history , so i always see my professors who studying their own intrest .however , they are not good at financial techquinics , so they to miss much money that they could earn .if they could earn much more money than now , they can concentrate on their subjects as they do nt worry about thier financial problems .secondly , one subject is related with other subjects densely .if you want to study history you have to learn other languages , literatures , philosophis and so on .when i read a book about roman history , i also need to study about their literatures and philosophies .in addition , i have to learn about other languages if i want to read materials from other countries .it only allow me to understand specific factors accurately .to conclude , i think to study board knowledge of many academics becaus of its useful facor to survive and helpful factor to study your own interest subject .
