`` in twenty years there will befewer cars in use than there are today  .this statement can tell me a person who do nt belive in the progres of any cities .there are the people , that say this , because they use the car only twice on the week , but for example , an transporter that use the truck or the her car for th eher job , he can not think minimally , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .in my opinion is that there are will be many cars in use in the next future .one reason , for my opinion , is that the cars is one important part of progres , because what will began the world , is there decrease the number of car .i think will there are more problem on the trasport sector , prahps the only point better of view is that there are littel pollution on the air , that we breathing every day .to resolve this problem thare are different solution , that can be an change of kind of car s engine , as a engine that has as power the idrogean or the light s solar .therefore , i hope a world with few car , but this is not possible , because the people is increasing and they need job , and last ring of this cirle is a transport with cars .
