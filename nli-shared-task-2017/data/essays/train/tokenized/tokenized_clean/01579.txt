yes , i agree with the statement wich says the it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concept .i think thet it is right because i have never had so much memory for name , dates and fact , but i had more memory for concept and ideas .i think olso thet if one person can understand the concept of a problem will be able to describe the fact .dates , names and fact can be remembred reading many times the tex , but the concepts no .concepts must be expleined very well by a teacer , and it is important thet students can ask him some question if the concept is not so much clear .another very important thing is thet the teacher must be very able to explein the conjcept : he must speak slow and he must be shure thet all the students have understood whot he wonts to say .to be shure he should ask his students if the concept is clear every time before go on with his explenation .the fact thet it si more important for students to understand ideas is more valid for logical and scientifical disciplines , were the most important thing is to understand the method .disciplines like story and geography need thet students can remember facts and name , but olso in this case it is very impotant thet students understand the concept as , for exemple , the ways for an historical fact has happened , wich are the motives thet makes it to happens .for the study of geographie it si not important to know just where a place is situeted , but it is impostant to understand the culture of thet town .
