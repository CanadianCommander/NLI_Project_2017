in my opinion , it s better to have a broad knowledge of manyacademic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjectbecause you reduce your choice of lifestyle and have to study formany more years on witch you could already afford a nice job if youhad chosen to study many academic subjects .by example , aperson studying medecine academic subjects will choose tospecialize himself or herself to be a chirugian or a dentist , but oncethe choice is done , you have to study everything again to changeyour job .if someone wishes to specialize in one specific subject heor she might get more into depth witch is a good caracteristic onceyou re looking for a job , but you could also apply for a job that whichis nt as good as you cool have refering to the studies you ` veaccomplished .moreover , when you specialize yourself , you have tostudy longer to get your master degree and your doctora .on theother hand , if you study economics or marketing you have a muchbigger choice and you can work in different departement .when youstudy economics , you can also specialize in one specific subject but most people end there studies at the master degree which leadsyou to lots of differents jobs such as marketing , public relation , andmany other .in conclusion , we could say that both thoeries lead youto a nice life and that the choice dependant of every students .however this choice can be made only once you get to this point ofyour studies because you might descover a lot of new things duringyour student periode .finally we could ask ourselves which of thesetwo types of studies leads you faster to the job you ever dreamed ofas you re a child .
