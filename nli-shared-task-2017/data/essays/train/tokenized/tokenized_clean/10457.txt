when it comes to choosing whether you prefers broad range of knowledges or just one specialized knoweldge , there could be a lot of opinions just as different strokes for different folks .some of my opposite numbers would try to win me over by saying ` one specialized knowledge is better  .they would come up understandable reasons like ` if you tried to learn a lot of things at one time it will simply overwhelm your self and you may not be able to master just one knowledge pluently  .their reason is quiet acceptable and very tempting however if i am allow to choose one treasure from the various shiny ones i would claim my prize by saying ` i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects  .there are various reasons to support my idea .first our lives are limited to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a computer .so what i figure is if you have limited time to learn might as well learn much stuff as possible .the second reason is that we are living in fast evolving society and i think the era of one speciallized knowledge is over .people with broad range of knowledges are treated more nicer than people who just specialized in one academic subjects .let me give you one example .in our country it is very hard to get a reliable job .we have to faster than others , smater than others , even richier than others .at the time like this specializing one academic subjects is like a sucide attempt because jobs are limited and companies are looking for more intelligent people .come to think of it the idea which my opposite numbers are suggesting is very reasonable .but i think what they are claming is kind of far from the reality .besides i do nt think my opinion is not a far cry from the given subject nethier .so in conclusion i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have just one specialized academic subject .
