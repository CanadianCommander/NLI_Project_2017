ideas and concepts will play a major role in the development any product or component .so , i strongly accept that a student has to understand ideas and concepts .in todays world we have come accrosed many robust and complicated products .for example , cars , computers and many automated machines .these products were developed by engineers by understanding proper background information of it and its working principle , to get all these things done we need to understand the concepts and ideas of it .for example , to design a bike , we have to understand the working principle and what is exactly required in order to make it work in an efficient way .when we understand the above need we can have an idea to fabricate it .today we have many students who are very dull in their studies and they just memorise the answers and reproduce the same in the exam papers .but they dont understand the concept of the chapter or working of a particular componentand , eventually when they finish there educations they will not have ability to implement the concept to develop a product because they have not understood the concept well .so , todays science and technology has many complicated concepts were students are finding difficult to learn it .sometimes , facts also required to learn from facts .for example , when a solid object is immersed in water , an equall amount of water is displaced out which is equal to the weight of the solid object whic is a fact that can be seen .this information is very usefull for marine engineers which is got by a fact .so , i always understand the concept and ideas in any subject rather then giong by a fact .i have done this from my childhood and helped me a lot to learn so that i can implement the same to invent more and more products which is favorable to the people .
