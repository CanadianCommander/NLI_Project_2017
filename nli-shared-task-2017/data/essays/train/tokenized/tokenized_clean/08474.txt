yong people are enjoy life more than older people do .i am agree with this statement .now in present days young people are enjoyed well with copared to old days .because at this present time they have so many entertining equipments and these all are not available that olden days .and the world is developing rapidly .at a time the young people also worked hard to reach their goals and to reched their ambitions .they are doing hardwork and enjoy at a time .they are seperated their time for working and for enjoying .now these present days so many young people are worked in many great companies and corporate companies , then they all are worked weekly five days for company and remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family .so young people also do hardwork but they make some shedule and follow that .now so many young people are worked under some company or worked under some institute , but these companies and institutes are build by old people .so old people are worked in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run that institutes and companies .from the above two sentences i can say that old people are worked hard than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels .and these present days also have some yong managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists , but they all are get that companies and that industrys from their parents and they run that companies verywell .for suppose anil abani is great indusrialist and great managing director for relience companies .but he get them from his father and he also workhard and developing their companies and developing their shares in present market .so finally i am supporting that the young people are enjoy their life more than older people and also they are workedhard and get good positions in their lifes .and for hardworking older people one of the best example is bill gates .he is the owner of microsoft company .but now his child that means his younger child are doing enjoy well and they are get that property from their parents and they are develope that company with hardwork .
