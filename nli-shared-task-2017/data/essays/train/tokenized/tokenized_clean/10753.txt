recently , there has been an argument as to whether a person should buy a car if he or she can or should keep using the public tranportation among my classmates .as a person using the public transportation for most of the time , i decided that , we should not consider this problem further because there will be less number of cars in use in twenty years than in today .i provided some strong supports and evidences for this thought .first of all , in twenty year , i think that most of the people will be much more aware of the value of public transportation !if the number of cars increase with time , there will be a great need for more highways !since we are limited with the earth s surface , we can not simply dedicate all the spaces we have to roads !even now we withness traffic congestion everyday .there is an ultimate solution for that : public transportation such as metro , busses and so on .they have some outstanding advantages like low costs for both the country and personal users , and less polution of the environment .because the number of people who think of the public transportation as a solution will increase with time , the number of cars in use will even decrease !in addition to that , most of the cars are used for transportation today .in the future , with the increasing technology , we will not need to `` go  to work .instead , we will be able to do whatever we do at home with computers !for example , instead of driving to the university to attend a lesson , i will use the internet to attend the lecture online .now imagine the number of students driving to school .considering them staying at home to study makes me believe that there will not be a greater number of cars in the future .moreover , the available gasoline decreases everyday .in twenty years , the gasoline resources of world will be much less than today .although there are alternative ways to make the engine of a car start without gasoline , there might be some serious problems abouit petrol reserves in the future .to prevent the events which will probably couse a third world war , i strongly believe that the world will make regulations to own a car .therefore number of cars in use will decrease .in conclusiuon , the number of cars in use will be fewer in twenty years that in today for so many reasons .among those reasons are people s awareness of advantages of public transportation , advances in technology , and restrictive regulations to own a car because of limited amount of gasoline .
