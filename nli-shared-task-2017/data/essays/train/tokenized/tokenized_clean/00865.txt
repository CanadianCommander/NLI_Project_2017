nowadays , there are some kind of ways to learn something which have never taken before in personal .i disagree with the statement which is more effective to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .people should face to the facts what would have more important things .first of all , it is no doubt about that facts are composed by real thing .most of them have records or certifications in several ways , writing , taking photos , painting , or existing substance itself like a fossil .there are obvious no assumptions and personal opinions in the facts .besides , facts would not change the their form because they can not be made by human thoughts .for example , earth is existing on solar system , it is fact .but some people had ideas earth is just existing own , no system , in ancient world .second , ideas and concepts are based on facts .if there are no facts , ideas and concepts can not be born .people tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental , facts .in the other words , facts bring the human thoughts , ideas and concepts .in conclusion , facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that i have shown the above .there is no possibility the existense ideas and concepts without facts .
