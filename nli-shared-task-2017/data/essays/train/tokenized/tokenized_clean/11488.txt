multidisciplinary knowledge always helpful in professional and academic world .but , this is not always helpful in all the cases specifically in academics .specialization in a specific subject is very important in the context of science and technology , where the research is a major point of interest .without the specialization it is not possible to built the technological society , in which we are living now and which has been built by efforts of many scietists .hence , i disagree with statement which is focusing on broad knowledge of many academic subjects .if we consider the broad knowledge in many subjects then the student will not be informed completely about any subject .so , he had very brief knowledge in all the subjects and he will become a generalists in the context of academics .specialization in an specific subject will mould the student as a perfectionist in the subject of his interest .these perfectionists inturn can help the society in their related field .a science and technology perfectionist can do research and invent new things , which are ultimately intend tp help the society .without the specialists or the perfectionists we would not have developed the transportation vehicles such as trucks , cars etc. , communication systems on which we are depended a lot in our daily life in the present world , and the medicines or drugs which are quiet helpful in alleviating the suffereing .but , only one specialist can not produced a newthing , he takes help from many other specialists form other related fields so that he make a product in efficient manner .there are many universities in the which are offering undergraduate honors degrees , which comprises of many academic subjects to give an basic knowledge of different subjects with a major focus on a specific degree , which has been taken by the student .but , incase of graduate studies , the universities mainly offer specialization programs .the undergraduate program create an interest of subject in the mind of student so that he choose between a pool of graduate courses by showing the projects in the field of interest he had completed in undergraduate .so , ultinately the specialization is matters a lot to settle down in a competitive world .specialization plays very major role and it is highly respected in the professional world .for example , if software company got a problem with their server , then they have to call up the service who can able to solve the problem .eventhough the functions and working of server are well known by the software engineers , who are employed by the company , they are not the persons to handle and solve the problem .so , specialist the service engineer here can solve the problem .to sum i will not agree with the statement and i always support the specialists , who are quiet helpful to the socie
