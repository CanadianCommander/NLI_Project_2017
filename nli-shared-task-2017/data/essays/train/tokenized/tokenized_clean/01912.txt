since i came to the united sttes , i ve been surprised how impact the us commercials .sometimes they make me laugh and shocked .also , i ve doubted the exaggerated information .in my view , there are a lot of advertisements that does have a lot of propaganda for the following reasons .first of all , there are business competition in order to survive companies .because of a balance between demand and supply , companies have to make the catchy and striking advertisements for public .the milk that i used to drink is the good example here .i refered the milk because of containing the healthy organic gredients .however , inspectors of the government just recently found out that there had been no organic materials in the milk .there are a lot of kinds of milk , healthy one or cheaper one , local , or soy milk .most people decide what to buy by checking a package because they can not distinguishs the best one for them .as a result , the packages are the all about the materials themselves .secondly , people have changed new tendency all the time .therefore , companies need to fix in order to adjust the changed the fashion .for example , these days , people start to care about healthy food .companies pull the customers or comsumers in the companies  businesses .however , some companies can not change , so they put a fake information , such as 100 percent of nature .as you can see , there are some reasones that business convey extra information to the buyer .the goverment needs to check companies in order to protect safe and reliable advertisemants for the consumers .
