being a successful person i agree with the statement .the feeling of success is a great thing that is unresistable to have it again .when a person is successful then he/she is happy and pleasant , so the ones who tasted the success before , wants it again and again inspite of the failures or risks .the successful people are brave , they know and believe that the success is not impossible , it may be tough or risky but they know that the feeling at the end of the success worths everything .so when this person is up to a risky situation , he/she does nt hesitate to try it .risk is a way , for this person to reach the success .but of course , this person may not be always so lucky , he/she can also taste being unsuccessful , he/she can taste the unhappiness .i think this makes that person more ambitious , more hardworking .next time he/she will be more powerfull for this situation , ready for next round .doing always the same things makes us bored and it is the same for success .successful people get bored of doing the thing that they already know how to do well .it is not a new thing for them and they are nt as happy as they were at the first time they succeed it .they start to look for new or may be risky things .becuase the things that we do nt know well are risky for us .and risk is attractive for people who are looking for new successes .for example , when a successful student gets a bad mark , he/she does nt give up , works harder until he/she becomes successful and also looks for every opportunity inorder to try to be successful , this means risks .in addition to that if the successful student becomes successful again in another subject , he/she finds another subject to try to be successful .finally , i can say that successful people are unsatisfactory , ambitious and hardworking people .they love risks and new things , and never give up after failures .they do nt satisfacted by doing that they know to do well .they keep on searching for new and more success .this means being a successful person .
