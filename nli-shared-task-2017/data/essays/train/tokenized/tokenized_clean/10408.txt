advertisements is a big part of the products in the manufacturing world .many people will say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .others will say that advertisements do nt make products seem much better than they really are .personally , i agree to this statement , that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for example , during the exciting day of the super bowl .many companies fight over for a commercial spot for their product , which is usually alcohol beverages .these companies make these the most funniest , interesting , and catchy phrases for everyone to watch .eventhough they are just regular everyday alcohol products .if the prospector sees the advertisement , many people will might get convinced to buy the product because they just make it better when you watch it with everyone during the super bowl .a second example is advertisements for facial products , like make-up .many women would want to have a efficient product of make-up for their face .the advertisements have pictures and small movie clips , showing how effective their manufacture are by expressing that they are the best , than other advertisements .another example is in a personal experience when there was a modeling contest in japan .the production made advertisements that convinced people to join the contest because they offered many opportunities to the girls ; like money , magazines , and to be in a movie .these are some of the girls dreams , because of the advertisement for this contest more than 100,000 girls from the ages of tweelve to eighteen registered for this contest .advertisements are now a big part of the products , in the manufacturing world , because many people are convinced visually .consequently , these are the reasons why i support the statement that most advertisements amke products seem much better than they really are .
