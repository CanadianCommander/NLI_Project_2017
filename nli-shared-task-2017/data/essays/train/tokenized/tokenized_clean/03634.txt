i strongly agree with the idea that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars on road than there are now .first of all , as the petroleum becomes expensive because of ever increasing demand , depletion of currently easily accessible and cheaply drilled wells not to mention the increasing costs associated with finding new source of petroleum , the people will become more reluctanct to spend huge money on gas and hence might feel motivated to use car-pools or public transit systems .secondly , such huge rise in prices will also motivate government to increase investments on public transit systems such as subways and metros .investment will also be made in reserach and development of faster means of conveyance with more security features than a car can provide .if the cars on road grow on increasing at current rates , it is highly likely that so will accidents .a safer and faster way of conveyance , if developed , is bound to attract people and hence fewer number of cars on roads .another consideration is the traffic jams if the number of cars keep on increasing .the infrastructure is limited in any country and it can not match the pressure public is putting on it by bringing up new cars on road .eventually , there might be no room for infrastrcture improvments in most countries and hence one will not be able to avoid daily ritual of traffic congestion .this situation is bound to make people give a second thought on using public transit or car-pools than traveling in one car all alone .in fact , if any of the reasons i mentioned above - the price of gas , the accidents , the traffic congestion , no room to expand infrastructure - becomes very worse , the government of that country might have to regulate the production of cars or create special permits to buy cars .such regulations might seem to breach human rights in the first place , but they will do greater good to public at large in long run than harm .to conclude , the fact that natural resource such as petroleum and the possiblity of infrastructure expansion are limited , it is certain that in twenty years from now , the number of cars in use will be fewer .
