although i m a young person myself , i have to agree with the statement with a heavy heart .the lack of participation in community service among young people results mainly from lack of time .i am currently a student in a competitive high school , and the demand of schoolwork allows me very little free time .school begins at 7:40 in the morning and ends at 5:10 in the afternoon .since i live very far from the school i attend , i have to commute by train for three hours each day .when i reach home , it s almost 7:00 pm .the sun has set , the sky has darkened , the community is almost asleep , and i have tons of homework to do .there is neither time nor opportunity for me to help out in my community , regardless of how much i want to serve and contribute .most high school students in the united states have finished hundreds of hours of community service before they graduate from high school .colleges in the u.s. often consider the hours spent on community service when evaluating an applicant , emphasizing the importance of a student s willingness to serve his or her community .colleges in taiwan , however , put very little emphasis on community service when viewing applications .instead , test scores and academic accomplishments are given major consideration .students devote their time and energy to activities that colleges find more important and neglect those that are thought trivial , resulting in a lack of dedication to community service .some high schools in taiwan require their students to finish a certain amount of community service hours each year .the minimum my high school sets for us is 8 hours each semester .students use the little free time they have during summer and winter vacations to finish the required hours of community service , doing simple jobs such as sweeping up fallen leaves , volunteering at the local library or tidying up the lobby .students have no time to participate in more meaningful and long-term communty services , such as helping out each day at the local day care center , orginizing a group to reinforce the recycling habits of residents , or tutoring for free at a public middle school .from my observations and personal experiences , i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is a regrettable situation , but it is a situation that canbe improved if students are given more free time and a stronger sense of community .that way , students will be able to participate more in community service and receive a wonderful experience by spending time helping others and building a better community .
