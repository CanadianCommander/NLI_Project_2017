most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in fact , all over the world use this process .here in my native country lebanon , they show the product as a super thing and in fact , it is much less than it appears .first of all , i see wherever i go advertisements that make the products very good , and when i go to buy or see it , i find all the time that it is fake .the owner of the product always exagerates in the advertisements to attract the people .for example , i bought once a bike on the internet , the bike looked very nice and big and when they delivered it to me i found that it is a small and ugly bike .from every experience , i learn something till i found in the end that u can not trust any advertisement and u have to see the product in front of you before you buy it .furthermore , the product owners have to compete with each others , because there are a lot of factories that offer the same product .also , the advertisement for the products have to look good to attract the eye .for example , once i saw different advertisements for the same product and one of them was really good and attractive , so i decided to go to the shop that made this advertisement and buy from it .therefore the advertisement have to be good and the products should look much better than they really are to attract the buyer like they attracted me .in conclusion , the marketing for the product is very important , and the advertisement should be attractive .therefore , the products seem much better than they really are .in addition to that , the buyer have to be mature enough to differentiate between products to buy the right thing .
