in a highly competitive market , more and more companies are finding difficult to develop new ways of selling their products .one of the most effective way has been advertising in all its layouts .however , although the efficiency of advertising has been proved over the past of the years , it has also been a very controversial practise because it does not always present the products as they are in reality .that is the reason that explain why thousands of customers complain about the products they buy every year .i agree with this statement becasue i believe that the bulk of ads that surrounds us daily does not give us an accurately description and image of the product we are going to buy .this phenomenon happens frecuently at christmas .during these days , a lot of parents buy gifts for their children and they follow what they see on advertisements either on tv or in the newspapers .however , when children open their presents they are not only the ones that are dissapointed , because their parents are also surprised that the product is not as they thought in the beginning .the point here is that advertisements present products in a very attractive way and they manipulate the image in order to make it appealing for potential customers .however , what happens is that the final product is not as good as it was presented or even it has some negative aspects that were hidden in the ad .most companies outsource their advertising campaigns to others highly-specialized in advertising .these ones produce a creative campaign of advertising that introduces a new product or new aspects of an old one in our society .with this practice , companies are achieving to sell their products pretty easy and they are obtaining huge amounts of profits .this advertising trend is just focused in the short-term consequences for a company .however , in the long-term , when a company advertises its products in a different way of what they are in reality , it may be losing customers and potential customers in the future because they see that the company is not saying the truth about its products .the last consequence of this practise is that a company will lose its position in the market and then all its profitability .
