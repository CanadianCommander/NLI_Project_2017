i am completely agree with this topic .actually not most every advertisements try to control our decision about their product .i will try to explain my feelings about this statement .the companies of advertisement serve the other companies which are interesting in their products  gain .according to this they are looking for the way to sell their products more than more .actually the first way to do it improve their quality .but this way is ignored .so they use other way !tring to believe us their product is the best .of course they do it by using adverstisementsmore than this things , i want to add the most important knowledge which i have .i experienced an event happened to me two years ago .i entered in advertisement class .the proffesour displayed us some pictures and wanted to talk about them .first one is just about parfume but it told to us more than being parfume .i leaned lots of things about this advertisement .this parfume just for women who want to look beauty every time and want to control men in their life .when i heard this , i was in shock .then i contiune this class .i think it enlarged my view and developed my personality .now i can see advertisements main purpose about their products .i want to give an example .one of chocolate s popularity was very low and the company which produces it decided to get help from them .after this prosess , lots of people buy this chocolate .the advertisement tought people when they eat it they will remeber their best day in their life .consequently lots of products seem to us more than they are .so the advertisements  companies can achieve their purpose .
