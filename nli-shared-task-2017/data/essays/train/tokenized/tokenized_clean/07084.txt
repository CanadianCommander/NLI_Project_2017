i do not agree with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .even though it will be much more convenient to depend on the tour guide and follow wherever the tour guide may lead as a group , the essence of travel which sprout from experiencing the sense of adventure , as well as the sense of being an explorer while we travel can not be obtained if we had a tour guide and traveled as a group .firstly , if we travel in group led by a tour guide , we may not have to research about the place we want to travel .this is known as `` package tour  where tourists would go to the well-known tourist attractions rather than planning the trip and getting the first-hand account of exploring the unfamiliar place .this then will eliminate the core of travel .we would follow the tour guide just as a flock of sheep and we will be limited to see only what tour guide decides to take .in this sense , travelvers will not be able to travel places where they would personally like to go .this then brings up another issue of traveling as a group .if we travel as a group , we will not be able to take break or have our own time of rest .rather , we would have to follow an austere , tight schedule that is already set .of course , if we had the tight schedule , then we will probably be able to cover the area that we were told to visit , however , we will not be able to take more time on a particular place of our own interest .this means that another essence of travel , enjoyment while knowing about the place in a relaxed atmosphere , will be hindered if we traveld in a group led by a tour guide .furthermore , if the group of people that we travel with have noisy children , or if per chance people do not get along , then i think this will not be a travel that we want to cherish .therefore , i personally think group travel following a tour guide is not the best way to travel .i would rather travel with a couple of my close friends or family members where we can take time to enjoy every aspect of going on a trip starting from planning to exploring on our own to the way we like the most .
