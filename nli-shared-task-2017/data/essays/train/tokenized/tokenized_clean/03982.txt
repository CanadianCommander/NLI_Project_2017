i quite agree with the statementintrinsic meaning .i would personally support the idea that the kwoledge of concepts and ideas is extremely functional in order to better understand facts and phenomena .i would like to clarify my point , stressing the important functional relation that exist between the two cognitive processes .actually , i would get beyond , saying that undersanding concepts and ideas is essential in order to ace real phenomena .for instance , we know that many wall street investment banks sistematically hire phd students from top us school , for their researche departments in order to get a better understanding of what was going on around the economic world and for bringing into their organization the great theoretical kwoledge they have .on an overall basis , italso real that learning facts gives an important opportunity for students in order to put on to a practical dimension what they have learned from books .a clear example of this approach is provided by the harward business school teaching method .it was totally based on bringing real business cases into the class , so that the students could touch the essence of the reality , and at he same time , improving their problem solving skills .i would better suggest to see the problem in its complementar nature , saying that the two aspect are both important and students should enrich their knowledge regarding concepts and ideas but simultaneously go in depth analisying real life facts , getting a more pragmatic view .this approach is intended to be largely supported by stronger relationships between academic environment and corporations world .
