our population is evolving towards induvidualism more and more each day .what was considered proper and in the line of duty is now considered boaring and out of date .children tend to think that spending time to help others , is wasting possible time to take care of themself .by becoming more selfish we forget to help our community .young people do not see what is important in spending time with different people , they rely on themselfs for everything and think others should do the same .but our society has not changed as fast as they think .the world still needs help .for example i used to live in a small village were every decitions were made with our whole community , we would attend meetings and decide on how to resolve each problem with the young and the old .i went back to this town a few years ago and realised that children were not even attending the reunions .this shows how much they care .but on the other hand young people have less time on their sheschull to help others .with the work load we have at school and the activities we attend , it does not even leave much space for leisure .so how could we spend time helping out others when we first need to finish everything else .i spend my time between classes during the day , in the afternoon i have tenis lessons and at night i prepare my self for the tests i have the next day , when could i possibly help others ?i believe that us , the adults of tomoro are more preoccupied by are own problems then our community , and it is a shame to see this happening .but at the same time our lives are filled with work and expectations for our futur , that need to be accomplished in the first place for us to go on .
