i believe that it is not necessary that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .for me , success is an absolute term .it can not be defined by some standards like having money or a high position in job .success is what you feel it is .for some people success may be to lead a peaceful life with family and friends while sharing whatever you have .so in that terms a person may be successful by just doing whatever he knows to do well .on the other hand , those who try new things and take risks may not be successful .taking risks has both pros and cons .one may achieve a lot and at the same time there is a possibility that he may lose everything he has , while a person who does whatever he knows well is sure to keep doing that part and be content .in taking risks and trying new things , until you succeed you have the fear of losing .you put not only your happiness and well being at stake , but also of those who are dependent on you for their happiness .a person trying to do new things has to devote a lot of time researching the options , finding the best opportunity or creating one and then working on it .if he devotes the same time in doing what he already knows , he can spare some time for pleasure and fun .there are no statistics to prove that conservatives ( who do not take risks ) are less successful as compared to aggresives ( who take risks ) .risk averse and risk tolerant attitudes are also reflective of a culture or background .again , there are no reports that show that people who took risks and tried new things were the only ones to succeed .e.g. mother teresa is a successful personality .she did social work which she new well and kept doing it till the end of her life .similarly there are examples of people who gamble with the view of taking risk and trying to be successful , but lose everything .in conclusion , i would say that if for me success is to be happy and satisfied in life and i am happy and satisfied while doing whatever i know to do well , then i am a successful person .
