since cars were invented by humans , each generation gets more and more cars .my grand-parents had one car for the family , both of my parents had their own car and now i get mine .this situation underlines a lot of problems that we can discuss in this essay .i will talk about the resources such as gas or petrol , about the environement , about the public transports , about the new technologies and i will conclude with my own vision of the future .the first argument that comes to my mind when i think about vehicules is the problem of the natural resources .indeed we are more and more on this earth and we use more cars .but we do nt have unlimited resources .there will be no more petrol in less than fifty years and we will have to find a solution .the second argument is the one of the environment .cars reject a lot of carbon in the air and that s so bad for our earth that is suffering more everyday .with less cars there will be less pollution .but are we ready to stop that situation ?those two arguments are a reality and in the facts , they will contribute to say that there will be less cars in the future .but there are two arguments that i want to talk about and that could show the contrary .first , public transports are not very developped except in the big towns .for example , i live in angers and if i want to go to my school it will last 40 minutes by bus against 5 with a car .to finish , i d say that there is new techologies for the car resources such as the clean diesel that contaminates less and that consumes very less .that makes economies for everyone .to conclude , i think that there is a fatality for the car industry , with no resources there is no cars but i think that we will develop new technolgies such as oil carburant or things that could provide a cheapest and cleanest resource for ours transports .my conclusion is that there will be more and more cars in the future .
