i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because one subject is nt enough information .with all the broad knowledge of many academic subjects we are studying , it s been experimented that we only use 1 % of our brain .we should know about everything going on around us , if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future , the technologies , and we d be missing on alot .god gave as a brain for a reason .for example if you choose to concentrate on physics , you ca nt study phyics without taking algebra .you could study many academic subjects but concentrate on ur favorite subject more , this way you wont be missing on anything .imagine a world with no doctors , engineers or business .disease s would spread because their wont be any cures for them .people would live in the streets , and there wo nt be any street except a sandy dirty place .people would fight over anything they find because it does nt belong to anyone , and there s no grocery store or any shops .therefore alot of people will commite suicide , because there wont be anything to do .studying many academic subjects is nt alot , you have 12 years of studying in school that is more than enough .then you graduate and go to university , you will still study there but less hours .you would be majored in any of you re favoured topics and the rest would only help finishing you re credits and wasting time so you would nt get bored .me myself i m a very lazy person and i would preffer if we do nt study academic subjects , but if you think about it for a few seconds and imagine how you re life would be you will imaditely change you mind , because there wo nt be anything to complain on and life would be useless .
