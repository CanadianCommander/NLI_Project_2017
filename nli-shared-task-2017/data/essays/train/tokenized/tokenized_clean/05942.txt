i agree to the statement `` most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are  .in an advertisement such as commercials on tv s and ad s in magazines , it seem like it is a very attrative product and trying to get people s attention by their first look .the company will use backgroung and surroundings , unreal features and famous people to apeal their products .when i was a little , i used to see commercials advertisement of barbie dolls all the time .the commericials showed how you could do so many thing with the dolls and how much fun you can have with them .there were music on the background and a perfect set that the girls played in .i was absolutley attracted by the commerical and always asked for a new barbie doll .but when i baught them , it might not move the way it moved in the tv and some of the features showed in the commercial did not come with the product .another way they are making the product look better , is by using special features .for example , i once saw as tv show that showed how they created commercials for food products .usually they will not show the real food .there are proffesionals who make food from clays and plastics to show more texture and better in looks .they will use sprays to show coldness of drinks and steams to show how hot they are .they can also create their commercial using computer graphics so that it can look better .the usage of celebrities has an influence on the viewer also .even if the product is not as good as it looks , when it is held or presented by a famous celebrity , you might think that the product is attractive be convined in buying the product .in an commercial or an advertisement , they will use the background , special features that is unreal , and celebrities to make the product to be apealing .from these reasons i belive that most of the advertisement are making the pruducts look more attractive than it really is .
