having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject are , in my point of view , both very important .but there is a time for the two and i think that it s better to first concentrate on learning many different things when we can do it .i mean during our studies .first , when we know about many academic subjects , we can talk with lots of different kinds of people .for instance , in my school , which is an engineer school , there are different departments such as biology , civil engineering , informatic . ..before this school i made two years of `` preparating class  , in which i learned about different academic subjects .what is interesting is that i can now talk with my friend who are in different departments without shame because i can understand a minimum of what they say and discuss it .second , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can help us to know what we want to do after and then chose the best specialization for us .during my two years of `` preparing class  , i learned about physic , maths , mecanics , biology , chemics . ..it helped me to chose my department and not to make a mistake and having to change my education later .more of that , all that i learned during this two years help me in my education of biology engineer and in my everyday life .i m proud when i can answer to basic question about physic that , for example , my parents ask to me and i enjoy reading easily scientific magazines about different kinds of subjects .to conclude , i will say that the specialization must be acquire only when it is necessary .we can specialize after , in our job , but it s more difficult then to learn about many academic subjects because we do nt have the time and we have more difficulties to learn than when we are a student .
