taking risks could be good for some people , and could be the worst thing that they do for some people .it relies on faith .taking risks may be good for some pepole because many people thinks that where there is a risk there are a lot of opportunity .these people love to take a risk , and like to challenge with these risky things .also if you get lucky when you take risks you will open a new door for yourself , and you may be successful , and feel happy .however , if you try somthing new , and you could not success you will feel mope , and everything in your life will distroyed .in addition , when you take risk you will be stressed .so keep away from taking risks , and do not try to do new thing that you do not know ho to do it .on the other hand , doing what you already know how to do well is better than take a risk in life becuase when you take a risk you may lose every thing that you take a risk for .furthermore when you take a risk you may not success , and turn your previous successful to nothing , so people will forget your successful .but you do what you know how to do well you will success , and feel happy .so keep doing what you doing is better than take risks for reasons that you dot know if it will success or not .in conclustion , it depends on lucky , and nobody want to fauil .i think the effect of unsuccsseful is something that nobody can load .and becuase of these reasons i do not agree with the statement that say `` successful people try new things , and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .
