i think advertisements are soul of commerce .no one can sells his products without advertisements .i agree with the statement because i have found a lot of product that seemed much better than they really was .i think the reason that could take a seller to use that kind of advertisements is that people are really impressonable .if they see an advertisement that promise them a lot , they certainly think that the product that advertisement represent is better than another one which promise them less .nowadays i can say that a very large number of sellers use this kind of advertisements .the first example i can talk about is diet products .in the television we can see a lot of advertisements saying that using that product we could lose a lot of kylos in few weeks or days .we immediately can understand that this it is an advertisement that makes the product seems better than it really is .we all know that there is nt any product that permits you to lose ten or twenty kilos in two weeks , and if it exists , it will be really dangerous .i can talk about this product also because my mother tried a lot of this products , and no one of them has given the results she wanted .another example i can use is banks or financial group which lend you money .in their advertisements it seems like that you can use their money and to gave it back is really easy .but there are a lot of clauses , generally writed small and in the end of the contract , that explain what you have to do to give their money back .generally here you can read about really high tax of interest and other problems you will have to confront later , and that give you more troubles .the last example is shampoos .in the tv advertisements sellers promise you that their product will make your hairs bright , strength , difficult to break and many other promise that generally are nt true .i tried a lot of shampoos which have no one of the characteristics i have said before .in conclusion i can say that advertisements generally make product seem much better than they really are .
