of course yes , this is a really important part of graphic design , making the products look better than theyre really are , its almost the same with a model on the cover of a magazine , she doesnt look with something strange on his face , she will be always looking in a good shape , with a perfect teeth , perfect skin , perfect hair its all about fashion and image to make your product sell .the perfect example are the mcdonalds advertises , you always see a big burguer , looking so tasty and delicious , but theyre not , thats why all the people go to mcdonalds and get the bigmac that they saw on tv , expecting the biggest burguer ever and tehy just receive a small burguer like everyone else .i think that the cars are the only thing that look exactly like they look on tv , they cant show you something and offering another .at this moments , everything turns around graphic design , all those advertises on the streets , on the tv , on the magazines , all to make the poeple buying your product because this is the goal that everybody who starts a business wants .another example could be the action figures that they look so great on tv with all those enemies all those weapons and all that battle fields , and when you get your own you just get the character and you need to get the other items by separated .i bet those companies sells a lot of toys every christmas , getting first a huge campaign for the tv and making the kids crying to they moms to make her buying toys every year .this is wha really happen with all of those products , everything its invloved , food , clothing , toys , care products , cars , unfortunately we are going to still living in a world full of consumism .
