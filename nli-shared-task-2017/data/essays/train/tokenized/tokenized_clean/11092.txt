this is a very extended statement , especially among old people .i believe , it is totally unfair to judge young people according to what it is done by a residual part of them .i have been working with inmigrants for more than two years .most of them coming from east europe with any spanish knowledge .our task is not only teaching the language but also offer them a pleasant face in an strange country .it is revealing how many people work in my ngo .we are more than 250 individuals ! .on top of that , according to a public survey conducted by an impartial valencian agency , 2 out of 5 people under 28 are enrolled in any type of ngo .i prefer to see the glass have full than half empty .of course , i noticed there are more people that do not collaborate with their community that those that do it .despite that fact , in absolute terms , there are more than 150.000 members in the city of valencia , that devote their time to handicapped people .i find this figure to be undoubtely compelling .a recurrent excuse provided for those who do not collaborate relates to the lack of time to undertake such social tasks .i agree .social works require a personal effort , but on the other hand it is all about organising yourself .i am proud to say that i can do all the things i did prior to my engagement with the ngo .it depends on how efficiently you plan your spare time .in conclusion , i disagree with the statement provided .there are milions of young people around the world who deliver assistance to the other for free and those figures are increasing .therefore i do not share the pessimistic view of the statement and what it is more , i invite everyone to collaborate in the way they can since what you will receive is much bigger than what you will give .
