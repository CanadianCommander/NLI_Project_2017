one specific subject could be more difficult to developing your ideas .i agree that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .you can learn more things for giving opinions about them .also its important for having well grade in the university .on the other hand you can give different lectures with many academic subjects to your students .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can learn more things for giving opinions about them .it gives you an extra point in group of academic for talking about different subjects .also you cant show yourself more success to your head of department .that will gives a point for getting a position at a department easly from the others .forexample ; i am an interior architect but also i study for industrial desing that gives me more department in my university .means that having more value from the others for university position .other view ; its important for having well grade in the university .it means that you can take more class about your interest moreover ; give a chance meeting more than ten prosfessor to taking their ideas from your topic .it to difficult in my coutry to talking any prosfessor if you dont take his or her class .they dont have much time .having more grades is also important for going in another step like ; doctoral degree .you can manege your part with your grades in my country .you can give different lectures with many academic subjects your students .i have an example for it ; my history lecturer burcu ozguven , she is giving history lecture and studies many subjects like decoratives in interior architecture , gardening , textures for early period of the greeks .she can give lectures each of the subjects .its grade for a person i think .having more opinions are important for our life .if we have time we must develope our subjects for being well educated .people could use this education for serving to people .im a lecturer and have to be learn more for my students .
