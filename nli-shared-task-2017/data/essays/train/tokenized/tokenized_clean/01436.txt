man have travelled for as long as he has lived in society .the characteristic of most of today s travelling is that it is motivated not by economic or political necessity , but by pleasure .leisure and this search for pleasure is at the root of the tourism industry .understanding the sources of this pleasure provides a solid base to comprehend the best ways to travel .where is a person s pleasure in travelling rooted ?i believe in curiosity : in being exposed to new situations , enjoying beautiful scenery , getting to know different ways of living , and being a part of other customs and cultures .it is important to note that the satisfaction of this curiosity is greater when it emerges from personal discoveries .the best way to travel is , hence , the one which favors and maximizes the satisfaction of curiosity in these two dimensions .travelling can be led by a tour guide , or simply alone - in group or individually .in order to decide which is best , one must ponder the new things one would like to see and learn , on one part , and the possibility of discovering these individually , on the other .unfortunately , frequently these do not imply each other , meaning that waiting to discover the marvels of the places a person travels to generally takes time and energy , limiting the places and important things one visits and sees .the choice of travelling with a guide permits maximizing the experiences , knowledge and sightseeing , but generally minimizes the possibility of discovering these individually .considering these , i prefer travelling with a tour book that introduces me on the most important sightseeing and culture enrichening experiences , but does not hinder the possibilities of running off track for some time and discover new things personally .this is the way i travelled central america last summer , and it was certainly a gratifying experience .i have also travelled led by a tour guide - to cuzco and macchu picchu , peru - and although it was a great experience , being able to discover things by yourself as you travel is truly rewarding .i have also travelled alone , to bolivia , but at many times i felt i did not know where to go .travelling with a book , instead of a tour guide - in group or individually - seems to maximize the often antithetic sources of pleasure in travel : exposure to new surprising experiences and scenery and the satisfaction of personal discoveries .
