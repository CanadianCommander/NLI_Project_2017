i m convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specializing in just one specific subject .there are several reasons why i agree with this previous statement .first of all , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allow us having a personal culture .the school give to the students the capacity of studing a substantial number of subjects , so it s important having a knowledge of them for ourself , as a culture for being well prepared in general .because i think that knowing differents subjects open more our mind than just focus in one specific subject .in fact knowing just a specific subject is like a limitation .second , the knolwedge of many academic subjects give the chance to have more chance in our life .indeed , knowing a vast amount of informations show your potential with other people .you are prepared and have what it takes to be considered as an efficient person .occasions in life can occur , because you are prepared in many subject so in a future you could do several works .to sum up , i think that many reasons exist why knowing many object is better than just one
