i do think that there will be few cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because we do not have enough resources as petrolem and our environment can not stand for the pollution for another twenty years .although car is convenient , it is not a good vehicle of transportation because we have already pay much price on it .the most significant reason i think that the use rates of cars will reduce in twenty years is we will lack of the resources pretty soon .since car has been invented and the industrial revolution , the natural resources of petrolem become needed than ever .however , it takes time for petrolem to be mature but we ignore this fact for a long period because we can not not live without it .nowadays , almost every family has at least one car and the demand of the industry cause the petrolem reduce faster than it can grown .this kind of natural resources can hardly be fixed and last forever once it has been used out .the car amount will decay because it is not easy to find a replacable resource to cover and our environment can not take the side effect that came along with the pollution .bscause of the humenbeings , earth has suffered for a long time because of the pollution .in brief , our main concerned now is to reduce the amount of cars .if we do not take it seriously , the disaster came with the industry activities will rullin every creature that live on the world .air pollution , water pollution and all these kind of issues should be protected immediately .i think the amount of cars will be fewer in use in twenty years than there are today .the two major reasons that make it occur is the lack of natural resources and the pollutions .we need to take action as soon as possible not only because we do not have energy to drive our car but because we do not want to drive the car .this is a kind of action that protect the environment in a most effective way .
