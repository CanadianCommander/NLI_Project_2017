i disagree with this statement , although i was thinking the same way when i was a teenager .when i was about sixteen , i regarded my grandmother sitting in her little kitchen and thought that she was not admireable because of her old age and health problems .in my opinion in these times , only young people were able to have fun , because they got the body fitness which allowed them to swim in lakes , ride a bike and dance during the whole night at a party .but today , i oppose this opinion very harshly .now i know , that every step in the human life has its advantages .when you are young , without doubt the ability in enjoying life is based on sports and fun , as i just mentioned .you do not care about any sorrows or any severe plans for future .so this seems to be the only time in life , where you are able to live without fear .but when you grow older , you are able to regard problems in life from a more abstract or distinct point of view , you are wiser and able to differ between severe and unimportant problems .when i talk to my grandmother today , i learn that the joy in her life is linked to the joy of her famliy , especially with her children she raised .instead of taking care of her children , she now is able to see her efforts and has more time for herself .now she travelles to her sister several times a year , which she could not afford in times when she was raising her children .it is true that the responsibility for ones actions grows parallel to the growing of the age , but also the joy in taking this responsibility grows .as an adult one is able to deal with responsibility , which offers lots of new challenges .these challenges not only are important milestones in development , but they can also be a huge joy .for example , to found a family , marry a wife and raising children with her , without doubt is a huge responsibility , but it can also be the greatest fun in ones life .to draw a conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do , the only enjoy life in a different way .
