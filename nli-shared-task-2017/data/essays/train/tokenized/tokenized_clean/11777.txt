i totally agree with the statement that sucessful people are willing to try new things and take risks rather than just doing what they know and do things which they do well .i will elaborate & exemplify my reasons for doing so .people who are willing to try new things shows that they have a sucess attitiude .this is the most important factor for any one to succeed .afterall it shows the desire & willingness to try new things which have not been tried before .recently i read a story about a buisnessman who went on a holiday to indonesia , where he got an opportunity to learn about the working of a steel mill .just by his new ways of doing things he bought that steel plant & today owns more than 25 % of total steel production in the worldsucess attitude comes to those who have the knowledge about why should they try new things .if someone does not have the knowledge he will not be able to try new things .taking the same example , why was the buisnessman i mentioned above , could take over the indonesian mill .this is for the simple reason , that he had the knowledge from back home , about waht works & what does nt as his father had a small steel plant .lastly peope who are willing to take the risk , by trying out new things exhibit leadership .it is only this leadership quality which generates that desire to know more , to do more & to achieve more .today the buisnessman i mentioned above is respected as the world leader in steel industry , because he took initiative .on the other hand people who only do things which they know to do well are are indirectly indicating , they are happy in what they are doing .in my opinion it is as attitude which may not lead to sucess in the long run .hence i believe that the world belongs to those who are willing to try & willing to do new things .this is my philosphy of sucess .
