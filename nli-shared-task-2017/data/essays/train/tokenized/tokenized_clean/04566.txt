living in a time where technologic novelities flood society in rapidly successing waves it seems a little bold to make asumptions about the transportation situation in the next twenty years .but , nethertheless , i have the courage to say that i do not believe that there will be fewer cars in use by then .one might argue that the global energy supply will diminish , that the market for new cars might be saturated some time ( perhaps in the industrial nations . .. )that alternatives like buses and the train system will improve further in quality and quantity , and that humans will finally , finally concede that using public transport will help save the environment .but looking at the situation with a global perspective , the world s most populated regions like india , china , southeast asia have nt even nearly cought up to western standards in individual transportation .in twenty years , around the globe the demand for this individual transport facilities will have skyrocketed .if one still will speak of cars , no-one knows .a brief look at the telecommunications sector will suffice to see how rapidly technology can evolve .furthermore , old cars ca nt be desposed of as easily as old telephones or computers .so , as could be examplified with cuba where u.s. cars from the 50ies still crowd the streets of la habana , the new cars of today will probably find their new homes in the poorer regions of earth .in total , i can not really relate to the idea that the total number of cars circulating on our planet will have diminished in 20 years .to achieve a reduction in emission of carbondioxide and other waste produced by combustion of fossils it would certainly be helpful to limit the amount of cars .but as far as i can see , besides of the - usually powerless - environmental activist found in each society , there s no strong lobby to be found which could enforce a reduction in car volume .and by the way , what happened to the newest porsche or the most sophisticated mercedes benz ?would anyone really want to have them vanished ?
