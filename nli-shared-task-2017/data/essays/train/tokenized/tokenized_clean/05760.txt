i agree with this statement , students must more understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .one moment can amphasize my agreement , evry time teatchers are asqued their students if they understand and if they having questions .question like this was asked and will be asked by teachers to know if students understand leaning material .by understandng ideas and concepts students can use these knowledge more productively .it s give possibility to apply ideas and concepts in another domain .only if the students understand ideas an concepts , they will be able keep them for a long time in their life and transmit them so clairly .for example seriouly undestanding basis of physic may be applyed to build roads in thery bad geological conditions .we know that knowledge of physic permit mankind to fly to cosmos .contrariwise , leaning facts can help some times but no so effectivly like understanding ideas an concepts .here , it difficult to use learning facts .because here information seems superficially to be applyed in a given domain .therefore , the very important attention may be done in the understandind of ideas and concepts than in learning facts .it must be a credo of teatching .and this approch will be transmitted from generation to generation of teatchers .only like that thde teaching will stay an art .
