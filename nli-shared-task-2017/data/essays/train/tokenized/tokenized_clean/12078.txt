based on my experience , i do not agree with the statement , though i understand the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for using academic skills properly .in particular , technology without ethics is dangerous such as genetic engineering and nuclear power without deep consideration of their effect on our society .once we specialize in one specific subject , we tend to be narrow minded and do not care about other things happening in the world .in that sence , i agree with the idea that having broad academic knowledge is important .however , if academic skills are required for becoming professional in any areas , to know deeply in one subject is much more important than to know broadly in many subjects .if i make an advise for high school student who enter a university for academic skills , i would say `` it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects if you want to be a professional .to know something is totally different from to do with something , in general .for example , skills to do research as a professional in one specific subject is very much different the skills to know many subjects as a hobby .when we are young , we tend to try to broaden our possibility and be interested in many areas .based on my experience , however , our time is limited and too short to know many academic knowledges deeply .we have to choose either way of knowing deeply or knowing broadly .they are trade off .therefore , after getting enough knowledge of one specific subject as a professional , having a broad knowledge of other academic subjects is the best way , i think .once we are used to one academic subject , it is much easier to know other academic subjects , because the structures of academic subjects are similar , in general .to summarize , if we would like to do with the academic skills as a professional , i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject for several years in a university .
