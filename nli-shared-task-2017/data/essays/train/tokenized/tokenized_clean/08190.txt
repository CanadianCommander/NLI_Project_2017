something about everything and everything about something .that is my moto in life .one can not either deciede to take any one of the above , that simply wont be enough .as normal functioning humans in this day and age of information explosion , we can not choose to be ignorant about anything .also indepth knowledge about some particular subject is also very important for our own professional success .as far as academic subjects are concerned , the key word here would be time .when a person is in school , his subject study should be as broad as possible .he should learn literature , science , arts , maths and everything else which canbe covered in his curicullum .school is the time when the brain is developing and the mind is growing .the child in this time should get the widest exposure possible .one in graduate college , the course he chooses should be more specific but also include subjects covering wider toipcs .a medical sciences students should be taught about digital circuitry too as should psychology be included in a course on engineering .the student must have an option of branching out or even experimenting .also having related knowledge only helps in understand how varied information canbe utilized to help in what would seem to be unrelated subjects .then further on with post-graduate and research based study the students can aquire more specialized knowledge about the subjects of their interest .but as i stated earlier , the whole question about broad knowledge or specialized knowledge would depend upon the fact that when is the question being asked .in relation to a school student , broad subject study is essential and otherwise he would just be isolated from the many different things he could learn and become .in relation to agraduate student , the coursework needs to have a direction of flow but the coverage of topics should be wide as it shall allow experiment and improvisation .then as post-graduate and then doctorial specializations come up the nature of knowledge should narrow down drastically .but as far as life is concerned , a combination of the two will be elementary to success .moreover with increasing pressures on democracy , overpowering multinationals and a growing global marketplace , inormation and knowledge might just save the day .
