i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i have two reasons to support my opinion .first of all , i believe an understanding of a concept will lead to further understandings .for instance , without the primary understading of how muslim is practiced and worshipped , one will not be able to fully understand why a certain ritual exists in that religion .by understanding ideas of a fact , one will also be able to develop his or her ability to think , and to interconnect different aspects of numerous information on various topics .an example will be understading the concept of darwin s evolution theory .through this understanding , a student will not only learn a new biological fact , but he or she will also be able to connect this information in a history class when a discussion on the industrial revolution ( the time period when the theory was first introduced ) .the student will learn that the revolution had allowed quick spread of the scientsit s idea than before .with the combination of the biological and historical aspects of darwin s theory , the student will be able to recognize the difficulty the scientist faced when he had informed the society his new idea , and had received many criticisms about it .secondly , i am against simply learning facts , because i seek no point in merely memorizing a piece of information .even is one was able to answer a question correctly , if the person was unable to explain the reasons for the answers , not much credit can be given .let s say a man knew that mixing an imputiry in water will lower its melting point .even if he did know that fact , if he did not know how this could help him in a real life situation , how much would this knowledge mean to him ?what would be the point in knowing such thing ?on the other hand , if the man had the understanding that an impurity lowers water s melting point , his understanding will allow him more thinking , integrating this fact to the other knowlegde the man possesses .the man will incorporate his knowledge that salt is an impurity , that snow is also a form of water , and that the ground becomes slippery when snow melts .as a result , he knows that he can pour salt over snow to prevent it from melting quickly , preventing people to slip .with these reasons , i belive it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn just the facts
