i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .life enjoying has nothing to do with age .it does not depend on the activities a person does , but on the feelings he has .it is true that young people have more chances to experience different activities and to meet different people .they are usually more open to learn from other people and to perform new activities .young people can meet new people at school , at work or at the clubs and bars .they are also physically able to do sports , to travel to ` unsafe  places , and to go to long-lasting parties .this kind of activities can be good sources of joy and happiness .but older people do not have to experience different activities or to meet different people to enjoy life .as well as they get older , they identify what kind of activities provide them the most joy .they also learn who are their true friends .older people stop worrying about everyday problems and start understanding the things that matter .they have more time to spend with the family : they can enjoy their children and greatchildren more than they did while young .they have more time to travel ( to ` safe  places ) and to see their true friends .i believe that the secret for life enjoying is to understand every age and not to try to take back time .people who understand every moment as a unique opportunity to be happy can enjoy life when they are old as well as they did when they were younger .and it is not a theoretical belief : i know old people who have enjoyed life only by understanding every moment .my grandfather is a good example : he is 80 years old .everytime i see him he is smiling , everytime he remembers the past he smiles , and everytime he thinks about the future he smiles .i want to live my life that way : i want to take the best of time with friends , with my family , at work and at the university in order to enjoy every second .
