this is an intricate subject for me , yet i will try to elucidate it .many students think that if there is a more free and intellectual environment in the universities , they can be more successful and creative .on the other hand , other students claim that there is no need much more intellectual level education , if univesity can provide enough knowledge for surviving life , it s ok .in this context , i support the former idea for the following reasons .one of the strongest reasons in favor the approach undestanding ideas and concepts more important for students is that the economic and social system have been transforming to more elligible form for the knowledge society .as a result of this , if you have not catched the changing , your knowledge based on facts will be old in short time .another reason is that there was not much more crucial focusing on research and development studies and innovation in the agricultural and industrial societies .however , reasearch and development and innovation are the major determiners of global economy , so they are feeding new ideas and concepts .if you are inside the novelty , you can have changing the world .that s why , we must locate on the side of new ideas an concepts .lastly , production centers have been shifting from industrial zones to science and technoparks .economical system has been gradually adapting the science and technology .the major supporters of science and technology are new ideas and concepts .for this reason , so many venture capital firms emerged .what does it provide us ?if we have a original , creative and useful idea , we are able to be successful in the less time .all things considered , i come to notion that there are three reasons why i support the idea undestanding ideas and concepts more important than learning facts .firstly , we have lived in the knowledge society , so we must have the knowledge for our whealty .secondly , new economy has based on new ideas and concepts .thirdly , the new economical structure can provide new opportunuties if we have creative ideas and concepts .
