i agree that successful people try new thing and take more risks than doing the thing which is already known there are several examples in various facets of our life .let us discuss a few of them in political , science and technology and adventurism .mahatma gandhi , has fought for freedom and got the independance .at his time it was completely unthinkable , how one can use non violence as a method of struggle and fight for freedom .had he not tried the new thing and taken the risk , one can not imagine what could have been the consequences .many adventurers has explored the continents and oceans and found many places and people .with out the temperment and character to try to do things differently and with out taking risks it would not be possible .at the science and technology front there were millions of examples .as one of our professor says , to be successful one need not do different things but do the same thing differently .the same thing has been implemented by many scientists and we are enjoying their inventions .to name few the invention of bulb , telephone , electronic computer , automobiles , aeroplanes and medicines .the way we are sending space shuttles and unmanned missions to mars and saturn is a telling example of how different the scientist think .the drug discovery also has seen some radical thinking .unless one try to do things off beat , it is not always possible to get interesting and useful results .every aspect of our life we can find such example .unless one has new way of thinking and ability to take risks , he / she can not be successful .if every one does the same way and think the same way we shall be getting the same kind of results and probably we can not be called human beings but robots .successful people try new thing and take risks , converse is also true as per the above mentioned examples .but one shall not get carred away and say that doing unconventional and risky things is the only way to be successful .as again one of my professor puts humorosly , ` all the research is crazy thinking but not all the crazy thinking is not research  .to conclude one shall think differently , do things which were not tried before and take calculated risks to be successful .
