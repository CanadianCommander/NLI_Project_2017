i agree with the the statement , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities and are too busy spending time on other things .the young people of today claim to be very busy and not to have time for idle pastimes .how much of this is really true ?cant a youngster fit in about two hours a week into his busy schedule dedicated to community service ?too many questions with not enough answers .young people of today do lead more compititive lives .compitition today is much more than what it was 10 years back .with increased compititition , the student has to put in greater amount of work just to get noticed .however , what youngsters fail to realise is that more leverage is been given nowadays to people who serve the community .as an example , a company that had come to recruit students from my college had given preferance to those that had done some amount of commuinty work as compared to those that havent .moreover , i feel that , the main time spent by a youngster today is in watching movies , spending time with his or her friends or surfing the internet .the advent of the internet has caused people to become more insulated from one another .people claim that they are very active on the net .some go to the extent that they use the net for `` social  causes such as creating a blog after a disaster , such as a flood , war or earthquake .the same youngster goes on to feel very proud of himself .at some point of time , the young person needs to understand that a blog only helps in voicing opinions but dosent help solving problems .thirdly , i feel the one major thing absent in all youngsters today is a concience that tells them to do good for others .youngsters seem to have become a selfish lot by caring only about themselves and their comfort .they seem to lack the enthusiasm to go the extra mile to help other people .i feel , this is due to a lack of awareness .hence , at some time in the school level , all students must be made to do something good for their class or for their friends so that they realise how good it feels to help others .in conclusion , a young person must give more time to helping the community since , if every young person could do just that , the world would become a better place to live in .
