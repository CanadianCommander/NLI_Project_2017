in the following , i will write an essay about the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .if we have a look at some companies , it becomes clear that this statement fits very well .for example : the first mcdonalds was very successful until today , where mcdonalds is a popular name all over the world .they have been very successful and took risks by opening further restaurants .now this company opened a new store called mccafe , where they sell various types of coffee , cake and ice .they tried new things and become also successful with their idea .there are also companies they must try new things because of the economic competition in the world .they have to invent new things to attract the consumer with innovative products .i think this statement fits with my opinion .successful people completed a quiet difficult task and are also proud of being successful .if i were successful that i do nt need to care about money , i would definitely try new things and take risks .in my opinion , life would be quiet boring if i only did what i know how to do well .on the other hand i will not take much as much risk that i will lose everything and have to start from the beginning .
