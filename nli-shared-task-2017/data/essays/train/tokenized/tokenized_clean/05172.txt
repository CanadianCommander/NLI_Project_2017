i do not agree with the statement that says that fewer cars will be used in the future , twenty years later .i would like to exlain three reasons why i think that there will be still cars , using for many purposes , as the same as those of todays .as the first reason , i would like to point out the advent of new technology .it has been criticized that using cars are not good for environment due to their emission of gas .their gas destroy the ozon layer , thus people argue that these gas should be reduced .as the solusion , for instance , many countries sing up in the international agreement , kyoto convention , to reduce the emmision of co2 .for one of the efforts , some companies try to invent new type of gas , which is less harmuful for environment .if the new type of gas will be used in future cars , their detrimental effects on environment will be reduced .thus , people s concerns about car s effects on environment could be reduced .in that case , cars could be used more in the future .for the second reason , i would like to refer to the aging society .within several years , japan and some ec countries will face to the serious problems according to the increase of aging population .for elders , paticuraly living alone , it is difficult to go out by theirselves .they sometimes need the support by others .however , the use of cars for elders may support their independent lives .for instance , my grandfather often uses a car to go shopping .by using a car , he need not to bring heavy bags when he buys many things in the supermarket .although he lives alone now , he can go out by himself by using a car .therefore , for elders in the aging society , the use of cars enable their lives more convinient with less support by others .in counclusion , according to these three reasons , i think that there will be more cars after twenty years .if the harmuful effects of cars on environment could be reduced , i think that we need not hesitate to use such efficient instruments for improving our life more and more .the balance between nature and technology can be taken accrding to the advent of new gas .moreover , in the aging society , elders could be more active and independent to use cars .
