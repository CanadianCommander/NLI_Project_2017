young people enjoy life more than older people ?i think this is a really hard question .both sides have their own benefits .the roles in life are kind of inverted .when you have the health to enjoy life , you dont have money , have to work , and cant enjoy it .then , when you are old , you have the time and money , and because of your health , you cant enjoy it as much is if you were younger .i dont agree in part with the proposed statement .when you are young , you have little problems and consequently live without stress , enjoying .once you start growing the problems get more serious and you start to feel the stress .i like very much to be young and am now detrmined with the things i am pursuing .i am not going to tell you that i enjoy working as doing sports , but i enjoy my work too .if i could choose , i wouldnt change my position .life is about stages and i try to enjoy each of them .older people enjoy life in a different way .their knowledge and position allow them to enjoy specific situations ; obviously depending of the stage in which they are .they could have had retired and be travelling aound the world , they could have had their first nephew , they can enjoy reading about their real interests , they can spent some time in their beach house , they can play some tennis , they can develop their entreprneurship interests , etc .summaryzing , they have more experience and are in total control of their lifes .if they have a stable economic situation , they can do whatever they want and really enjoy life .
