i totally agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .many various examples can illustrate the exactitude of this statement .first , the evolution of the medecine and of the new discovered remedies is perhaps the best example ever of this statement .over time , scientifists have made very important discoveries .as a result , people can live longer and healthier than before .even though we have not found yet any remedy for aids , we have already made a lot of progress in the treatment of this horrible disease .another very illustrative example of this idea is the example of the chef in a very famous restaurant .if he want to keep his reputation and his clients , he will have to try again and again new recepies .he can not keep the same menu for years and years .therefore , he has to innovate and try new tastes , new combinations of aliments .this implies also to take some risks .indeed , the chef is never sure that the clients will love the new kind of food he has cooked .finally , the evolution of the plane is also very illustrative of this statement .years ago , people would not have imagine being able to fly one day .however , thanks to some brave pilots , we can now flight from one continent to another in a very short time .this amazing improvement in transportation would not have been possible without ambitious pilots and engineers .in conclusion , i really believe that we have to try new things and take risks if we want to be successful .therefore , i want to find a creative job that allows me to try new experiments and to take risks .i am conviced that it is the best attitude to adopt if we want to improve our way of life .
