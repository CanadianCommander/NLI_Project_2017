we can see many successful people is word such as bill ghates and einstine .bill ghates made a lot of money form creating a software called windows and einstine made a great theory such as e = mc2 .even the way they succes is different the common thing is that they gave there entire life to built it .in my opinion successful people doesn ; t try new thing but try to develope the thing they can do well .bill ghates met his first computer when he was 14 years old .at that time there was two famous company called macantoshi & apple ( well later they united though ) .he tried to learn computer because if was very interesting .later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself .this kind of result was able because he constantly developed his talent .in my opinion for succesing finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important .einstine is also a succesful persone is physics .his new theory about black energy , black holes , times , lights and movement destroied newton and platon s theory and made a new page is the history of physics .it is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man .in my opinion that the reasone it was able is because he always thaught about physics .many books and researches says that he thaught about physics 60 percent of his time .as you can see successful people developes there talents rather than finding a new way .to conclude i think that successful people find there talent and develope what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do .it is because no pains no gains .not trying any thing and seeking for chances to succeed can never make a good result .
