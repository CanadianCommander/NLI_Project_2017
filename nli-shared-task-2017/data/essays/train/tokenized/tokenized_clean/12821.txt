advertisements are one of the most power means of communication in modern society , people hardly ignore their existant .undoubtedly , nowadays , advertisements are everywhere , people could nt live without them .there are on the tv , in the radio , on the top of the building , event being printed on the subways and buses .most of advertisements combine with words and illustations , these sentences and colorful pictures strongly draw people s attention .i take myself as an example , i was always being attracted by the huge billbroad hung on the time square , and i felt these pictures are so delicate , elegant and beautiful .nevertheless , have you ever think about that are they too good to be true .are these modles on the billbroad really as perfect as princes and princesses in the child s book .i mean they have no pimples or extra hairs at all on their faces .something must be done for this advertisement i suspect .after i went to graphic design school to obtain the knowledge about photoshop , i understood that actually these perfect faces had gone through special repairs , the advertisers or graphic designers applies photoshop to make the model s faces look fawless .in this way , advertisements will attract comsumers to purchase more products , and make more profits for merchants .however , it brought about many disadvantages .some products in the advertisements look too good to be true , actually , in some extent , the companies or merchants misled the comsumers .for instance , one day , i went to lunch at wendy s , i was attracted by an advertisement that a huge hambager with a big pack of french fries only charge me $ 3 .then i bought it without a hesitation .when i recieved the food from the attentant , i was competely shocked .the food is not good enough than i expected before .from that day , i did nt trust food advertisement at all , i thouhght they are all fake , the food is not as food as they discribe
