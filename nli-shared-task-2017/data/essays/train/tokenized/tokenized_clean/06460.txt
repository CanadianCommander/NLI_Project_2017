i agree with the statement about having broad knowledge of many different subjects is better than only one specific subject .nowadays , there are too much knowledge to learn .everyday we can get new information from the internet , books , newspapers , and tvs .first , i think every subject is important to us .some people thinks that only high-technology is the most important thing of our society .because of the great improve of technology we have a convient live .but it does nt mean other subjects worth nothing .good society needs good policy and it relates to many many different subjects like economy , history and so on .second , since we can get so much information everyday , we should tell which is right and which is wrong , which is trouth and which is fake .in order for us to tell from right to wrong we should have some basic knowledge .we should have broad basic knowledge of different kinds of field .third , even when talking about high-tech we should learn knowledge from many different kinds of field and combine it together .only if we combine different kinds of knowledge can we turn our technique into application .many new industry combine two or even more fields .bio and electronics , bio and mems , bio and nanotechnology are all the new trend in the future .when people have only one specific subject of knowledge , when talking about some specific thing , they might be an expert .on
