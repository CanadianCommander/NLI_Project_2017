i agree that successful people try new tthings and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .one thing is good about successful people they already know how to do what they know and succeed with it .now , they need to move on to another level and have more experience .they want also to to come with new project wich can make them more successful .successful people should come with more project , make more reseach for their knowledge because the more they know is the more they succeed and it will worth for them too .it is important for people who a large opportunities to what they know to attract the popularity of success .in the other hand , people with creativity is a benefit for the world because they always come with new project and they can handle the future easily .therefore people every body in the wold can count on them , such as the government , health care provider , section of cultural , section of education and commercial .wich can make their work easily by comming with new project .successful people who try new things and take risks wil be more success ful than other people who affraid to take the risks and try new things ; because they will limited to what they could learn and they could help .unfortunately , they wo nt helpfull for people who will need them , and the future will limited also for them and others .the world will reject them and it will bee waste of time for them .
