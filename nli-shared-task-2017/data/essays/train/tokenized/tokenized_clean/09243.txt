cars are very important for our society .it ensures our mobility which becomes more and more important in these days .so cars became an important part of our world .but how will the situation be in twenty years ?in many countries in africa or south america , often called the third world , cars are not as important as in europe or as in the united states .but in the last years more and more people get cars becuase they become more important .the number of cars increases every year and even the increasing rate becomes higher .so there is no end in sight .it is certain that in the third world will be much more cars than today .but what is the situation in the so called `` western world  ?fifty years ago cars were luxus .but today a car bellongs to life standard .only few families have no car and the production of cheap small cars like the smart enforce the development to have more than one car .so also in the western world the number of cars increases .but it is on a high level , so perhaps the growth will stop in a few years .but there are no signs that the situation will turn to fewer cars .less visible , but nonetheless important is the situation of the streets .all over the world streets become better and better .this leads to a more comfortable feeling in your car what finally leads to more cars .but i think the crucial question is not how many cars we can count per person .the question is how many people will live on the world in twenty years .at the moment the population grows very fast .during the last twenty years the population increased of about 70 % .it is not certain if the growth remain as high but sure is : population will grow !and more people buy more cars .as a result i ca nt agree with the statement .i think there are no doubts that the number of cars will become much higher .
