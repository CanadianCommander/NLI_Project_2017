people could be successful without trying new things but just by following customs only for a short term , but can not keep being successfull for a long term without trying new things .that is because society and trend always change .i d like to bring an example of beepers and mobile phones in japanese market .the beeper has recently vanished after 40 years of history from its japanese market .it used to be one of the most popular mobile goods untill mobile phone was commonly used .i remember when was in school , all of my friends had one and it was the main tool to communicate with each other .if you had a bisiness to deal with beepers - could be a manufacture , supplier of materials to manufactures or agencies to make deals with consumers - your business back then must have been successful and prosperous .however , mobile phone became more and more popular since over 10 years ago and it has now overtaken the beepers .nowadays almost everyone has one or even more than two , like one for private use and the other for business , and it s hard for many people to imagine a life without them .as being involved in the beeper business if you decided not to go into mobile phone business but stick to the beepers because you did not feel comfortable with trying new things and did not like to take risks , your business dealing with beepers must have gradually diminished and it was no longer successful .in any category , as i meantioned above , trends constantly change and you ca nt stick to the same thing forever .to be successful , it is necessary to adopt new things to go with the latest trend and it always require some risks but it s , i think , unfortunately unavoidable in order to get success .
