everybody enjoys life .it is not necessary to be young to enjoy life .yes it is true that people enjoy life in different manner and different styles .everybody has different ways of enjoying life .there are people who are young physically and there are people people who are young by heart .in my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do .firstly , young people have the physical as well as mental strength to enjoy life more than older people .the adrelinine in younger people keeps them going .in todays fast moving world no one has time to wait for the right occasion and for the right time .young people are more energetic and lively .young people have the physical attributes to enjoy that bit more than older people .secondly , the opportunites , the occasions for young people to enjoy are much more than older people .for enjoyment they can go to parties , clubbing , lounges etc .they can aslo enjoy on any occasion because they have the time and energy to keep going .todays world caters to more hangout places , joints where young people can enjoy themselves .there are more entertainment places opening for young where they can enjoy themselves to the fullest than there are for older people .young people can also find enjoyment at their work places or colleges .lastly , young people have more options than older people .young people tend to have more friends collegues etc .young people can adapt to places and adjust to places faster which makes it easier for them to enjoy .however older people also enjoy to an extent .older people try to find enjoyment in more subtle things .they enjoy in a different manner .for them enjoyment is more quite and calm .they try to find enjoyment in small things .yet according to me younger people enjoy life more than older people since they are full of energy and adrelinine .
