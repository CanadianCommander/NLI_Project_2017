first of all , i totally agree with the statement because in advertisement they make the product looks shiny and in its perfect conditions and the results we see on it are not real because it was shown to us by actors not real consumers .based on my experience , i tried many anti-dandruff shampoos that i ve seen on television advertisements and they did nt work out .i followed the instructions on the bottle but i think it has something to do with the product its self .i tried another product i didn s see before on television and it worked out very well with me .i think what turns out to be good with you does nt have to be with everyone else .for example , in cars we see these powerful cars that can go through any difficulties from climbing mountains to driving it in mud and on deep snow on the roads or off the roads while actually not all cars are capable of doing such things .they show us cars going very fast and you think that it is safe to drive in such speed while it s not .the most dangerous advertisements i see as aparent are the kid s advertisement specially when they show some chocolates and candies and the kid in the advertisement is eating as many as he can without brushing and his teeth are perfect while in real life that is not true .but considering the people behind these advertisement , we find that they are companies trying to make money out of their product so they have to make their product look the best way possible to convince the viewers to go and buy it .making advertisement is an industry now and the companies has the right make their product looks perfect but i think the viewers also have the right to know whether this advertisement is real and the product is like what they see before they buy it .
