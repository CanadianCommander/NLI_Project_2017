in japan , which is my home country , some people may prefer a travel in a group led by a tour guide .however personally , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first , a group travel led by a tour guide prevents me from visiting places under my own decisions and interests .for example , when i went to china in 1995 , i chose a group travel because chinese travel industry was not matured in this time and then i had to pay more cost for a self travel by time consuming procedures like a visa premission than i did in a group travel .however , i missed visiting most interested place in china , a great wall by the unexpected change of tour schedule .second , a group travel led by a tour guide allows me not to study about the place by myself .for instance , when i went to spain with my wife , a tour guide provided us with much information about the place .however , because tour guide allowed us only to listen his explanations , my wife and i forgot almost all information which he gave .on the other hand , i went to thailand by myself in my college days .i prepared for the travel by reading many books related to the country .as a result of self preparation , i could enjoy whole travel .furtheremore , i can learn much information by heart because of self efforts .of course , there are some advantages in traveling in a group led by a tour guide .for instance , in a group travel , i can enjoy a travel more safer than in a self travel .i have bad experience that i was robbed my belongings in italy because i walked downtown in midnight alone .i believe that i could avoid such a dangerous accidents by a group travel .however totally , on my opinion , a self travel s benefits are not outweighed by those of a group travel .therefore , for the reasons mentioned above , i completely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
