in the past few decades cars have been the most useful vehicle in the world .the use of car is still increasing rapidly .there are many people saying the negative aspect s of cars , though i think the increase of car use will go on in the next twenty years or maybe more .the carbon dioxide which is exausted from tha cars are said to be a big cause of global warming .this negative aspect should be prevented , but there are still great share of cars .why can not people use trains and other social tranceportation .in that way car user will be decreasing and it will be good for the enviroment .when i was still a child and did not have the drivers license i thought the pollution the car makes was evil and something that one need to prevent .after a few years when i took the license the thought of pollution went somewhere else from my mind .it is just so useful .i think cars are like smoking .we know that this is a bad habit .despite the fact , people just can not quit it .the usefullness of car adicts the people .no one wants to be in a bus or a train when you see the people in there getting squashed and misserable .we than think to use the car , more private and convenient .i believe cars would not decrease forever .people can not prevent th e desire of using such useful thing so we need to think of another way , like inventing a car that is ecology .the amount of car share will be increasing as the population rise .the decrease of population is the only way of decreasing the car .
