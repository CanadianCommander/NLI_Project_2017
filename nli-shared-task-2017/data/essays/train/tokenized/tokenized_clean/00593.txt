i agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .today , mass media has a great power on human being .boys want to wear nike shoes because michael jordan wears it on tv and girls want to buy some specific type of dress , for example , levi s low rise jeans because jenifer lopez or brittany spears wear it on tv .if those products , such as nike shoes or levi s low rise jeans , were not on tv or magazine , i do not think they would sell like that much even though they had still same quality .we watch tv almost everyday and the commecial says that we can be as good at basketball as machael jordan if we wear nike .tv tells us that we can be as pretty as brittany spears or jennifer lopez only if we wear levi s low rise jeans .there is korean saying that `` if the food looks good , it makes taste great .it does not necessarily mean that the looks of food make any difference on taste .but people are easily influenced by what we see , and it effects on what we think about the food .i read an article about a cleaning machine when i was in korea .one small company invented the cleaning machine .it was a small machine with wheels and it could go around the floor and clean up by itself .after it came out , other big company started to make same kind of cleaning machine .they advertised it on tv and in newspapers .which one would you buy , the small company s cheap but nice one , or the big company s more expensive , but ween on tv one ?after the advertisement , the small company could not continue that business because people only bought the big company s cleaning machine .this is a true story .advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are because we are very easily influenced by what we see .
