if this question has been asked approximately 30 years ago , probably the answer would be specialisation .nevertheless the world system has being sharply changing after the technological enhancements ; so , the kind of having information .now , i believe that , having a wider academic information is more valuable that just concentrating on one , because of globalisation , optimisation .the first reason i believe in this manner is , the wide spreading concept of being a  global  person .after the enhancements of the communications technologies all over the world , owning information had become so important .that is why every individual company tried to have as much knowledge as it can .as a result of this everyone has begun to have at least some information about every issue .if you are so stubborn not to join this trend you may not be a social individual in todays life .thus , instead of specialising for a subject , having a framework for several kinds subjects is a more valid in todays world .apart from this social point of view , broad knowledge of information is extremely significant for optimisation of ongoing jobs .since all of the tasks takin place in our world has several varialbles in it ; altering the way the work goes on .for a better optimisation - even for approximation - you have to have knowledge from variety of branches .the paragon is industrial enginners .this enginner type is not concentrating on a specific kind of engineerin , even those people get courses from managemant and economics as their core studies .as a consequence of this , they have the opportunity of having a wider perspective for optimisation on going works .besides , having broad knowledge of several academic subjects may yield to unexpected outcomes such as deficiency of required knowledge or overexagiration of the known infomation .this insufficient information , may lead to false results for a work .for instance , if you really want to work for an enhancement of product , or a new innovation , you may come to a mistaken product , which in return may mean , waste of money and a lot of time .overexagiration of knowledge unconciously may also lead to same conclusion .to sum up as i consider all of these three results , i come to a conclusion that haing a wider academic information accumulation is better compared to specialisation on a topic .however , people should be aware of the danger of overexagiration and deficiency of knowledge .
