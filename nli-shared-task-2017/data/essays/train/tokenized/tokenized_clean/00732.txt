cars have been the means of transportation around the world for centuries .it is no doubt that the car is a major part of many peoples lives .so will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now ?well , i think that the car will very much be present twenty years from now and probably with more users then ever , with a few changes to the car s functions and design of course .i think that the car will change greatly over a twenty year period .resulting in a burst of popularlity with many individuals around the world .i think that many of the functions of the cars will be changed as well .i think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .i think this because there are many problems arising around the world regarding the price of gasoline .not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming .i feel that the car industry will thus , shift its vision on cars from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric cars .these electric cars will not only run on small amounts of electricity , but it will also have no exhaust pollution , creating a better and cleaner environment .it is because that i think these changes will occur that i say that the number of cars will not diminish in the future .i feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .i also think that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years because i think that many people in many socities are very attached to the car .it is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many countries .for example , it is a tradition to get your drivers license when you turn the age of 16 in america .also it is a sign of wealth in many countries to own a car in many countries , such as china .therefore , i feel that there will not be a decline in the use of cars because ; by losing the car you will lose many traditions , and traditions are a part of culture .so it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entire part of culture from there lives within a short period of twenty years .the attachment to cars by the human society and the possiblity to alter cars to better suit the needs of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of cars will not decline in twenty years .
