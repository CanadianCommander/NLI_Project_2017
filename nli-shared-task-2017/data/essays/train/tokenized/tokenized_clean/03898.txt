some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and some people do nt think so .in my opinoin , i agree it .first , ideas and concepts can build a good basis .second , ideas and concepts can direct them to a correct way .for the reasons , i agree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , understanding ideas and concepts can build a good basis .if you want to do anything well , you should have a good basis , for example , building a prefect building .in fact , when a building has a good condition , it must have a prefect basis .besieds , after you understand ideas and concepts , you will build a nice basis .plus , when you have a nice basis , you will be able to solve any problems you need .that s why i think ideas and concepts can build a good basis .moreover , understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way .most prblems are resulted from a incorrect way .when you want to start a thing , the key point is that if you start from a right way .however , most people often ignore this point .it always makes them regret .as a result , a good begining must have a correct way .in fact , a correct way depends on how much ideas and concepts you understand .that s why i think understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way .in conclusion , i believe that you will always make a good job when you understand ideas and concepts .i also believe a prefect job is from a good basis and a correct way .as a result , i totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
