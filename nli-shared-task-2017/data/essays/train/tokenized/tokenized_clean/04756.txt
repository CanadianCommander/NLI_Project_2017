some people believe that it is more important for students understanding ideas and concepts than learn facts .however , i strongly disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts thatn it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons .learnig facts is faster ways to learn for students .for exaple , when i was a sixteen years old , i had a first part time job , which was joying an assembly line in a beer factory .i expected to the job was going to easy and simple since i learned that the concepts of assembly lines and undersood how the assembly line worked .however , the job is not easy and simple at all .i had to focus on another people and think what should i do next .i made a lot of mistakes and warned from the boss .even though , i understood how it worked and the concept , i did not what was going to be facts , i did make the same or simillar mistakes .however , one i knew the consequences i said myself i was not going to make same mistakes again .and i could learn to handle the job very fast .therefore , learning facts is a faster way to learn than understanding and concepts .peole usually remember what they learn from facts .when i was a six years old , i entered to an elementaly school in japan .first day of school , i was not used to attending a school : therefore , i missbehaved such as not pay attentions in class and talking with friends .even though , my parents told me i have to behave in class room .i had not know what was going happen next , so i wasnot well bihave .teachers punished and warned me and i finally realized facts of missbihave in classrooms .even now , i still remember and i do not think i am not going to forget since facts are really rememberble for me .theexpirience above shows that learnig facts are easy to remember and stay longer than understanding ideas and concepts .students are be able to remember ideas and concept because once they understood .but they can forget easily since they just understood in their brains .therefore , i totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to learn facts than for them to undestand ideas and concepts .
