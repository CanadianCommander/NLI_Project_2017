`` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .this could be a well said joke .i totally disagree with the statement .how is it possible when every quarter a car manufacturer roll out a new model .is it possible in the era when a car manufacturer is about to develop and market a car which would be in reach of the common man who currently rides a bicycle .i wish the statement would have been true but my minds says `` in your dreams  .the growth one sees in the automobile market is extraordinary .there is such a stiff competition all around that even if one of the manufacturer is out , there are 3 other s who are in fray to capture it and thus increase their customer share .let me introduce an example to enhance my claim .i would consider the indian market for this .in india , a decade ago there was only one car giant called maruti udyog limited ( mul ) .even mul has consolidated its position by throwing out old indegenous players like hindustan motors or foreign players like fiat .in less than 5 years of gaining supremacy mul faced stiff challange from local manufaturers like tata motors or foreign companies like daewoo , hyundai , general motors , honda etc .cut to 2006 , we see hundereds of car models flooded in indian market and many more roaring to get in .in a time when people are saying that globalization is at its best do we see this trend to decline .no ways !its ought to increase .let me introduce yet another point to strengthen my argument .today the cost of living across the world is at very high .people are lavishly spending money on the materials they like to posses and belive me this is a trend which is not going to stop .generation by generation it has continued and it will do so for the next twenty , thirthy or hundered years .as a result people will buy cars to show of their status and thus unkowingly support me in my claim .people may argue my point with the fact that fuels i.e. petrol and diesel are rapidly depleting and with depleting fuel reserves it would be difficult for cars to survive for next tewnty years and thus reducing the number of cars .but with the advancement of technology , today , market is flooded with hybrid cars which can run both on conventinal fuels as well as electricity .i agree that this may be expensive option currently but the pace with which technology is progressing and the amount of competition the market has , i see a drastic reduction in their prices .once the prices are down how can we stop people from buying cars which would be their best bet in terms of money and in terms of reducing pollution .thus , i would reiterate that in the shrinking world of globalization the days are not far when we will be out there buying a small size car to move rapidly between diffrent rooms in our homes .now , with such an encrhoachment , do we see that in next twenty years there would be fewer cars .again my mind says , `` in your dreams  .
