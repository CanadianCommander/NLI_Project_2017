i think that is many important understand ideas than learn the information on memory .first , when you understand a concept you forgot it only if you want .in fact when you learn and understand an information , you put it in your mind .if you can live a particular situation about this information you can make it up and you understand better what you learnt .for example , sometimes you have learn on memory a lesson because you have had an exam about it .at that time you have cought a good vote .now , if you think , it is possible that what you learn that day , you do nt remember it .i have got it .but in the other end , when you have studied for an exam with interest and you have understood the concepts , today you can say that you have learn it because you remember it and you can make them real .second , if we speak , in specific , about scientific arguments , i think that you must understand it because , if you do nt get it , you can not applicate scientific theories in the reality .for example , my friend was nt able to pass the math exams .i must say that she does nt like math and she does nt understand it .in this way she makes many times this test and she can only learn all the theories on memory but in the exercises she was nt able to show the results .when she studied math and understand it she was able to make her exercises and passed the exams !she got it because she learnt the math theories , but also she applicated it in the good way for looking for the results .often i think that is difficult understood ideas but if we applicate it in the known situation of our lives , we can understood better and do nt forg
