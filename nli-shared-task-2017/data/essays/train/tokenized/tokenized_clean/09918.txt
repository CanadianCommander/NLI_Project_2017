definetly i agree with the idea that young people enjoy more life that older ones mainly because we get knowledge in an eassier way , we emphasize on the importance of the cooperation skill and in general because we have a better sense of humor .firstly , young people assimilate the existing and new information efficiently .we are like an empty box to which we add new ideas and conceptions .for instance , we addecuate perfectly to the information age by the use of internet , i/pod or new devices .moreover we learn without much difficulty foreign languages like english , chinese or french .consequently , we enjoy the new benefits of this age .secondly , young people like working on groups which is essential for developing the cooperation skill and fit better on this age .nowadays everybody is inter conected and the enviroment is more complex than before by the existence of more competidors therefore a team work is vital if we want to survive , moreover young are the ones who practice it perfectly because we do not find any differences among people or we do not have erronous conceptions from the past .this skill let us make a lot of friends and enjoy much better our job and study hours .therefore we enjoy more our life .thirdly , young people have a better sense of humor .this skill let us find the possitive side of the things .for instance i do not get too much depressed when things do not go well but my parents do , getting depressed many times .to sum up , as far as i am concerned young people beacuse of their atitud to life like assimilating new ideas without any problem , having innate the cooperation skills or having a good sense of humor enjoy more life than older people .
