it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i agree with the following statement .students are young and generally do not enought experiences for their life .they do not responsibility for their life and they are generally very busy on their life .thats why , there are many reasons for my support idea .firstly , they are young and they have not done enought experiences for their life .i am a faculty at the dokuz eylul university in izmir , in turkey for seven years .i have studied a lot of students .in my experinces , they understand and believe ideas and concepts because they are so young for life and they have not done anythings .secondly , almost all students are very busy .they learn a lot of things .they have studied on their life such as homework , listening , reading , speaking and writing .however they have not had any experinces such as earning life , earning money , doing help anybody etc .actually i do nt know another countries but at least , in turkey is this .our curriculum teach generally good math , geography , history , biology or anything but it does nt teach life knowledge , this is big mistake and turkis educational system and its curriculum has to be change .finally , they don  have enought responsiblity .in my view , this is educational system s problem .for instance , in turkey almost all students go to secondary school and high school .they study and they do homework .neverthless , usullally they do nt do any home made .in my opinium , if we succed for new generation , we have to learn life s facts and we have to give more responsibilities .we have to change our traditional educational systems .they have learn life , world , and world s problem such as war , peace , environment , conflict and etc .because , tomorrow life for them .
