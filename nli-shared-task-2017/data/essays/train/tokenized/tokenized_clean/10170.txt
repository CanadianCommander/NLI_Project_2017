students education should be complete in order to let young people develop their own way of thinking in all the majors like maths , physics , psicology and art .that the students learn facts is a good way to understand ; however , to learn ideas and concepts is a way to develop their way to think and to understand facts .there are some reasons why to learn ideas and concepts is better that just learn facts .first , ideas an concepts permit the individual to understand facts .for example , in sociology to understand the fact that the beatles were so famous whe ca nt just said because of their music was very good .we have to go deeper and think that they were famous because the idea that they develop in youn people about freedom and happiness .the result was that young people idea about be free was reflected in this band .so , basically the ideas later become concepts .then , most of the theories of any branch of study are based on ideas and concepts accepted for the experts .that s how science works .scientists develop their reasearch based in concepts already establish long long time ago in order to define another concept .the we can said that a fact is representation of ideas and concepts .finally , facts come when an idea or concept is represented in something that happened .we can said that is and example .in terms of the education facts help to understand how things develop , for example , how human being appeared in this world .there are some natural concepts , ideas and theories that are just that supositions but the fact is that the human being exist and we do nt have still an aswer .as a conclusion , the relation between ideas , concepts and facts are close .the first two develop the las one .the reason why is better to know ideas and concepts is beausea in this way you can find a fact
