i do not agree with the statement that the young poeple nowadays do not pay much attention to helping their communities .in times of urgent need , the young people are always on the forefront in helping others .it is true that the young people are nowadays are much more carefree than the previous generations .however , this does not mean that they are apathetic to the isssues concerning their communities .take children for example .with the help of their school and parents , students are always known to conduct cleanliness and health awareness drives .recently the children near my block were collecting donations from everyone in the suburb to help the old people of the country .the schools are playing a very vital role in encouraging the children to take such initiatives .children as a part of their extra activities tend to go door-to-door creating awarensess about issues like proper usage of plastic , health and sanity , spread of diseases etc .the younger generation is also actively help their communities in case of emergencies .due to increased use of technology , the younger generation is much more aware about the incidents all over the world .youngsters tend to motivate people to act against unjust decision and rules through active responses .recently my country was plagued by a huge earthquake rendering thousands starving and homeless .the help that the youngsters offered was tremendous .thousands of young volunteers with foods and supplies arrived overnight to help those in need .all the student bodies in colleges and universities collected cash and kind to help the disaster stricken population .i know many friends who regularly volunteer to feed and cook for the poor .it is true that present generation has some flaws .it has become much more indifferent to political issues and developments .but taking into account all the factors , it would be unfair to generalise their behaviour as negligence .
