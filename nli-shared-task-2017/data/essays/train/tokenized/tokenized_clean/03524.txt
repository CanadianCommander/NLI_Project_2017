i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .the advantage is that when going on a trip , you are not familiar with the place , so being led by a tour guide is better than going around the place by yourself and getting lost .the disadvantage is that you ca nt choose which place to go to , you also have to wake up very early and get prepared for the journey you are having that day .last year , i went to guilin , which is in china .my family hired a tour guide .i remember that we had to wake up at 7am and had to be ready by 7:30am .we went around the city and my legs were very sore by the time we returned to the hotel .the tour guide was not really friendly and my family was not pleased with her .we also had to go in a group , which was not such a pleasant experience .there was another family who was always late for arrivals .and everybody was displeased with them .another experience was that a few years ago in malaysia , my mother also hired a tour guide .the tour guide was very greedy and not very polite .on another trip to bangkok , we did not hire a tour guide and we went around bangkok by ourselves .i think that my family and i had a much more delightful holiday and we had a lot of fun there .in my opinion , i think that hiring a tour guide is not as good as going around by yourself .though you may not know the place very well , you can always ask the local people who live there , i am sure at least one of them is willing to tell you the directions of the place .tour guides may not be very professional and their manners may not be that polite .so i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
