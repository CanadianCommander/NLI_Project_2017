the people should help their community .but some people do not help their communities , especially young people .because they belive that they are happy in being this situation .but they are not .they can not see that because they lost theirself in this complicated world .because of growing very rapidly and basicly in that global world make them careless person .but i firmly agree this statement .this are my following reasons .firstly , nowadays young people do not give enough time their communities .they suppose that they can live alone with not communicating in this developing world .actually we can not accuse them completely .because in this information era when we live they are used to play computer games and surfing in internet .so they became people who do not go theaters and movies and do not participate in social activities .and these conditions help them to alleviate .moreover , young people do not give enough time their communities because they think that when they could start to walk they are free .and they can do everything what they want .so they neglect their families and their friends .when all young generation did this , the world has became worse place than before .they believe that they are free and they behave how they want .if they continue to do this , this stuation does not progress and it collapses .we must be carefull when growing a child .if only we do like this , we can protect our futures and our childrensin conclusion , i firmly believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
