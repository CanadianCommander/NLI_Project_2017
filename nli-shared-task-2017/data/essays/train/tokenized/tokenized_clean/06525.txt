well history has given enough examples that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing the same thing .i strongly beleive in that .i have good experince about that i worked six years steadly working in a same manner as like other in my medical proffession but than after i shiffted to new research based studies and that helped me greatly in improving my knowledge and offcourse my life and above that patient life .i still remember when i discovered new method of treatment how dramatically the results i got but i have taken risk , i left my job for a year and did research on very minute things and definetly thats pay me alot .as it is mention in history the great `` colombus `` found the west indies by doing different , like great scientist `` gallelio  who is the first person to say that earth is round like a ball .so it is like cristal clear that if some one want to become a successfull person he / she has to do something new .today is a world of competetion or we can say that `` survival of the fitest  .one should do some thing different from another .today world is going into new directions we are exploring in technology , in space , under the earth its only because of those successfull person who did something different .think if we wouldn `` t has done these different things in life we wiol probably would be same as animals no inventions no light no telephones .today we can not imagine the world wiyhout theses wonderfull objects .in the end i would reccomend that every man who want tobe successful in life should think differently and do thing differents but only and only for improving a man kind and its nature only than a one will be remember you a greatt successfull person .
