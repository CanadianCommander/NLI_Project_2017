today there is nearly no product which can be sold without any advertisement .and the past has shown that those product who tried failed more often than were succesfull buyed by their customers .so this indicates for me that advertisements make prouducts more that they are because if it would not be like this a product could exist without its advertisement .so i agree with that statement !it is clear that advertisement gives the image of a product and also helps to reach the buyers .and most of the companys know how they can use this .they try to give their product the best image they could because than the customers will recognize it and buy it maybe next time in supermarket or somewhere else .to give an example i want to explain how it happend to me when an advertisement makes me buy a product .a few weeks ago i mentioned an advertisement shown on television .it was a new hair-shampoo which promises nice hair and a great experience by washing your hair .than the next day i went to the supermarket to buy such an shampoo .but when i washed my hair i could not feel the great experience of washing hair .plus , and this was more important , my skin on my head was red because of the shampoo .this makes it obvious to me that this product was not as good as it was on its advertisement .so my own experience showed me that advertisements makes products seem much better just to sell more of them .but i think it is normal that advertisments make products seem better than they really are because its function is to atract people !today you seem silly if you believe in what an advertisement promises to you .so , its just thay goes today when you want to sell things !
