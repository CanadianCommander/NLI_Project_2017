well that is a good question , because i never thaught of it before !in my country young do nt get a chance to see eachother after class !for most of us always goes to cram school till 9 or 10 p.m. after we will have to go home immidiutly or else the police will think that : hay !what is a middle school fooling around at that late , is he going to rubb someone .and then he will take you back to the police station .after that your parents will have to pick ypu up !but , we always log on msn or sky-pe to communicate with each other !and we might spent 1 or 2 hours doing that a day .by doing that we will spent about 6 hours to communicate .other than that we often og out together on weekends to go biking or fishing and even golfing !sometimes we go to others house to discuss homeworks together .even if we are not talking about homeworks we will talk about something like ecosystem ecological and science .that way we can spent some time together .but if any big test is comming we will stop doing that , that is for our goods .after the activity we have done all week we proubably spent more time with friends than our own parents .so i think we have given enough time tohelp our communities .and even too much !now i think i can say that we have already spent enough time on that .and also i am not agreed with that .i think i have already expland why i made up my mind to disagrss with that , so i do nt have to do it again right .no matter who said that [ young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities } he should take the word back !
