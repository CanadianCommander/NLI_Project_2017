specialization or broad knowledgewhether or not specialization should be favored in academics is a controversial issue .it is not easy to completely state that specialization on a specific subject is better compared to having broad knowledge of academic subjects .however , i belive that specialization on a specific subject should be accompanied with a broad knowledge of other subjects .firstly , it is practically not possible and reasonable to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .human time and energy would not be sufficient to have knowledge on many issues .even though it is ideal , specialization in a subject is only possible for mankind .to have a broad knowledge on academic subjects is not reasonably possible , since it is contrary to the idea of academics .furthermore , specialization would help for the evolution of human civilization .progress could only be achieved by knowledge and only by specilization such a knowledge could be achieved .knowledge is attained through concentration , research and experimentation .however it is not possible to experiment in all realted academic subject .for instance , if newton did not contentrate on physics but have bits and pieces of physics , biology and chemistry he wouldnot be able to develop his theories .similarly , if freud did not specialize on psychoanalysis many of his assertions would not exist .on the contrary , it must be kept in mind that an academics require an awareness .in order to be a serious academic , apart from specialization general knowledge and awareness is required .an academic in social sciences should be open to learning about chemistry for instance .specialization only has a value if is exercised within the context of relevant disciplines .for instance , a commercial lawyer , must know the codes , doctrine as well as the relevant history , economic structure , managerial problems , business practice .consequently , in the 21st century it is required for humans to be specialized .the primary reason for specialization is the progress of mankind .in addition to that , one most always keep in mind that a specialist always have to have broad knowledge
