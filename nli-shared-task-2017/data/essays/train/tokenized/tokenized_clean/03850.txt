i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , an advertisement is in the between reality and imagine .for example , if some medicine company advertise made by rabbit blood by showing the ingrediants and the real processing methods , nobody do nt want to buy or sell .i know this example seems like over-expression ; however , let think about reality , it totally depend on mild imagine .the mild imagine is cute and humorous .the second reason that i agree the topic is that .the main objective of advertisement is to persuasive buyers or costomers .it is the most important to advertise .at this point , to get agreement some product become more beautiful and gorgerous using new high technology such as potograpic technic , various grapic technic with computor .so the development technology is creasing to stimulate customer s view .as a results , many company use the effect and then the results make it to be see most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
