the issue at hand is whether the number of cars in use will reduce , as compared to today , over the next twenty years .according to me , this statement is not in harmony with my thoughts .i think that the number of cars in use will , infact , increase over the next twenty years .firstly , using a car adds upto the convenience of an individual .it reduces the travel time , that is , one can reach his destination earlier in a car .it also gives comfort to a person during his travel , not stressing him out because the journey .so , people will think of buying cars rather than wasting time and getting stressed out because of the journey .this will lead to a considerable increase in the number of cars in use .secondly , having a car also adds up to the status of an individual .most of the people predict an individual s personality by looking at the car he drives , that is , the car speaks for the man .as years pass by , the physical appearance of the car will become more and more attractive , thereby hypnotising people .this will help an individual to show of his personality by purchasing an appropriate car .so , people will prefer to buy cars over years in order to create a distinctive appeal over other people .thirdly , considering the advancements in vehicle techology , it has become easy for an individual to afford a car .the modern technology and innovations have brought down the car prices considerably , which now provides an opportunity to the bourgeis class of people to afford a car .as , we know the major part of the world s population comprises of the middle class , i think , this will considerably account in increase in the number of cars over the next twenty years .also , the recent technology has increased the efficiency of a car to run more miles on comparatively less number of gallons of fuel , that has attracted a lot customers which will again account in the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years .finally , i conclude by saying that , as long as technology and human desire exist the number of cars in use will keep on increasing over time .
