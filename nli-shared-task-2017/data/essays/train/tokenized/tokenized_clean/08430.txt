many people think that products which are showen throgh advertising are real .but my opinion is that most advertisemens focus on making products look like better than they really are .because their function is to make products look nice to sell .and in the modern society which has a lot of products , they have to get opportunity to sell throgh appearence of product .the advertisements is capacity to sell effeciently .that s why they try to show the products seem much better than themselves .without using the product , nobody knows ability of product .before the customers choose some products , they are hesitated .to them who are confused the choice , advertisements have to make them purchase thire own products .how ?through charming feactur .they have to suggest to the customer before they choose some products through that products seem nice .additionally , nowdays all technology have been improving .so the copy of some product is so easy .if some company invent the product which attract to the coustomers , as soon as other company also make similar product .in so many choice of same product , coustomers try to compare with other companies .in same technology , it might be same ability of product .then , how to sell more than other companise ?the answer is the advertisement .but other companies also try to make nice advertisement .then how to show that our products is better than other product ?the answer is to make products seem much better than they really are .nowdays business is unlimited competion world .but there is limited technology .that s why most advertisements make effort that products look better than themselves and others .conclusionly , i am sure that most advertisements try to make products look better than they really are .that s why the advertisements exist and in thesedays without showing well , the products can be choosed by coustomers .
