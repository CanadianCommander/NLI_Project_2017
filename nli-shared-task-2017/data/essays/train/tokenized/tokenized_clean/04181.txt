many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i definately agree with that .that the statement is true , could easily be shown by any cientific research comparing what young people in general do now and what they used to do in earlier generations .in my opinion different reasons let to this .one reason is , that , compared to the past , people live in a more individualistic way .most people grow up in a small family , often not even with both but only one parent , and family ties become less and less strong .while in the old days there where always uncles and grandparents etc. to play an important role in the upbringing of a child , nowadays often there is no relationship at all because being a family member is not enough of a reason to keep in contact .this has an important impact on a childs development .if you shouldnt even care about your family , why should you care about your community !this change of the way how people grow up came along with a shift of values .for our parents generation for example it was normal and looked upon as very positiv for children to help their mother with the cooking , to look after their younger brothers and sisters , to visit and spend time with their grandparents .nowadays , these actions are just not rated very highly .if a child exeeds at sport , is very smart , very beautiful or anything else related to it as a single human being , in society this counts much more then just being nice and helpful .it is all about being successful yourself and not about how you interact with others .so it is no wonder that young people tend to put their own interest first before they consider anyone elses interest !it is only logical that children or young adults choose to do things that others will find attractive and important .
