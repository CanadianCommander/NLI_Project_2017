there are too many different ways for a student to learnd and undesrtand different kind of topics , but there is huge difference between understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts .first of all , the fact that a students it s only understanding the concepts it mean he is learning .understanding is the base of education , and the base of knowledge .for example , if one student has a test , and he memorize everything , he migh be good at the test , but weeks later , if you ask him about the same topic and if he is not able to answer any question about the topic , that means that he did nt learn anything about it .secondly , understanding ideas is the best way for learning , and remember different facts .for example , when you are able to understand some topic , and you are able to answer any question about it , that mean that you actually learn something about , maybe not everything but just what you thougt it was important for you .finally , the main reason why students now a days feel confortable when their are going to present any kind of test or exam , is because they undesrtood what they read and the undesrtood the main idea of the subject or topic they where asked to study .for example , when a student has his final exam and he was all night studing and he did good on his test , that s because he undestood most of the information , and that s one of the most important things for a student to be succesfull .in conclution , i totally agree with the statement because i think that by understanding the ideas and the concept you could better learn they way that thing happened , and by that you could understand the facts .if you learn , it s because you understood .understanding ideas and concepts will make you learn about everything you want , whenever you want .
