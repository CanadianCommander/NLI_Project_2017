many people believe that young people nowadays do nt give enought time to helping their communities , other people , instead , say that the young people are nearest than the old people , at the their communities problem .on the one hand , the younge people have most problem nowadays .in fact , in this years the world is change , because there so many criminals and the cities aren-t safety as twenty years ago .i m a young boy , and i can see with my eyes the change of my city .for the young people is not easy to live in this jungle . ..secondly the young people nowadays than twenty years ago , going at school and at university and the time are so little . .in fact , i m a student and when i come back to the university i haven-t many time to dedicate for my hobbies . ..or other job .the new young people spend most of the daily time at school !!on the other hand , is true the fact that more young people , often , when come back home , play at videogames or speack between other boys and girl , with internet . ..instead can use this time for help their communities .but this new generations , is the generation of internet and is more difficult to teach the importance of the community .to sum up , the young people have few time to dedicate at their hobbies , but when they have a free time , their use this precious hours for videogames , internet . ..and other hobbies .in my opinion , i m a student and i attend at university of milan , i have very few time . ..but at the week end , when i return to my house , i think at my community .at sunday i organize with my friends , the games for the children of my town , and i m happy because i see the smile on the face of these children .is in these moments that i can say that i have do somethings of good .
