i think to be specialised in one specific subject is good , but is not enough for your personnal development .first of all , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people .i mean , if your knowledge is really broad , you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of differents subjects with a lot of different people .being open minded in your knowledge leads you , most of the time , of being open minded socially .it is important to be interested in several things , that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations , and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point ; whatever you actually want to do in life .furthermore , the more you learn , the more you want to learn ( and need to learn actually ) .the wilingness to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject , but a single subject may leads you to isolate youself in technical considerations that non one can actually understand , whereas plurality of subject makes your mind breath .it is no longer a question of ` academic  knowledge , it is a question of curiosity .according to me , acknowlegment goes the same way as it goes for food , that is to say if you eat the same food everyday , you will just be quickly disgusted .therefore , if you just study one single subject , even if you go deeply through it , you will be disgusted one day somewhat .to summarize , i rekon it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things , and it makes you so much curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject .i agree to say that learning about a specific subject is a good think , because everything can not be superficial in your life , but if you have only that in your life , that not enough to make this one fun
