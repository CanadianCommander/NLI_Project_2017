although there may be some special cases where youngsters are helping their communities , i agree that they are not spending enough time .there are three reasons why i arrived at this conclusion .firstly , in these days every one is striving for a good career - to get a good job in some reputed company or to start his own business .in this race for a good career , most of us will not care for what is going on with the outside world .instead we will concentrate only on our aim until we get it in our hand .we will motivate all our thoughts in that direction .we will spend each and every second in our life for that goal .so we are not getting time to help our communities .another reason is that , now a days a person becomes famous mostly because of his wealth .he will be given respect based upon his fortune .in this scenario , it s no surprise that every one becomes greedy for wealth and fame .so we does nt waste our time for non-profit activities i.e , activities which will give no profit in form of money like helping our communities .we will focus all our time on doing some work to earn some thing .one more reason is that most of us enjoy playing sports .so if we find any leisure time we will cater it to playing instead of doing any other thing .what we also feel is that playing is conducive to health and also maintaining a good physique always fetches .obviously there will be no free time to us when we are spending it in another way .finally , youngsters now a days are giving more preference to their career , accomplishing wealth and also maintaining good health .they are missing the fundamental rule of helping others , which inturn helps us .let s hope a time definitely comes when our people will realize this truth and thrive for the prosperity of our human community .
