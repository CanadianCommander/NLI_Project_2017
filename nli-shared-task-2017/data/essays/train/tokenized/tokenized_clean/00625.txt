i disagree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today by the following reasons .first , many people who live in local place will be not able to use the official translation system , trains and buses .in the near future , many railway companies and bus companies will cut thier local lines in order to cut the cost to move trains and buses .to get profit from the local lines , they need many passengers .but now the number of passengers are very few .so they can not get profit from the local lines and they have to cut the lines .if they wo nt cut the local lines , they need to increase their fees .thus , the people who live in local place want to and have to use their own cars .when i was elementary school student , i lived in hokkaido in japan .at that time , the service of many lines of japan national railway in hokkaido was stopped .thus , my father had to buy a car .second , the new technologies of car s engine will invent for saving gasoline .many people think that the cost of gasoline will increase and they will be not able to use gasoline to ride a car in the near future .but nowadays , some car dealer sell new cars which have a hybrid system ( gasoline and electricity ) , for example , toyota purius , honda insight and toyota estima .in europe , many car manifactures is trying to use diesel engine instead of gasoline engine .at last month , ceo of volkswagen came to japan and announce that they will sell many diesel cars in japan in the near future .thus , i think that fuel will remain in twenty yearsas above the reasons i showed , i can not agree the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .
