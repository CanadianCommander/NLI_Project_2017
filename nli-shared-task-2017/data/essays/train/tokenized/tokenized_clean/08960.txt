in recent years , some people argue that there will be fewer cars in use in near future since the innovations in transportation technology .however , the argument seems me far from reality .although , there are some studies in this direction , i do nt think that cars which have an important place in our lifes can be replaced by easily in twenty years .the statistics and the projects of governments justifies my beliefs .first of all , our past experience challenges to the argument .if we look at the statistics to understand how the tendency of the numbers of the car in use is , we see clearly that there is a permanent increase in car usage .in other words , the statistics of past data does not support the prediction in argument .it can easily be seen that all the statistics beginning from the invention of the cars to today demostrates that the usage of cars has dramatically increased .when people have better economic conditions , they desire to buy cars .inceases in population in all over the world also served this tendency .secondly , nowadays many developing countries continue to built new roads .for instance , in my country - turkey - there are regions where roads are not even suitable for cars and the government is too eager to expand the total kilometers of high ways to make car usage easier .in this purpose they expense a significant part of the budget to the transportation project .this efforts to increase high ways and to make them secure made also the people more eager to use cars .if we talk about a far future when there is no need to use cars because of the adaptation of helichopters or a fututre where world has connected with metros then we can expect the cars to disappear .but , today they are crucial for our comfort and i ca nt see a vehicle that can replace car usage .
