i agree that the most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .this is the mojor strategies doing by advertisement to reach much number of peole .but some of them can say lie for selll the product .advertisements only give the adventages and best sides of the product , you ca nt show any attention about it s disadvantages .consumers must also learned bad sides of the product .furthermore advertisement can tall much more than they are .in addition to this if you make lots of advertisement about the products poeple want to learn what it is than less advertising products .of course they will go to the shopping centr and look your products and usually this looking will finished with buying the product .in our country there are also lots of advertisement which make person boring in a rest of tv program .sometimes it takes twenty minutes .in fact as me all people change the channel to fin new one which is not advertise something .if advertiser want to take peole on tv they must do funny and interesting advertise .beside of that most advertisement may include more lie than others .this is selling method and we ca nt know if they tell us true or not .we must search and ask alot about products before buying it .we can get this informations who use that product before .and also politicians have to do some laws for advertisement .that laws mus limit the advertisement and include some punishment if they tell wrong in the advertisement .as a result there are lots of disadvantages and advantages of most advertisement .i agree that people want to buy product alot wth most advertsement but it mus nt include lies and harmfull things for people .they must be true
