i think broad knowledge of many subjects is good , but not always .so , i strongly disagree with the statement .i think , in mordern world one should be specific towards the subject , because there is a limitation for human beings .a person ca nt be perfect in everything .for example there is a difference between the knowledge of an engineer and a doctor .an engineer can better think about mechanical things like machines , instruments etc , where as a doctor can have better idea of presentation of human body than an engineer has .so , a doctor can better manipulate human body .so the knowledge is always limited for both of them .that is why , a person ca nt be a doctor or engineer at a time and ca nt be expert in both the fields .among doctors , a general practictioner has knowledge of human body but are not specialized in purticular area like cardiology , neurology etc .as they have limited knowledge , they refer the patients with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who always has better knowledge of heart activities than them .so , a specialist in specific subject is always better ..at last i will say that , due to limitations it is always better for a person to be specialized in a specific subject , because this is the way one can be perfect in the subject , and one can learn deeply about that subject that having little knowledge of many subjects .this is the way one can stand in this competetive world with the perfect knowledge in the particular subject , otherwise the person will neither have good knowledge of all the subjects nor will be the master in one .this is the way i want to be in future , and would expect the same from others .
