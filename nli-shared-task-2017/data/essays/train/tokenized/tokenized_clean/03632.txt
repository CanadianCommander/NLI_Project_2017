with rapid economic development , people face new situations everyday .some people try new things and take risks to succeed , others , on the other hand , continue doing what they already know how to do well .in my opinion , challenging new things and taking riskes would be a better choice for success .this essay will discuss some reasons to support my view .trying new things , successful people could find new matters what they can do .first of all , individuals can find their possibilities that they did not know .secondly , business persons could extend their business by trying new things .for instance , my friend who own cake shops increased his sales since he started inernet shop on a website .in a word , people can expand their lives by trying new matters .taking risks would lead people to succeed .firstly , individuals can change their circumstances to improve their lives .for example , i could improve my english by coming to canada that was risky yet i could get better job in canada .secondly , taking riskes , people can obtain big chances .my uncle made huge money by startign his business .in short , people can not improve their lives without taking chances .other people , on the other hand , have different view ; such as doing same things that they know well would be much better for success .however , other people who are eager for success usually think up new ideas and technologies in the modern world .consequently , only doing same things would become useless .to sum , people can not avoid to try new things and take riskes .to conclude , successful people try new things and realize new possibilities in many different situations .moreover , by taking risks , they gain chances of success .in the contrary , doing what people already know how to do well may become out of date .hence , it is not difficult to say that successful people try new thingl and take riskes rather than doing same things what they know .
