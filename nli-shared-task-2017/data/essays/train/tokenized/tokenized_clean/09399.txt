actually , it is not my belief that it is better for an educated person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in today s changing society , it is far from enough to be just an `` expert  .when we watch television or read newspaper , we think that to have an expert talking about a subject is reasonable or even that only the expert has the authority to talk about the subject in public .based on this psychological effect , we tend to support the idea that the society should produce more `` experts  , so that people will get more reliable information from the media and their lives .however , when it comes to education , it will be a bad idea for the students nowadays .for example , i ve always wanted to be an simultaneous interpreter .but being an interpreter requires a lot more than the knowledge about translating .he has to know `` something about everything , and everything about something  .if he has to go to a conference which is dicussing the oil crisis .he has to know the basic information about oil , all kinds of oil in fact .therefore , a successful professional should nt be limited in the arena of his specialized subject .otherwise , his success would nt last very long .for example , if you are an employee working for an insurance company .the basic rule for you to success is that you know how to sell .that is a skill that involves with a lot of other subjects .you d better know how the hospital works , so that you can sell your insurance to its patiences .then you need to know what kind of patients can make protential customers and what kind of patients can not ( like those who have developed uncurable disease ) .so , after years of studing in college , if you know nothing other than what insurance is , you are definitely doomed .so , in my opinion , being an `` expert  is not a bad thing , but what we really need in today s challenging world are people who have their specialization and also the broad knowledge about the nature and the society .
