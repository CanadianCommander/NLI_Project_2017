when things are going weel , does it mean that it might turn bad ?we usually say that what goes up , must go down , but is that a true statement ?when we are in a successful situation we have two possible ways to react .some people will keep doing what they already do while others will try new things and take risks .few peole who succeed will try to keep doing what they already know how to do well .that way , they will not put their life in a situation where they might loose everything .for example , somebody who learned how to fear the futur like an old entrepreneur will know when comes the time to slow down an activity in order to make it safer .only very rational and experienced people will be able to take that kind of decision .you need to know yourself very well to act like that .but successful people are usually in that situation because once in their life , they took a risk , they made a decision that made them successful .most of us will get excited by success .money and honors usually turn us into non rational people .successful people will take risks and try new things .it is true that successful people usually do nt take a step back to look at the situation .most of the time , they will take risks instead of trying to make there situation sustanable .but is that a bad thing ?life is short and we have to enjoy our lifetime .the better way to do it , is to take risks .our goals should be learning , meeting people , and discovering new things .to conclude , there is a very important cultural part in the way people would react .from my point of view , life is short and we should always go toward new things , that s how we can spend an efficient time on earth .the better way to go backward is to to try to stay in the same situation .
