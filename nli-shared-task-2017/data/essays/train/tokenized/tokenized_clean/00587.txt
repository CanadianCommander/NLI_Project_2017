people try new things and take risks and some people do the things which they already know .failures are stepping stones to success .some people take the risk and fails but they take it as an example .they learn the situations where they did mistakes .they examine the total process and they find the mistakes in that .in all situation it is not possible because if the person investing the money in a business if he got loss he become helpless .it is not possible to take risk in all situations it depends on the situation .risks are must for to invite the new things .right brothers failed in inventing the aeroplane for the first time but they didnot left it .atlast they invented the aeroplane .if people donot take the risk there is no new thing in this world .for some risks they last their lives also .behind the success there may be risk but risk is not the one which gives success .there are many people who are succeded without the risk .risk will not work in all the situations .people will take up the business which is already established and famous through this there is no problem for them .it gives more comfort for them .if the people take the risk there is the probability for their success .the risk taken by the people must be helpful for the mankind .people invite the explosives but they are helpful for the mankind .they destroy the countries .if the people invented the bombs also it is not the success .it is a big failure .people will be succeded if they older things also .if the already known work is in proper manner then it is much easier them to follow it and they become successful persons very easily .from this i can conclude that some people take risks and become successful persons and some people do the things which are already known .
