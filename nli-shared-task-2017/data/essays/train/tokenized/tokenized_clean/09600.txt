it is definitely important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts because facts are based on ideas and concepts .there always is some concept in the process to reach for a particular fact .so if a student is not clear in his/her ideas or concepts he will definitely have some problem in finding a particular fact about something .let us take an example .suppose that there is a student working on some physics paper .now he comes across a point of `` work  . and he notices that the formula for force is work = force * displacement( force multiplied by displacement )now if the student does not know anything about `` displacement  , i.e. whether a positive or a negative displacement , he will be confused .another important thing is that the `` facts and figures  , that we make use of while understanding the `` idea or concept  , are also based on some concepts .working on a concept with some facts leads to a new `` fact  .we sometimes take an example of newtons third law of motion in our everyday life .the law states that `` every action has an equal and opposite reaction  .suppose we hit the wall with our hand , it definitely hurts .the reason for this is that when we apply force on a body it reacts to it at the same moment the force is applied .we never wonder why we are hurt .this also has many reasons .first of ll the third law of motion prompts the wall to react back .secondly the density of the wall is more than our hand .because if we hit a bag of cotton with the same force it wont hurt here we have made use of facts and concepts both .we see that `` facts  and `` concepts  are interrelated but it is very important to understand the concepts and ideas before we try to learn or arrive at any fact .moreover if we dont understand any ideas or concept we just keep on working on the known facts .but if we concentrate on the concepts or ideas about a particular thing , it may be that we develop a new fact about it .
