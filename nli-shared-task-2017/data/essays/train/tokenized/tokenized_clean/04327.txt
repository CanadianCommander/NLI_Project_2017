i agree with the statement , i think that young people enjoy more the life that older people do .young people have a full live in front of their eyes and thay can do a lot of activities .they have less bad experiences than older people , therefore , they have less suffering .many of them do nt have to work , they do nt have to gain every day bread .even if they work , it s more like an adventure because it s their first job .most of them are single , therefore , they can make all their dreams come true .in the youth , time looks long .in that period , people have a lot of time in their lives .they usually do nt think in death and they can enjoy life .they have time to study or to spend time with their friends .they can make projects of many years and realize them .young people have less bad experiences than older people , this fact make the life of young people sweeter than older ones .usually young people have less motives to suffering .if they have a bad experience , they can forget about it because they do nt have a lot of bad memories .when people grow up , they start to have more problems .they have to work and pay taxes , later they have to maintain a family .in the youth , people do nt have to work , they have a lot of free time .they have the time to entertain with people of their age .when a person starts a job , it s exciting in the beginning because it s a new activity .the first job is always a great experience because it s the first step to adulthood .this is before the experience become repetitive , before a regular job of many years .in this period of their life , young people are usually single .they do nt have big responsabilities and they can make their future as they want .in summary , i think life is better in the youth .real problems begin after this .youth is the time to preparing for life , also it s the time to enjoy life .
