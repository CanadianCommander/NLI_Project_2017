i believe that successful people try new things and take more risks than other people .being successful means to built new ways .when we search about successful people lives we could see what made them successful is that they find new subject , creat something new , they found new ways , new styles etc .to continue what you know well does nt make you successfull but it can make you experinced .being experinced is a good and essential for doing a job but it can not built your ability to create something and change your life style or thinking style .when we look at some artists or scientists life we could see that they tried to live in a different way and change sometihng which they never lived before .so what makes people remember and artist because he different things and make a cange in people lives .why gandhi is well known figure in the world that he does nt want to live like all people live in his country and he made a decision and take a risk .the risk also can take his life from him but without taking any risk no matter can change .it is so politicial issue to discuss in this section but i want to mansion about only one thing if he never want to change his life and protest soldiers with a quiet way he can never show the people how successful politition he was .successful people have take risk to be successful , and being successful also needs new things to try and never give up .
