i completely agree with the statamenet that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .most of the advertisements describes their products as they are the best in the market , without any considerations to any side or bad effects in its use for any human or any specific group such as children or eldests .at the same hand , most of the advertisements consider the financial margin as the most proirity rather than other important factors that might affect the whole human health , such as ingridents used for specific products that might cause cancer , allirgey , and diabetes .in my own expereince , i used to have redbull ( an energy drink ) as my daily drink to empower and keep my self awake for as long as possible due to my long working hours shifts .two year later i read an article by chance followed with an internet research showed that all this type of drinks are a slower killers more than an energetic drinks !it has a ( stroptroin ) more than any thing else , and the research showed that more than one cup a day might cause to a heart attack and to a few cases of addiction to it .but what makes this red bull is the most famous energy drink , is the advertisements and campaigns all over the world showing its one side effect ( enegry ) hiding all other negative side effects that might cause our lives especially our youth !it is not a problem to have these products in hour hands , but the disaster is that we need the proper awareness that tells us what exactly it is about .we need to read and keep educating ourselves with these kinds of products , and to try as much as posible to select what is more suitable to our use and health .
