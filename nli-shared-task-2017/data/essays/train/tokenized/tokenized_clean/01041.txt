every day people are speaking about controversial topics like this .some think in twenty year is going to be a masive number of cars , more than today .however others think is going to be less .both of them have reason to support their ideas .on one hand , the reasons which support people who think that in twenty year is going to be more cars , they are based in the society , in the way that society is going on .each day we are most consumist people altough there are some against consumism and some organization that try to stop it .in fact young people is worried about to have a house and a car and to be comfy in life .the announce in televion , radio . ..are making cars publicity brecause car s company are not worry about people , the pollution , enviroment , roads , safe life . ..and they are only worried about money , to get more money each day , and this is the problem .they put in the mind of young people overall , feelings to consume .they want to have the best car , to get the best women and things like that .on the other hand the others believe on people .they think the mind of people is change because we have a lot of problems a cause of the cars such as people who is dying on the road , pollution , not enough petrol in the worl , wars a cause of petrol , and overall they believe in the tecnology , because new things are made instand cars , maybe diferent cars .there are many control in some citys ; the restrictions in some countries which for example some days if you have a red car you can not drive on monday .there are regulation , and rules like that for exaple in italy .maybe people is fed up of these rules and they decide to not have a car .also , they think that young people waste a lot of money and they are independence of parents later so maybe in the future there are less cars than now .in conclusion i short of feels that i agree with people who think that in twenty year is going to be a masive number of cars for the same reasons .finally this topic would remain in controversial .who is the true way we do nt know actually , but we ll see in twenty years .
