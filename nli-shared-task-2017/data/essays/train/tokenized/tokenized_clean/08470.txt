in the first place i am the kind of person who likes to know about different themes and academic subjects , but i think that is better to concentrate in one specific subject because you are not going to be able to have a deep knowledge in many subjects .i believe that is better to concentrate your knowledge .some people may think that is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects .this idea could be true but i am sure that less is more .for example if you are studying something realated with the arts like graphic design or filmmaking .in thouse fields of study you have a wide varaiety of subjects to study and learn , but then you have to choose and concentrate in one subject or theme .for example in filmmaking you can choose between different fields of study like producction design , direction of photography , editing , screenwriting or directing .even if you have a lot of subjects in common then you need to specialize in one subject .for example if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about different themes and subjects like painting , art , literature , lighting .but this does nt mean that you need to have a deep knowledge in all those things .those things are going to help you to understand about how things work but i believe that you do nt need to be able to handle the lighting for example .finally i think that life is to short to have broad knowledge in many things .i prefer to concentrate in the things i enjoy and know about them
