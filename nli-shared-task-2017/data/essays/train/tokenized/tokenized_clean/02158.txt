there are many options for the university student in their studies .someone can get deep in one topic and pay all his attention to this topic or ahve broad knowledge of many academic subjects .my opinion is the researches should focus on his study to get all the information about his topic , however he should also follow what is going on other subjects .the definition of the world master is someone who knows all the esential information about one topic .since it is difficult to reach all the knowledge about many topics , the reasercher should choose one specific topic and concentrate on it .in todays world , knowledge is like ocean .if a fish wants to see all part of the ocean , it will exactly lost his way .there are some examples of people who chosed many subjects to study and becomed succesful .for instance ; decards who is called as the father of geometry is know as one of the biggest philoshofers .newton who set the basis rules of the phisic , has a lot of theories that are used in the modern mathematics .however , the number of these scinetics are limited .many good scientis are concenrate on one topic .in the universites it is difficult to find a professor who gives lecture in two different departmant .however , the researcher should have the major knowledge from related subjects to his topic .for example , the electronical enginieer working on television research and development department should know what is going on in computer technology to carry out his research .to sum up , it is better to specialize in one specific subject while knowing what is going on aroud .
