it is generally believed that after twenty years , there will be fewer cars than today .although many people think that cars are getting more decreased , in my opinion , cars will be much more increased in twenty years .above all , nowdays people want to live more convenient .people would like to save their time and money .so they may be want to their own cars .for example , if they have their cars , they will save their time and they can go everywhere they want .cars will become most important things in people s lives .then the demands for buying the car will be increasing .for exampl , nowdays one house has more than one car .because they want to move individually , so they just get one s car .in this sense , people need cars imperatively to do live more conveniently in individualize society .in addition , recently our technologies have developed continuously .all over the world , they try to creat new and innovative things .then we can not stop their needs for making good and new things such as robots , machines and cars .some scientists try to spread out the car whcih makes no pollution or use natural resources .if we have that cars , we do not worry about the pollutions which can be bad effects about cars .people who do not want to pollute environment will be enjoy their lives with their cars which make no pollution .in this respect , if scientists study about the car which make no pollution and use natural resources and spread out all over the world , we will try to use the cars much more than use the public transportation .in conlusion , i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today for the reasons that i mentioned above .to live much more convenient life and the development of technology influence on the increasing the cars after twenty years .
