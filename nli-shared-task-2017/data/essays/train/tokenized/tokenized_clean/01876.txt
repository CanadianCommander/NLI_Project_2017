today s youth is a dynamic one , everything is instantaneous and at a rapid pace .as much as i agree with the amount of work load the people of today s generation have , i still feel that the young people nowadays are not doing enough for the betterment of their community .people especially young people complain about the problems faced by them in their cities such as traffic , corruption , crimes etc .but rarely is there a person among them who is ready to jump into the system and take steps in solving the problems .in my opinion if you do not have the capability to stand up and take the matter into your own hands , you should quit whining and live with what you have .the youth nowadays does not understantd its responsibility towards its community .they maintain a very laid back attitude , caring slightly about the problems faced by the community .it is the young people who should step up and take control of a problematic situation , as it is they who are brimming with energy , have fresh ideas and will be responsible for the future of their community .for e.g. in a country like india where the average age of a political leader is not less than sixty years corruption is rampant but none of the youngsters feel the need to join politics and improve the condition , they feel that joining politics would mean a waste of their academic degree .for today s youth helping the community is a very unimportant thing , for them their personal success comes first .they are very self-centered and selfish and would rarely waste their time and energy on a project for the betterment of the community .they seek personal advantage first hand .seldom after a natural disaster or calamity do we see the young people helping the affected people .it is always the older people helping themselves or the young school going children collecting funds .in such conditions it is the youth of the community that should step up and bring back the much needed stability .whereas instead of helping in disturbed conditions today s youth does not bat an eyelid about it .they feel it is a waste of their precious time .an ideal example of a responsible youth would be bhagat singh a revolutionary of india s freedom struggle who fought and even sacrificed his life for the freedom of his nation .i think that today s youth should follow in the steps of the great bhagat singh and realise their duties towards their community , and also take whatever steps necessary in improving their community .
