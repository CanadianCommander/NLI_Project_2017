i think that is impossible to simply answer to this question just saying yes or not .personally , i think that a deep understanding of ideas is strictly connected with the learning of the facts .i want to be clear : obviously i do not think that learning is a just a process of memorizing stuff like years , formulas , concepts or definitions .i think that a deepper understanding is necessary , but the latter is impossible without the former and viceversa .i will make an example , from my major field of study , that is philosophy of music : it is easy to imagine that learning facts is necessary to understand ideas .it is necessary to have a good knowledge about history facts about our musical history , like when a composer wrote a specific composition , when specific type of environment developed just to allow people to listen to music in silence , when composers start to use writing to preserve their works , how this symbolic system evolved during the centuries .when you have learned the facts , at this point it is possible for you to understand the main ideas .it will be usefull to examminee the understanding of the idea of authenticity in practice performance .it is important to know , for example , when a particular instrument started to be used by composer , in other words when it was invented , and how the performers red the scores in the baroque period to understand the idea of an authentic performance of this kind of music .if you do not know which was the original setting of a performance and how the performers played their instruments , how can you think about authenticity ?without a good historical grounding , something like a foundation in facts , your ideas will be completely arbitrary and your understanding just a lie .as wittgenstein said : `` let the facts speak for themselves  .this sentence does not mean that through facts when can discover the final truth , this is just for god , but we can say something of meaningfull , that could describe in a usefull way the world we live in .very often who considers learning facts just a stupid thing , a way to loose time , is someone not so good at school , that probably does not know the facts .holding that position probably he is trying to apologizing himself , because he does not no .it sounds like the story of the fox that could not get the fruit she wanted .she finally said : `` this fruit is not good to eat  .who consider learning facts as unusefull acts like the fox in the tale .
