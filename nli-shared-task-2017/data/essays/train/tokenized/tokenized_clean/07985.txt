many studies have shown that using of cars have a strong impact on environment pollution .however , it can be understood in our everyday life that the number of cars is rising .for example , some years ago it took fifteen minutes to reach my office while now it takes at least half an hour .even when we listen politicians speaking about how to work the problem of cars pollution out , noboby seems to take into consideration the possibility to reduce the number of cars .they rather seems to put much weight on alternative solutions , such as finding a new kind of essence or pushing people to use electric cars .personally , i do not believe that this situation will change in the future .first of all , using a car is easier and more comfortable that use public transports .people do not have to deal with timetables or bus stops .they can decide on their own when and where to leave .secondly , cities are becoming bigger and bigger .so , even if two persons have to go to the same city they need to have two cars .as a matter of fact , in milan , for example , it takes at least one hour to go from one part of the city to another .finally , people need to move to more distant places for working , studing or meeting their friends .it is less stresfull to use a car than take a train , then a bus and a taxi .in conclusion , i do not believe that the number of cars will decrease in the future .the only way to achieve that would be would be to forbid the using of cars .
