i agree with the statement because i think that spots make his products seems better almoust always .from the producters point of view it is a very good think because in this way they think that it is possibole for them to sell mach more products and so it s possible to make much more money .i think that this is not true in fact when someone goes to buy something because he sees that on tv or by some other kind of advertisiment , he mants to have that products with the propiety that were illustrated .if he comes back home with his new object and whene hi tries it and it notes tha the propiety are not seems as the advertisiment s ones , he is not sadisfaction at all .when happens something like that the client will never buy again the same products and he will never buy anything else by the same factory .for example : is chrismas , you want to buy to your son a new toy .you want to buy a small nice train that you saw on a tv spot .it has the railyway station and it is full of lights .the spot says that the lights turn really on .on the chrismas day you give your present to your little son and you say to him the the lights turn really on .he is vary happy for that but when he trys to turn on the light nothing happens .by now i m sure that you will never buy anything alse from the train s factory .for this reason i think that a producter have to make a real and true advertisements for his products , in this way people who buy something from him are sadisfy and so they maybe will come back to buy something alse from his factory .
