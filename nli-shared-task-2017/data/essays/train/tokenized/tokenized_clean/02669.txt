even though it is quite important for students to learn facts as well as ideas and concepts , i would like to insist on the importance to understand ideas and concepts before analyze facts because otherwise students can not keep right on truck .there are a couple of reasons why i emphasize for students to study ideas and concepts first .one is the fact that studying ideas and concepts first would work for students to learn facts efficiently .the other is the fact that learning fact does not make sense without a study from any perspective based on concrete ideas and concepts .first , if students understood ideas and concepts before learning facts , they could apply thier knowledge to focus on what the essence of the facts is and how those facts occur .this is one of the most important ability for students to learn in univerisity .they can not analyze any fact without fandamental ideas and concepts .for example , students can understand economic phenomena much more effectively with a number of concepts than without them .second , facts themselves do not make sense without any background infomation .if students did not study ideas and concepts at all , they would understand facts as just what happens at that time .however , they need study ideas and concepts to understand facts from different points of view .for example , when terrorists attacked buildings in new york , some people might say that it was totally isram s fault while the others say the united states is also contribute to this incident .in sumarry , students should understand ideas and concepts deeply before they learn and judge the facts .although it was not really easy for them to study ideas and concepts because sometimes those concepts are very complicated , they still do this because facts do not make sense without any basic ideas and concepts .
