i disagree with the presented statement .i think it is better to have an specific knowledge about an academic subject than having a wide range of academic knowledge .to underline my opinion i would like to refer some arguments and examples .first , i would like to refer my own experiences when i was studying law at university .there was a mass of students that started with me in my first semester .about 300 students had for several years the same courses , so we were all taught the same general subjects .there was no difference between the students , though the number of students was so high .is it possible that 300 people like to be taught in the same way ?this was something that disturbed me very much .in order to get rid of that academic unity i refused to listen to each lecture and started to read books on subjcts i was interessted in and got specialised by myself .second , you have to keep in mind that you need to get a job .i think most of the jobs are very specialised and you will need certain skills and knowlegde to get your work done .this is why you have to specify in one or two subjects before .then it would be to late for you to specialise .a as result you have to conclude , that it is better to specialise early in order to get a good job .third , of course i have to admit that there are so many things that are interessting to be dealt in class .in that general way it is granted that you also learn about things you were not interested in ( yet ) .perhaps you find out more about other subjects , that you did not get in contact with , because you were specialised .but neverless i would like to prefer to specialise myself and pay its tribute not to get into touch with other more general topics .i think when you are really interested in arts , music or anything else you can still read books about that or occupy in any other way yourself with general topics in your freetime .
