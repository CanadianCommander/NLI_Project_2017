in my opinion , i disagree with the idea in the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i d like to give several reasons belows .here is the list of reasons why i think so .one specific reason that comes readily to mind is that i am able to not only go anywhere with whomever i want to but also change the schedule of travel flexiblly by myself if i go to travel individually .in traveling to somewhere , i d rather want to go not only very popular place but also such a place where it is not so famous .for example , it happened when i went to germany with my family by not a tour .after traveling several days in germany , i went to a small church with my father in early morning .of course i also visit very famous place , for example the church of kelln , but at that time , i was so impressed by the beauty of that small church .it is one of the greatest experience for me during my stay in germany .like this , of course visiting famous place by a tour group is good , but i want to go to a place which is not presented by a tour guide .i think that tour group tend to visit only popular place .secoundly , i can be excited by planning a tour itself .when i travel to somewhere , i always take long hours for planning and organizing the schedule of trip .i d like to consider how i will go round , where i will go and so on .i can learn the geographic condition of a place or the weather pattern of a place by planning by myself .it s preferable for me .planning travel is very exiciting activity .if i went to a trip by a tour group , i would not be able to plan on any schedule because a tour guide must make overall plan .of course , i ca nt deny that there should exist some advantages in traveling by a tour group .if we travel by a tour group , we can receive detail explanation about some histrical heritage or cultural things .and we may go a place where we ca nt find by ourself because a tour guide is a proffesional and he or she must knows well about sightseeing spot than us .this idea may make an equally valid argument for the opposite position .but on careful consideration , i strongly believe that advantageas brought by traveling individually must exceed those by traveling by a tour group .considering all of the above factors , of course there are some advantages in traveling by a tour group , i find more advantages in making a trip individually .actually , i tend to change my schedule many times during my trip inherently , i think my nature does nt fit the trip by a tour group .trip that i can change the schedule flexiblly is far more fascinating for me .
