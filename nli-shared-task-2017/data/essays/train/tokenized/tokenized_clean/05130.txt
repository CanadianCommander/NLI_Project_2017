it is a well-known tradition for students to dislike dates .therefore , it seems that maybe they do nt like learning facts , which seems harder than `` just  understanding an idea or concept .indeed , once you have understood the idea of something , theorically , it remains in your mind , whereas facts are easily forgotten .you can then re use the concept you have learned before , only because you understood how it worked , why it was important , and so on .and , something very important for the students , if they do nt really remember the exact words their teacher used to explain the concept , they can made up something of their own , which may still be accurate .on the contrary , you can not do the same withs facts .facts , as it is implied , are precise , occurred in special situations , and were followed by special consequences .for example , you can explain to someone what is the concept of epicure s philosophy , even if you do nt really remember all the aspects of it , eventually your explanation may still be valuable for the other person .it is more complicated with facts ; indeed , you can not imagine how henry 8th left the catholic church to create the church of england , unless you know the facts , the dates , the consequences , and so on .as far as i am concerned , i think that facts are as important as concepts or ideas .facts are needed to understand concepts , and concepts are needed to foresee facts  consequences , for example .concepts may sometimes be too abstract for students , and the vocabulary generally used to explain a `` concept  is not really words that we use in everyday s life , and it may be a problem for some students .here , facts can help the teacher ( or the person explaining ) making the ideas clearer for the others .to conclude , i would say that there is a very close relationship between understanding ideas and learning facts ; none is more important than the other , and when you are sutdying , you need to do both to succeed .
