young people today do not think of others as much as they perhaps should , which has many different reasons , including biological , social , and historical reasons .the time period we are currently living in is a capitalistic era , and people in general , young or old , seek their own benifits in situation .children are being brought up to think with a capitalistic mind .it is important for parents that their children have a succesfull life .the definition of a such a life at the moment seems to be , wealth and prestige .these goals consume extreme amounts of time .this means that young adults are being brought up to think of themselves first , because they are being told a fullfilled life is having material goods .in consequence , these young people can not find the time in helping the community .at a young age , especially in the so-called `` teens ,  young people have alot of things on their mind , taking away any focus on aiding the community .during these years of transition between childhood and adultry hormones are swirling through the bodies of these people .they seek new things and try to explore what they do not know .there is also often a sence of loss during this period of time .these adolesensce try to find a reason to their existence , resulting in a search for identity .this proccess can be very overwhellming and often end negativly if not spend enough time on .this has often been the topic of literature .one example of this would be the novel `` catcher in the rye  by salinger .in that novel it enphasises the importance of teenagers to work on themselves and develope , to ensure a safe ending to their teenage years .helping the communities takes up time and energy , which few adolesensce can spare in this time of progression and search .the young people of today are a countermovement to the movement of their parents .every movement is followed by a countermovement .this can already be seen far back in history .and example would be the romanticiscm , which saw emotions and fantasy more important than logic and rational thinking .this was a countermovement to the period of enlightment which cherrished exactly that , what the romantic period dismaid , logic , and rational thinking .the young peple of today are going into the opposit directions their parents had gone .many of these parents were so-called `` hippies ,  which stood for love , piece , freedome , and helping eachother .if one would take the opposits of the traits in that movement , it would make the young people of today ; self-centered , ignorant , and often aggressive .this is very much what many young people of today are like .this way of thinking also excludes the mere thought about helping the communitie .young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is not solemly their fault , for they are a product of society and their natural instincs in specific time periods of their life .
