even though it is called the age of specialization , it is much better to have the broad knowledge of many subjects .i have heard some people saying that in the specialization age , as we called , it is not necessary to have all kinds of knowlege on many subject , because trying to equip all knowlege will make people busy and finally waste their time resulting in failure .an pastor i have known for several years , many times told me about this .he is energetic and active .he always tries to do his best in his field .but the result seems not to be very successful .one day he preached `` nowadays students have been so busy and tired of learing too many subjects which are not related to their major .because of this , they seem not to have their own specific knowledge that they can use for the benefit of this society .they have broad knowledge but not very useful for their success .this sounded ridiculous .whenever he has given sermons , he was very monotonous and made the saints bored and sleepy .nothing interesting .there were many kinds of people in the church and they had different background of their major .but he always used same and rutine article .suppose that you are listening same story almost everytime !who can endure it .when some christian gave him a question , he had no idea , even he could nt join other conversation with others .it was a fiasco .having universal and general knowledge on many academic subjects can help people have broad reationship and successful social life .and the enormous knoledge will support his specific field and lead to good success .
