nowadays people often speak about our society and the behaviour of our different generations .as a matter of fact by talking about these topics the question might come up to ur minde : whether young people really enjoy their life much more than older people do .to answer this question you have to look at several aspects that make me believe that older people have less fun in their life .as a great problem that has to be mentioned at this point is , that older people often get lazy and stick to their home and are kind of timid to leave home for a certain distance .they feel safe at home and know their enviroment .in order to this they try to get into as few situations as they can according to avoid new orientation or adaptation .or have you seen so many grand-parents going into a fun park or the cinema .another aspect might be that you can see many elderly walking around which give you the impression as if they feel not accepted or appropriate in the new started age .they feel too old .these are two behavioural problems of elderly which prevent them from enjoying their life as younger people do .additionally , although old people have got much freetime and nearly nothing to do , they do not get to the point to do more than the household .they always think that they have got a certain age and can not do this and that .another problem facing this is , that even younger people do not have the possiblity to encourage their grand-parents to keep on doing something .this fact might be due to a certain history of generations .older people are not allowed to enjoy life only to be kind of advisor for the younger generations .this is the way older people like to follow but younger people on the other side have not got in mind .as i pointed out in the paragraphes above , their are several problems which lead older people to the fact that they enjoy their life less than younger people do , when you try to mesure it on the activities people do .this is why i am of the opinion that older people mostly fale to enjoy their life , probably due to their own history that younger do nt have .due to this younger can enjoy life much better .
