i agree with the statement .but i do nt mean that young people are nowadays unkind but mean that they are looking at other place , not thier community .for example , many young people want to go overseas to help other people .it is a kind of trend among young people to participate in projects of npo or other group doing volunteer activity .in actual , i saw many times the advertisment of such kind of projects , tours or distributions .even though travel agencies offer those special tours that tie up with those activity group .so i can say that it s very very common and popular to help poor people or distructed green .but i do nt think they are really serious about the comunity around them .probably they do something for their commnunity , but will not give enough time to do that .there are two reason .the one is because of grobalization .we learn so many thing about other countries from many sources and some of young people can learn it directly .they could get to know the people in south africa sufferd and hungered .these knowledge is enough for them to participate in the tour for delively foods and comodities for the people in south africa .the another , is also related with that .everything of other country is very different from things that they have .food , custom and culture .these things are very interesting for young people , and it make them take to other countries .they can learn atractive and new things , and some of them are really abusoluted in things of other countries .compared with things gs other contries , things around them is less atractive .so that s why they are not very interested in their community .
