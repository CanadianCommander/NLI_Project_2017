old people enjoy life more than younger people do .i think age of people does not affect the enjoy that they can take from life in a negative way .the most important fact that affects the level of the enjoy they get from life is the characteristics of people .according to me , the enjoy depends on that the person is social or not .a young person who is not social may not enjoy from life as older people do .a social person at older ages can be a member of social clubs , attent to touristic journeys or join to social activities .however , unsocial young person can stay at home and do nothing except eating , drinking and sleeping which are only the basic activities of a human being can do .an advantage of old people possess in enjoying more than young people is the age .age can be thought as a limiting fact at first ; nevertheless , if we thought more we can realise that it is not .young people should work hard to earn their life in economic means and for their career .they should also spend their time with their families .in short , they have limited time for too much acivities or duties .in contrast , old people have no limiting time problems .they do not to think about their life , their work and their family , since their life is at a stable phase .on the otherhand , young people have a lot of stress source which decreases or limits the enjot they get from life .moreover , their economic status maybe better than the young people .they can have enough money to spend in social activities .another advantage of old people for enjoying life more can be experience .as they live more than young people , they can easily find anything to enjoy .for instance , they can go to a holiday instead of palying card games with their friends .however , one can say that there are several disadvantages for old people to enjoy from life .health and old ages are inhibiting agents of enjoying life .old people can have sicknesses more than younger people .in addition , old ages can restrict them to do certain activities like sport activities .nevertheless , an old but social person can find alternative activities according to his or her age .in conclusion , i believe that the age of a people does not defines the level of enjoy that they can get from life .furthermore , old ages can provide more opportunity to people to enjoy more from life .
