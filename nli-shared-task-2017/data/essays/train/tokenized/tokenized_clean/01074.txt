some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .however , where i live , older people are very healthy and acitive than they used to .in my opinion , older people enjoy more life than younger people do .the first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their couterparts , they can do a lot of activities they want to .for example , my parents are both retired .they have a lot of free time than i have .in addition , they worked for more than 35 years , so they have a large amount of money they can spend .that s why they travel almost once a month across my country and they have already visited all the prefectuers in my country .on the contrary , i have to work every day and i have less available time and money since i got a job last year .i was not able to go somewhere even in summer vacation .another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures , compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people , which leads to the young people s negative ideas about their lives in general .one illustration that makes this clear is that most of the young people concerns about their pensions they will receive in the future .now that the aging society in my country is getting serious , young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement .therefore , most of them have to save money for their future lives and they can not afford to enjoy their present lives .my consideration with respect to the available time and money as well as the negative ideas about future lives , i think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
