for the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  , in the question i strongly agree the statement .i agree this because of some many reasons .firstly a success can not be done with out taking risks and there is a proverb `` no pains no gains  .i agree , successful people try new thing and take risks , because there is no communication between the people who were far if graham bell not invented the telephone .the reason is basically graham bell is a engineer in electrical and have some knowledge of electromagnetic waves .graham bell worked a lot and took risks for inventing this telephone apart from is electrical knowledge .the second reason i agree this statement is because computer is invented my charles babbage who is succesful person .for inventing this computer charles took so many risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .charles babbage firstly invented a big computer called super computer .it occupies very large area and requires a lot of electrical power .but after working hard and taking so many risks he invented a small computer called personal computer , which we are using daily .this computer occupies less area and requires less amout of electrical power .this shows that always a successful person works for new thing taking risks .finally agree , this statement from own experience .when i was in tenth standard my mathematics teacher given me a problem which is easy to solve and i solved it .in the next hour he given me a difficult problem which is based on previous problem .he asked me do on the board and i solved it .but when teacher asked my classmate to do same problem on the board .he is not able to do on the board because he copied first problem from me .in conclusion , considering above example i strongly state that succesful people try new things and take risks
