i agree to the statement that most of the advertisements make their produts look more better than they really are .i agree this from my personnal experience , it has happened with me all the time .when i see some advertise in television , news paper or a magazine , it looks appealing to me but it gives me nothing but disappointment .advertisers attract common peopel by using famous people , stars and attractive models to sale their products .recently i saw one advertise in a magazine about one kitchen appliance which can cut and grind all the fruits and vegetables with ease and in all the shapes and size you need .looking at the advertise and the way they had presented it felt like all my problems wil get solved by getting it at home .the very same day i got it and it proved to be a desaster , it could nt do a single thing that was shown .marketers attract people by showing all the good things which a person could imagine without judging its truth .many people do get fooled because of the advertisement .even produsers and distributers of movie try to sale their products by showing trailers in a manner that everybody feels that this movie is the biggest hit of the year and it is watchable .but many a times we come out without being entertained .advertisers are those who put a attractive gift wraper on the real product .they cover up faults and present it in a glamourous way which compels people to go for it .
