in classes , students learn not only the facts but also the `` ideas  or `` concepts  that can be pulled out from the fact .i strongly agree the statement that it is more improtant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , diffrent from learning only facts , if we understand ideas and concepts throughly , we can apply the knowledge to our life .for example , if we only know the fact that franklin d. roosevelt built new deal in history , it s just the fact as it is .but if we understand how and why franklin d. roosevelt built new deal policy and how it effected to american reneissance , we can apply to our life as we change ourselves as roosevelt changed his country step by step in history .we can be impressed and motivated by understanding details about fdr s new deals and accepted him as american hero .like the exampels , learning the fact is not enough to challenge ourselves .we have to throughly understand what ideas or concepts the text book provides .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will create a new fact that can be the great resources for the future .we have to learn from history , and prepare for future .if one have ideas and concepts from history , it can be reformed to more innovative ideas and concepts .for example , lots of designers read many articles and magazines and see pictures from design book and try to immitate it .if they stop trying in the moment they just saw other designer s ideas , the design will stay as it is now .but from the past design , designers rethink about it and create a novel complete ideas from it .this is how the design was developed and will be developed in the future .as i indicate in a example of design , understanding the a idea or concept is the first step to remodel and develop this world .we have to accept the ideas or concepts from resourses the world has now , and recreate it with more imagination and sophistication .because of this two reason , i belive understainding ideas and concepts is much more important than just knowing facts from text .to develop oursevles and the world , we have to pay attention more to `` ideas  and `` concepts  rather than facts .
