the scince world has no limits .every day we explore some new things in this world .the human mind and the ability to imagin and to creat have no limits .so that i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts , because of several reason like , they may add some new ideas to it , they may explore that the ftacts that we have are wrong , they can leran more about the subject if look by theirself .first , when the student understnad the idea he may add some new ideas to it .adding new information can come only if the student start to think in the problem the without knowing that there were some people before him thought about it .if the student did not know about the facts , he maybe invent some new ideas that can be write .second , the student can shows that the facts that we have now are wrong .many times in the past some beginners people shows that the facts that they had were wrong .the facts that we have now were made by a humanes and every humane can do some mistakes .the people who made this fact were in some parts of their lives students like us now , so there is no differents betwen us and the people who made taht facts .third , if the student start to leran about the subject by his own , he will learn much better more than just leran the facts .ignoring the facts can be very helpful for the student because he will start to think using his mind not the facts .using the facts is killing the ability to creat a new facts , because the student is going to use the facts without think if they were right or not .finally , according to i wrote above , i belive that understanding the ideas is more important for the student than it is for them fo learn facts .it is really helpful for the student because i tried it once and it really wroks .
