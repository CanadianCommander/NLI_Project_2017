i often watch advertisements on tv commercials or magazines .when i watch these advertisements , i always think that these advertisements are too much performance .the reasons that i think such thing is that i have experiences that there are big difference between advertisements and real one .therefore i agree with this statement .first of all , i watch advertisements on tv everyday .actually that advertisements are attracted me .and then i have experienced that i boght degital camera on tv shopping program .however when i got this camera , i was really disappointed it .because the camera was nt good .on the tv shopping program , i thought that the camera was good .however , after getting it , i realized that that salesperson on the tv program explaned it too much .the person on the tv said that it is easy to use this camera , in fact i thought that this camera s operation was so complicated .in addition , when i worked for a bank , we were selling some stocks .and then our bank was using advertisements on tv .that advertisements said only good aspects .however not only me but also my coworkers thoght that that stocks have also risks .i thought that our advertisments should announce about high risk and high return , and i thought that some costomers must be misunderstand about this investment .in fact some customers who watched our advertisements on tv misunderstood .they did nt know risks on this investments .i have bad experiences about advertisements , when i was customer , in addtion , i felt that our bank s advertisements where i was working for was much better than real one .i understand that advertisements are strategy of sale .however i really think that it should nt do too much performances .because many customers might misunderstand .however , in fact there are many too much performances advertisements in the world .therfore i agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
