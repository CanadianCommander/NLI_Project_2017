now adays advertisement is the best way to sell the products .the companies are taking the advantage of the advertisement , beacause advertisement shows the product more fancier than they really are .i totally agree with this statement .advertisement make product more better by showing its good qualities , size and comfortibility .first , advertisement only shows the good qualities of the product .it attracts the consumers to buy that product .every one like tobuy good products in the market , because good products are duable .second , advertisement make product look in better size .now people like to buy small things like i-pods , digital camaras etc .in the advertisement these things look cute and small , which attract people to buy them .if yiu go to store and look at the same things which were advertise are not has the same look as adevertise by media .finally , advertisement shows that products are vary comfortable in use , but it ends up in not very comfortable in real .people get fooled by the advertisement .in conclusion , i like to say that most of the time people get fooled by the advertisement and buy the product , which are not as ggod as they look in advertisement .
