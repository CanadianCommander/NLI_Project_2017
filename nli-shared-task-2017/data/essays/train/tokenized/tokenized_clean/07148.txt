it is now the year 2006 .when today is compared with 20 years ago , it is easily seen that things have changed a lot .nothing remained the same but technology changed more than anything else .when car was first invented , a developed countries president made a comment about the cars .he said that it was an unnecessary invention and people would not like travelling in it .they would surely be bored of driving it one day and would return back to the horses they were riding before .but his comment never come true .it is clear that he does not like inventions but most people like .since technology is getting more advanced day by day , it is not hard to guess that something that will be more useful than the cars will be invented soon .maybe in 20 years people will not be driving cars .i strongly believe that in 20 years a mixture of a plane and car will be produced .so people will not drive on the earth anymore .this new invention will be good for everyone .since there will be no cars on the earth , there will be no traffic jam and since our `` plane-cars  will be in the sky there wo nt be any accidents because there will be plenty of emptiness in the sky .also this invention will be closer to the sun .so it will work with sun energy .as you see there will be no need of gasoline .people will not have to have a budget for gasoline because their car will work with only sunlight and it will be free !also if it is night and there is no sun , it will work with moon light .the idea of a `` plane-car  is just a dream for now but it sounds good .maybe it looks like a real fantasy , which is impossible to occur but we should keep in mind that some time ago many technological devices that we use now looked impossible , too .
