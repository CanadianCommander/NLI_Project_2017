it may looks like it to many people , but i disagee with this .i think in old days , things that should be done had been visible .it was need to be done with physicall labor .now , physical labor is less needed by using machines and computers .young people nowadays just do nt have idea what is really needed .where their hearts are , where their treasure is .old days , society was composed by big families .everybody is helping everybody .you know who you are helping , because they are their family members , relatives , or everyday neighbors who is even more close to your real relatives .but in modren socity with nuclear families people do nt know really about their neighbors .in this situation , getting help from other people sometimes considered as personal shame for some of us .as society is more and more materialized .we tend to judge other people by what they have , rather than what he/she really is .we should teach our young people about real values .we should open our eyes on emotional and spritual world .so that their values are not to have something more for them selves , but for others .let  them have chance .
