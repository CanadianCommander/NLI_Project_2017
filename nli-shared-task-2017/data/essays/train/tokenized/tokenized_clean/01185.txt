some people think that yonug people can act more than older people , and yong people can spent more enjoyable time than older people .for the following reasons , however , i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .first , older people have more free time .for example , older people can retire his job when the people got enough money to spent their least life .many older people can spent both money and time for what they want to do .some older people can travel all over the world .some people can gather antique jewelies all over the world .some people spend his life treating their gearden .by contrast , young people have to go school .yong people do not have enough time and money to do all what they want .second , older people have a great deal of knowledge and experience to spent time .for example , older people can enjoy even in five minutes , if they know writting poem .when the older people does not know about writing poem , they would hit on other ideas , ssuch as reading books , talking with others , and thinking about their offsprings  future .they know various choices , because they have experienced various past time in their own past .but , young people does nt .this is adventage for older people .so , i strongly disagree that older people enjoy their life less than young people .
