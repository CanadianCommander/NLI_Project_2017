i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first of all , because to tralve in a group is usually organized by some touring company that designs a guide , one can save time and energy for searching flight tickets , reserving rooms in hotels , etc , in particularly on one s busy working schedule .in addition , one may not familiar with the areas one is going to visit .it is easy to get the information from the guide .this is beneficial to know something about places one want to see in advance , which makes one get more impression and enhance memory .moreover , while traveling , the guides will provide introduction on what one is going to view , for example natual scenics or historic buildings .they should know more that travelers .by doing so , one can increase knowledge and avoid the situation in which one does not know anything but just look .finally , to tralve in a group provides one the opportunity to make more freinds .people travel together , live in the some hotel , have the same schecules in activities , which makes people in the group contact each other all the time along traveling .our family likes to travel on weekensd or in holidays .we perefer to take travel in a group .in this way , we can easily get tickets from traveling companies on heavy traffic days .the tour guide is available to give us more information we do nt know before , which argment our knowledge from travel , especially for our children .and also , we established freindship with other travelers , whom we still touch now .thus , traveling in a group is the best way .
