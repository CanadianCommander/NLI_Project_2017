while i was in school i was very unhappy when its time to learn the fact and memorize them because i was having more fun when trying to understand the ideas and concepts .i still believe on the same way .i think that trying to understand ideas makes you think on it more and you learn easier .in an other way the things you have learned keep in your mind in a longer period of time when you try to understand the idea or concept .when you just try to memorize the facts and do not pay attentinon to the understand its concept i think its like being a car engineer who never seen a car .a car engineer can know any technical detail about a car s mechanic but if he had never seen a car he would not understand the what it is for and how it is working .i had two different history teahers in high school , the one i had in second class was always want us to memorize and learn the facts .the history teacher i had in third class wants us just to understand the ideas , like why the wars begin istead of when did a specific war begin .i still remember the things i had learned in 3rd class but still have nothing in mind from the facts that i had memorised during second class .as a conclusion , the reason that trying to understant the ideas instead of learing the facts makes you think more and help you to understand more , i think it is more important for me and most of the students to try to understand it .in addition the thing you understand stay in your mind longer .
