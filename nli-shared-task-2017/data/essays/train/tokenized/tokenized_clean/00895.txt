the statement at hand expresses a strongly generalized opinion on a nowadays very fervent issue .it states that young people are disinclined to get involved in their communities .one must pay special attention to the fact that the statement only concerns a particular group in society , which is defined by age , and disregards any other group .at first , i want to point out my personal opinion : i do completely agree with the statement at hand .but for generalization reasons , one must explain why young people behave the way they do .to utterly comprehend the everyday life of young people and the prodigious amount of stress and challenges a young person faces today , one must view the world through the eyes of a young person :one might assume that academic achievement and the fulfillment of the need for social interaction are the only two major challenges youth is facing nowadays .this is , however , slightly superficial .the competition in times of economic hardship and rising unemployment is tough .in order to maintain the hope of being able to compete against lots of applicants for all sorts of institutions , one must maintain excellent grades .this is putting the current generation under severe pressure .moreover , there is a growing gap between the individual and his/her parents .the relationship with one s family is increasingly troubled , which leads to a loss of love and personal support .friends have to compensate for this .the world of today is fast-moving and seldom is there a moment to settle down comfortably .youth has to overcome obstacles which range from suffering support by one s family to drugs and loss of orientation .youth faces much .consequently , helping one s community is not a thing most young people pay particular attention to , because they are overly concerned with much more `` important  issues .
