i agree with the idea that is better to develop knowlegde in several subjects instead of specializing in one only .the first reason to believe it is related to the impact of knowledge on the individual .an extensive knowledge of a single subject confines a human being to its academic subject and does nt evolve its personality at large .on the contrary , the study of several subjects expands the limits of a person s undestanding of life as a whole .a second reason , focusing on the scholarly impacts of knowledge diversification , is that it offers the opportunity of a comparative approach .an academic who is educated in several different subjects will be able to identify interesting connections between distant disciplines , thus opening the way to new approaches .this is true not only for the academic world .any person who expnds her/his areas of knowledge increases her/his possibility to be successful in life .a third reason to prefer diversificationi is that it can prevent interest from drying up .when a person concentrates for a long period on a single subject , he/she is exposed to the risk of losing dedication or flatly identifying with a specific point of view .dealing with different subjects , instead , generates a relativistic approach that helps creativity and encourages new points of view .a clear example of how culture can positively expand in a single human being is offered by some renassaince intellectuals .a man like leonardo da vinci , for example , could with its knowledge embrace almost any subject known of the time .even if in the present days  reality such cases are not possible anymore because of the incommensurate expansion of human studies , the case of leonardo still represent a valid example of how a multidisciplinary approach to knowledge can boost human brain power .in conclusion , even if a few men can aspire to reach the erudition of leonardo , the arguments above effectively clarify how divesrification of knowledge can benefit intellectual work .
