the most fearful thing that people think is a death .then , some people may say that young people have a lot of time to live comparing to older people , therefore they can enjoy life more .it is sure that older people have high possibility of death because of various reasons , such as disease and weakness of their body .however , when the death comes are unknown .probabyly , a baby which is just born one hours ago may be die because of the sudden accident .therefore i disagree with the statement which is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .first , each people have a different situation and environment .these situation and environment have a great impact on a person s life .for example a lot of children dies because of disease or lack of foods in developing countries .their lives are quite hard .they do not know if they can live tomorrow or not , because they do not have any money and food .they also have to work for their family at the young age , and sometimes , they sell their organs to get money .young people are healthier than older people , therefore they have to earn money .probably , most of young people in these situation can not enjoy their life .therefore it is not true that all young people enjoy life and be able to spend their all time for themelves .second , older people in developed countries may have a lot of free time which they can use for their own .for example , in japan , a lot of older people can get money from the government after the decided age .therefore they do not have to work , and they use these free period to do their hobbies , such as sports , music , games . ..and so on .it is not true that all the old peple enjoy their lives , but it is true that a lot of old people enjoy their lives by arranging their future .although their death may be comming soon , they can enjoy their lives .as you read , if the person can enjoy the life or not is not depend on their age , but their situation , environment , people around him / her ...and so on .by changing their situation and way of thinking , people can enjoy their lives .
