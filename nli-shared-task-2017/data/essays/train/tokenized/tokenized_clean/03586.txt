cars were a wealthy sign twenty years ago .only , those who roll in money and live in good conditions of living could buy a car .in today s society , in western countries , the majority of the population have a car .we can wonder if the increase of the purchasing power have increased the number of cars for the last year and if this increase of cars is a reality or just an illusion .to my mind , it is true that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the fisrt reason of this incresing of car is the increase of the purchasing power .twenty years ago , in western countrie , there were clearily two socila classes ; the haves and the have not .so , the upper class outnumbered the wealthier .cars were considered as a luxious good .nervertheless , for few years , the middle class has represented the majority of the western population .at the same time , cars have been developing and their price reduced .as a consequence , with the emergence of the middle class and the decrease of few cars  prices , several persons could buy a car .the second reason is the development of the mobility .in fact , in today s society , a lot of people have to take a car to go working every day .commuters are more numerous and they need a car to work .furthemore , many firms need that their employees work in many cities and not on the head of office .what is more , we can see every day that there are more cars today .in fact , every evenings and every mornig , we can see on the roads many traffic jams at rush hours .we can wonder if the increase of these traffic jams , that we can check every year , will not dilusionned many persons to take cars .to conclude , we can notice that in spite of the development of trains and planes , the increase of cars is growing up .
