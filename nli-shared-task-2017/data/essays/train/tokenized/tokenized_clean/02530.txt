a broad knowledge of many different subjects give you the ability to face much more situations , understand them and how they inceract , makes you more flexible and gives you a more complete view of the world urrounding .a specific knowledge allows you to interact in the best way possible with one subject , but your scope is limited to it .personally i prefer to have a broad knowledge , because the world is nt a serie of sealed rooms , so the ability to deal with more than one situation is vital .a too specialized competence laks in the whole-view , fourthermore it holds you in only one context .
