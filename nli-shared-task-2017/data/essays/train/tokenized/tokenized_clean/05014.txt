change is an integral of life .things keep changing around us almost all the time on itself .but at times it becomes neccessary for a person to induce a change .a thing which is absolutely new and could be dangerous .what is the fun in leading a life when there is no challenge to be faced no risk to overcome ?i completely agree that new things should be incorporated and risk taken rather than dwelling on the things that a person is adept at .firstly , it makes the person all the more competitive which is very essential to survive in this earth .if he does the same thing that he is adroit at , may be he is right on his part .but actually he is missing on the myriad opportunities that a new issue can provide him with .survival of the fittest  a pithy that is so true .if the person has to survive he should do new things and take a few risks in order to achieve the zenith .further , by trying new ventures the person has the opportunity to recognise his other skills which were untouched for so long .to become successful it is very essential to recognise personal strengths and vulnerabilities .this is the stepping stone for success .may be they founder intially but at the end the hard and smart work gets him across the hurdle .moreover , by trying hand at different things a person gains a lot of experience and this can be utilised in his present or future ventures .life becomes very monotonous if just one task is repeated all through the life .by trying new things a person can actually make his life more colourful and intresting .by continuing the same task it is just like a frog whose world ends at the limit of his pond .but successful people look globally .a successful person never falters to accept a challenge and this is the hallmark of successful people .by hitting at something new it is indeed a challenge which the person through his diligent work , overcomes .to conclude i must say that a risk is there in every action of the entire mankind .it is this strength to counteract this risk and emerge truimphant that makes a man successful .
