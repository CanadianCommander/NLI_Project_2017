currently , the controvesial issure of to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject urges great attention among the public and individuals .as far as i concerned , it is much intricate to draw a sweep generalized conclusion .with the diversity of the society , the demands for the diverse human resouce is required as well , meanwhile it depends on the stage and the position the person holds .from a undergraduated student s perspective , it is obviously better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjuct .since not only will a broader academic knowledge area bring to wider the students  thoughts , but will help them to study their major better .variety of academic knowledge ask people to have strong logic to view the issue , so it will help the students to view their major from different perspective .moreover , it will provide students with a chance to find out the specific subject they desire to futher .however , for a graduated student , it is vital to be specialized .a graduated student , who is going to face the challenge of development and research in his / her major area , should have specilized knowledge structure to be responsible for the improvement of the society .at this extent , general conprehensiviation of knowledge is rather than adiquent .on the other hand , for a maneger or someone who may be high than this level , should not only be specialized in their subject but also have to have broad knowledg of many subjects .the people at this level should be more prudent in every decision they make , so they have to consider every aspect carefully before they make the decisions .as so , quiet a lot aspects require quiet a broader knowledge areas .different people have knowledge for different intention ; different intentions give them different motivations ; different motivations bring them different interests and profits .it is impossible to cover all actors as a whole in this issure , however , as for me , a undergraduated student , to learn as many subject as i can to find the most appealing area and to understand my major knowledge futher will be my option . .
