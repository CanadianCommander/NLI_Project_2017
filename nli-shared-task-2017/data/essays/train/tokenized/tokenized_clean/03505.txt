i am a business guy .so i take risks .in my opinion , everybody has to take risk in their lifes .but risk is risk .so you can not make sure if you take it , it is going to be good for you or not .no body can know that .i can give an example about my uncle who was one of famuous importer in my country , which is turkey .as i said , he was a big importer and he was bringing fruits from other countries such as , usa , peru , chili etc .he had been in that job for about 10 years before he decided to change his goods what he was bringing .actually he did nt change basicly .but he started to bring more tropycal fruits such as ; pineapples , kiwi etc. rather then the others . .but he had not thought that if you want to change something in company you have to think all changing .for example of his company is that company had to buy new vehicles for carriying fruits .because those new fruits more sensetive then he used to bring .it is a big problem for company cause of these vehicles are expensive .beside that , they did not have any experiences about new fruits .they did not know how do they have to do keep them or how long they can keep .some more problems and then everything was going bad .i am not telling do not take risks .if i was he , i would do that as he did .but if we want to do thing , we should think about everything .i love this phares  the only thing not change is changing  .so we need to change something and while we change , we have to take risks , whatever i am in future i will always take risks .because i believe in that taking risks is the most importent thing in life .
