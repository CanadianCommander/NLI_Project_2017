many people are convinced , that the last universal genius died with humboldt , or even earlier with other great scientists , philosophers and thinkers .that would mean , that today every academic field is only teaching a specified knowledge .i cantt share this opinion .as a student of political science , i consider myself as a person that is accumulating knowledge in various academic subjects , not only in one specified .so an answer to this question , the old question of `` generalization  against `` specification  . is not really difficult to me .the most important argument in this context is large range of possibilities of where you will work in future .people that study only a specific subjectonly have few varieties of what to do in future .but on the other hand they are the one with the , i think , better chances to get a job anyway .it is so to say a risk to persue the path of generalization  in job perspectives .but having a broad academic background makes it much more easier to handle a problem , because you will be able to make use of very different problem solving strategies , which only specific knowledge , this wo nt be that easy .but not only in carreer issues , generalization is more comprehensive .experiencing already at university ( by studying a broad variety of subjects ) that life is much more than what you think it is , is a great addition to life quality .i m thinking of a person that is sophisticated , with good manners and that is interested in the world and the people living in it and especially in those living close around him .to come to a conclusion , generalization could play an important part in creating a better world .
