some people might say that having a broad knowledge is more important than focusing on one specific subject ; this discussion has been a subject of dispute for some time .however , this argument is asserted as a general rule and omits some important concerns that must be addressed in order to substantiate this argument .most conspicuously , the professional life utterly requires you to be proficient in one subject .for instance , knowing accounting standards will not be immensely useful if you are working as a nurse .moreover , students are likely to decide a major when they leave high shools .as an illustration , it is worth having a specific skill in order to make this choice much easier .focusing on a particular subject may therefore be more effective for students .however , it could be argued that a wide knowledge is sometimes more important that focusing on a particular subject .for example , when a worker is made redundant , having a wide range of skills may sometimes be far more efficient in order to find a new job ; this seems to be even more important for people who do not have any degree .likewise , the personal life often requires you to have broad skills .for example , borrowing money , looking after children , repairing a car are situations which require some basic skills in order to be effective .in conclusion , this argument leaves out some key issues even if we may infer that it is a delicate subject .it can sometimes be more important to have a broad knowledge , but it could be also asserted that in some cases , it proves most useful to be more proficient in one specific subject .therefore , it depends upon what kind of skills you require .
