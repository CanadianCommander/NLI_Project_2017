i agree with the given statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .the possible reason for this kind of behaviour could be lack of concern for their communities .young people are more enthusiastic and are more busy with their daily lives .most of the times , as they argue , they do not have time for such activites .but this assumption is appears to be false .they can definitely devote time for this cause .it entirely depends on their disposition .by devoting even an hour for the improvement of the community they can help the community a lot .the younger generation thinks that the community is meant for adults and they are the ones who should work for it .but they are mistaken .they do not know that how their help may be beneficial to others .the younger generation considers playing games , hanging out with friends and going to parties more important than their participation in the activities of the community .they consider the community activities monotonous and mundane .they prefer , say , going to a movie or playing basketball over serving to community .they believe that they can have a lot more fun rather than being stuck up in working for the community .they do not realize how important it is to help their neighbours and all they people associated with the community .perhaps , a possible reason for their reluctance may be lack of knowledge of pros and cons of having a community .adults , on the other hand , have more concern for their communities .they know its importance more than the young people do .they are the ones who can inspire the young people by telling them the importance of these communities , their advantages and disadvantages .if every youngster devotes even an hour to serving the community , they can help a lot .
