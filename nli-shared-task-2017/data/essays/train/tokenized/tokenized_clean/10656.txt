i totally agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .in our life , we have a lots of chances to face to the delimma situations .sometime we will follow the indicatation by people who have the same experience and know the best answer .however , sometime we just take a chance even we know it might have some risks .in my opinion , i support that we should take chance in trying new thinds .first and foremost , everyday we will meet numerous of new things .if we always just fellowed the rules that were given by others , we would miss a lots of chance to learn things by ourselves .for example , when i was child , i always copy the essay from my sister , because i know she always get high grade than me .but after i grew up , i try to write by myself , to my astonished , i found that writting is a such interesting thing .moreover , i can learn new vocabulary and skills from writting .if i did not do it by myself , i would never find the fun of writting .second , we will never know the result , it might be good or be bad .it is life , is not it ?it is more impressed if the results is came from ourselves .we can learn from the bad result and never do it again .also remember the good results in mind , next time when we meet the same situation , we know the answer .futhermore , after trying new things and getting good result , the feeling of satisfy is the most wonderful feeling in the world , everytime i make a right dicision , i will very proud by myself and talk to everybody to share my joy .even some of my friends wil be encouraged .in conclusion , i think take chance when trying new things carry more weight than doing what they already know how to do .
