as far as iam concerned , i agree this statement .because understanding ideas and concepts are the basic steps to know more about facts .however facts also having some importance for students .following are the reasons to support my choice .firstly , understanding ideas gives a basic step to think about the object .if you understand clearly then its easy to estimate the quality and theory of that object .hence we need a extra concentration on understanding ideas and concepts .mostly every fact will have its own concept and idea .inaddition , if students concentrate well on understading ideas and concepts they can easily recognize the fact .some research studies indicates that students who having more concept will show highly recognizing nature than others .for example will give mutch impotance to understanding ideas and facts , i really got sound knowledge in subject .also i can easily estimate the fact in a subject .futhermore , lot of the students will give mutch importance to concepts , because if you learn concepts it will take long time to forget .by showing extra concentration on ideas and facts lot of students were written well on exams .most of the lectures will also give importance to concept because once a student learned concept very well than its easy to teach them .however there is a need to understand facts , these are the conclusion to most ideas and concepts .several researchers saying that if a student having capability to recognize the fact than he is very sound in perticular subject .as far as iam concerned , ideas and concepts can play a major role in determinig facts .i can strongly support that ideas and facts are more important to students than facts .lot of researchers are also saying tha same .by based on above reasons and supporting points i can safely conclude that conceprt is more important than facts for students .
