less than 100 years ago , people could only expect to live up to 40 or 50 years of age , or even less .but today , many elders reache 100 years or over .researchers show that life expectancy increases continuously .older people live older and many scientist believe it is a direct response to how they enjoy life .personnaly , i strongly support the fact that older people have a full life that is equal to the yonger people , and for many reasons .mainly , the improvement of infrastructure in society help older people to participate in many activites .as well , the adaptation of these activities to the elderly increases their participation .more people of old age composes the society of today .this clearly emphasies the need for activities specifically targeted at older people .but how can they participate if they can not attend them .city counsil are modifying their infrastructures to address this .they created bus services for them and provided them with people to accompany them in their activites .it resulted in an increase of participation , and elderly people like it .this certainly shows that they can enjoy life as much as other age groups do .but these activites also need adaptation .initially , the type of activities available tended to be more focused on the yonger crowds , and this for many reasons .yonger people were more `` seen  around the city and were definitely more active .these two features created the illusion that they enjoy more life .but older people can also enjoy activities and it has an important impact on their longevity .the increase of life expectancy is a clear example of it .the city created activities just for the elderly , such as dances and dinner where they can meet together , share their memories , and enjoy themselves .these new meetings definitely provided more reasons to life better and fuller for them .to prove the point further , societies have also introduced programs of activities where both young and old people can participate together .i participated in a program in my city where i accompanied one or two elders to shows or activites specialy designed for them .i immensly enjoyed when they share their experience with me .it help me understand life better and enjoy my life .i bring them a flavor of youth that make them forget other problems they are facing .so we both enjoy life together .to conlude , i believe that any people , no matter their age , can enjoy life to its fulless .to do so , societies need to provide adapted activites to the different age groups .this can be done by modifying the infrastructures and creating specific activies .young people as well as older people will benefit from it equally , and will even participate together and help each other to improve their way of life .
