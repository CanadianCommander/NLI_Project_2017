i m of the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .firstly , the activities most of the youngsters do are chatting on phones , surfing information , hanging out with friends , going out for movies , restaurants and the list goes on .they do not even give enough time for their studies too .the activities they do will not fetch them anything worthful .their psychology can be understood easily .all of them think in the same way .they like to play games and want to enjoy their teenage life by not taking any responsibilities .instead of spending time on watching movies one can utilise the same for a good cause .students in primary schools are made to participate in such programs so that they will follow the same later on .for example many of the schools in my city participated in a program called `` janmabhoomi  a program meant for keeping the city clean and green .but these activities are not followed later by most of the students .they become reluctant towards doing these activities .secondly , they do not show active participation in community activities like keeping it clean and green , improving the existing conditions of the society and working for the welfare of the community .they are the one who can improve the standard of living of the communities .i think every teenager should take the responsibility of helping their communities .in sum , i would like to reiterate myself that youngsters should give out time to helping their communities .
