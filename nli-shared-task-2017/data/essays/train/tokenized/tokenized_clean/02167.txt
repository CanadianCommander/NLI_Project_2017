i agree that most advertisements made products seem much better than they realy are for many reasons .first , they made a style that acceptable from customurs by puting thier products in a good shap to attract people to buy it .for example , i will buy any product if it is not having a good shape .also , the must know what people love in thier product and do that so they can write that thier product contain some materials which dose nt exist .for instance , i love natural materials in my product not chemical one so they write on thier product that it contains only natural product and that is not true .besids , most advertisements love to gain much money even if thier product would nt allow them to .they get a cheap material for thier product and says it had good ones to gain more money .for example , i used to buy a product for my child and suddenly he fall illness so the doctor do not allow me to this product for him again .in sum every things know a day is not as good as it appears .
