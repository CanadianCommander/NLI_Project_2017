as a young person myself , to judge wheather old people enjoy their life more or less than the young people could result in a hasty generalization , since i have limited knowledge on older people s view , but from the restrospect of my personal expereince , i think older people as an adults enjoy life more than the younger people , the teenagers .in our society , it is the common notion that teenagers are less serious , resposible , and even ` intellegent  when compared to an adults who are concieved as more experienced , wise and intellegent .consequently , the teenageer often face many social challenges that limits teenagers freedom to explore certain part of the society , such as voting or entering a bar/club .it is undoubtful that these laws that forbid teenagers or underaged people from exploring certain things are necessary to some degree in maintaing order in society , but when the degree of limtiation becomes overwhelming and too great , it also limits teenagers attempt to pursue their enertatinment and enjoyment .unfortunatley , ther are many societies and cultures that encourage extremely stringent rules against the teenagers , such as some asian countries like korea and china , thus limiting teenagers  options of enterntaining .in asian society , like korea , students until high schools must follow extremely stict guideline that is proveided by the school , such as keeping the hair to certain length and style , wearing uniform that resemebles that of everyone elses , and preoccupying constant academic pressure provided to all students from the school .unfortunatley , in korean society , almost all teenagers are going through this stringent lifeguidline and overwhleming pressure and expectations , which leaves no room for a brief hiatus or psychological respite for the teenagers .therefore greatly limts them from not only exploring the nature to develope appreciation for the nature , but also from pursuing their interest , passion , and entertainment .although this example only emcompasses the teenagers living in korean society , there are so many other society , though in different degree , have some preconceived misconception that discriminates or limits teenagers from pursuing certain things and exploring certain part of the society .therefore , discouraging oppertunities for youngs to fully enjoy life as the adult who have more freedom , do .
