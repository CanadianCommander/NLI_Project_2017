there are so many successful people in today s society .these people can be students , business man or even workers .generally , all areas have successful people .i agree with the opinion that these kinds of people always try somthing new even though they need to face risks .however , they wo nt do the thing they already know quite well .i think this is a kind of spirit called enterprise .i want to ask a question at first - how can people make success ?can people always do the same thing which he is already professional on succeed ?the answer is obviously - no .we can not deny that people should make great efforts to improve you own skills .is that enough ?you just focous on one thing , and you make it then pefect .you can be proud of it .but one skill is not enough espacially in today s society which is quite competitve .you always need to improve yourself .otherwise , you will not be able to catch up with the development of the society or other people s steps .everyone has the desire to be successful , but actuary not everyone has been successful already .why ?the differnce between successful people and common peole is whether they are brave enough .a successful people must be unfaithful to take all kind of challenges .these challenges will come out once you face a new thing .maybe someone has already tried a new thing but they dare to face the risks .they go back to the place where they stay before .successful must be happy to take these risks then they can make perfect .everyone know bill gates , he is very successful , he is still working on the new programs .that is why he can be the no.1do not envy the successful people in the society .they have their own way to succeed .in other words , they can do the things others dare to or can not do .undertake a new thing out of your scale , without faith , you can succeed as well .
