based on my previous experience , i am totally in agreement that it is more important for students to understand concepts than learning facts .i have realized when a person understands the concept and the reasons behind of this concept , it is easier to keep it in the memory for a long time .and to make this happen , the student must be willing to ask all the questions needed to clarify the concept during the class .in this case , teachers are the main contributors to make students understand the ideas .that means , teachers should use the following process to better explain a concept during class : first , mention the background of the idea ; second , explain the idea what is about , including examples and consequences ( if any ) ; and third , translate this concept in a realistic or insightful situation where students will be related with .having said this , if the teacher follows this flow , it will be very easy for students to understand the concept and store it in their brains for a long time without memorizing .on the other hand , when students are learning facts , there is a high probability to forget them very easily in the short term .the common mistake that students usually do when they have an exam in the next day , they start memorizing everything as it is the easiest way to get a good grade .whereas , teachers also do mistakes .proffesors develop their tests based on the theory exposed during class .this tests are normally very hard data driven and thats why students always memorize facts as they already know that the test will just ask for those facts rather than putting in practice the concept learned .in conclusion , there is an opportunity area for both students and teachers to know how to learn and teach concepts and ideas , respectively , in order to improve the educational system .
