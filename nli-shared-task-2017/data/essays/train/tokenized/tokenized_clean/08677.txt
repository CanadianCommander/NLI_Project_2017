i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are a few reasons why .one reason i disagree with the statement is that young people are required to help their community for certain hours .for me , as a middle school student , have to help my community for more than ten hours a year which is a lot for a middle school student .also , to get accepted into college , you need certain hours of community service .another reason is that the young generation has a culture of donation .donation could be a big help in the community and many young people are donating money to the community .for example , a college student who worked at a part-time job , donated more than half of his hard earned money .also , at schools , donations are made by students .my class collected money and donated it to an orphanage nearby , which is helping the community .the last reason is that the meaning of giving enough time to helping the community has changed .in the old day , there were lots of poor people who needed support from the government and the society .so people back then had to work very hard to help the poors and improve the community .but now , things have changed .there are not that many poor people in the community and things to improve .also , back in the old days , skills and technology did nt matter much because there were nt that many high-tech things to improve in the community .but now , it is different .non-skilled people can not help in the community because everything has become high-tech , so only people with skills can help the community directly .nowadays , we help our community by donations and during community service hours .these are the reasons why i disagree that young people nowadays are no giving enough time to helping their communities .
