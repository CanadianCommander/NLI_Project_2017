in my opinion it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .although it is very important to know facts , because they are necessary to understad many of the events which are occurring in our day-life , it would be very hard to deeply understand them just learning everything by heart .in fact , it is important to understand concepts because it s very easy to forget facts .for example , it would be quite impossible to study litterature or better history just trying to remember al the facts by heart .maybe it would be possible to learn like that for an university test but there are a lot of possibilities to fail the test because it s very easy to forget some informations or to invert some facts .so , it would be better just to try to undersand and to make some general schemes about a topyc in order to have some clear and general informations and in this way it would be easier to remember the facts because they would have a logical order .for istance , once i tried to remeber all the facts which occurred during the french revolution for an high-school test .i had little time to study so i thought that the better solution was to learn as much as possible all the facts by heart .i did not sleep at all to be prepared for the test , but anyway , i did not pass .the test day i was so nervous and tired that i almost forgot all the facts occurring during the french revolution and i was not able to pass the test , that it was actually very important to me .it would have been more usefull just trying to keep in mind all the main ideas and maybe i would have passed the test , or at least , i would have slept during the night time !
