recently , some criticism has been raised regarding the little interest of young people in helping their communities .however , i do not agree with it and think young people are still playing an important role in helping their communities .first , they do a lot of volunteer works .every spring and fall when the farmers are busy planting seeds or harvesting crops , many college or university students are seen to make volunteer groups to give them a little help .furthermore , a great number of highschool and middleschool students are taking in part in helping orphans or disabled people .secondly , young people attribute greatly to the community economy even if they do nt know they re or do nt intend to .they re the main consumers in the shops which is why so many brands have young people as their prior targets .they re also the main passengers for a lot of public transportations .while many adults tend to drive ther car to work , young people use buses or taxis to go to school .thirdly , thorough demonstrations , young people keep the community in a good direction .they protest against unequal treatments or improper administrations .these help the community habitants make sure that nothing unfair should be happened in their community .for the formentioned reasons above - young people do a lot of volunteer works , help the local economy , and have the community aware of improper things through demonstrations - i think that young people are doing their jobs in helping our community a better place to live .
