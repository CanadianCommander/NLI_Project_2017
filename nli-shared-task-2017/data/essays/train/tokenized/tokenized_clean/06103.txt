what may difine enjoying life ?just having fun and not doing what they suppossed to do ?as a younger generation person , i recent that statement above .people in our age , became more difficult than older people do .in my short life , i figured one thing ; what am i doing is not choice , this is requirement to live my life .most adults are going to their job at eight oclock or something like that .it is basically same as any other student .after we are going to school we are having bunch of tests or quizes from school .if we did not take this tests or quizes , our grade will be lowered .many people think this is just kidding if they compare to any adults , but this pressure is aweful .first of all , they are going to call their parents and their parents are going to yell at the child .this is not just stressful , it makes my life miserable .if it is only school work , than it is nothing .we have sat or ap subjects exams , which are not exist in adult world .we also have some extra activities that we need to go to .after all of these stuffs , we finally have a vacation .in two or three months , we are having enjoy our moment with pressure about sat or aps for next year .on the other hand , adult would is rudimentary .some older people say you are nothing but fake .what are they basically doing for their life ?during week days , they are going to their job or go to meeting .if something goes wrong , they need to fix it and maybe improve it for better jobs .there is differences between adult and young people .adults are choosing what they want to know and we younger people are forcing to do stuffs .it is really different .after their jobs or works , parents are asking how their school was and start to speak about better life .tt leads to us have more studying and every adults are going to enjoy their moment .they might be watching a tv or walking for their healthy .during weekend , while younger people are studying older people are going to play golf without any pressure .therefore , adults are enjoying more than younger people do .under certain circumstances , younger people enjoy little bit once an year .however , adults are enjoying their moment almost everyday and they only complain about younger people .therefore , i believe older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
