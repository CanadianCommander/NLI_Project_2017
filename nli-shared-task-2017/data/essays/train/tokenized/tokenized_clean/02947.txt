this issue raises lots of answers : we have to accurately weigh up the pros and cons .in a way , it depends mainly on the type of field concerned and of the stakes given by the society .indeed , our highly competitive and technological world tends to become more and more specialized , so that specializing in some areas such as information technologies or science in general are very useful .however , a minimum of competences are necessary in our wolrd nowadays because the general level of knowledge in our society has soared at an exponential pace in the last decade .so you should have also a broad knowledge .thererfore , in my opinion , both strategies are valuable to have a good educationnal history .fist of all , as regards the increasing scientific and technical shifts witenssed in our everyday lifes , i can not help thinking that specialists are necessary .for instance in medicine , all kinds of progress are made everyday such as in genetics stem cells research or cancer cures .these must be accompanied with specialization of medical school students .these progresses are often made in very competitive areas and specializing offers the student a difference with another ones that will allow them gaining prestige and rewards .another example would be enginnering , while generalists were very common in the past , a better strategy would be a specialization in one or two single subjects .namely , in that highly competitive field , you must focus on one thing at the same time to be competitive and aiming at one single kind of job .as a consequence , specializing in one subject area brings you a competitive advantage helping you to achieve easier than the others ; especially in scientific fields .however , on second thoughts , because of that competitivity , we have to build also a broad education .putting aside a minimum of competences in other academic fields would disable in a way the student .in fact , if you are an engineer , you have to learn another competences to be competitive .for instance the languages such as english or chinese provide you a serious advantage compared to others who can not speak these languages .moreover , if you are profficient at different academic fields , you have more chances to find a job : it does not restrain you .all things considered , i guess thet nor the first solution neither the second can really be preferred .nonetheless , i guess that a broad knowledge and a litthe specialization allowa you getting out of any situation in your professinnal life after .
