this statement present a difficult question : it is better to have a general type of culture or to specialize in a specific matter ?the statement asks that the first aspect is more important than the second one , but i am not in agree with it : i think that in modern life is important having a good preparation in all the fields of culture , but also it is indispensable to have a specifical knowledge on a matter ; in fact this is the role of university , to prepare a student for the specifical job he thinks he will do in the future .i have an example that confirms what i have said now : one of my friends , mario , has a great passion for the study ( he has readed all the volumes of his encyclopedia ) , but he does nt have studied a specifical matter , because he has nt frequented the university , so he has nt a job yet .on the contrary , my friend luca has studied mechanical engeneering and now , only two months after finishing the studies , he works in a great society of engeenering , and he gains a lot of money !in syntesis , i think that a general culture can help you to grow and to become more adult , but the way to obtain a job that can satisfy you ( by an economical and also professional point of view ) is to study a specifical matter .i also think that the person who has writed this statement has a more utopistic view of life than me .
