being young or being older influence the decisions , personal characters and the way of life , as well .by statement the way of life , i refer not only type of living but also the enjoment of that life .do young people enjoy life more than the elderly ?i agree with that statement , because youngsters are more enegetic , not stessful about the future , and not reluctand to experince new things .on the other hand , due their valuable experinces , senior citizens could have chance to enjoy more than youth .firstly , the younger people , due to very biological and hormonal feature of their bodies , are very enegetic , which could not be compared to energy of older people .being energetic gives youngsters a chance to do too many things within very short periods of time .on the other hand , elderly even there are too many energetic old people , can not due the same amount of things within the same period and also within the same quality .secondly , young people do not worry to much about their prospective futures .of course , they have some kind of concerns about their careers and study but it is better to think about the end of the life like somehow elderly do .it is more probable to the elderly to feel deppressive due to feeling old .finally , younger people do not have any oppositions against living and experiencing new things , such as new tastes , new adventures and even new friends .in contrast , senior citizens generally prefer to live in peace rather than in adventures .they have more concerns to continiue the stablity of their lives , which makes them somehow conservative , as well .in addition , we should not forget that due to their valuable expereinces , elderly in some cases can enjoy the life more .for instance , their experinces allow them to know what to do in which time .i hold the view that younger people enjoy life better and more than elderly .
