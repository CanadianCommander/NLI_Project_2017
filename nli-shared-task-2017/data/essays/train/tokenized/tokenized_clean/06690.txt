in my oppinion , these both suggestions : understanding ideas and concepts , and learn from facts .because these both teaches people a idea about common sense in the world .and some of the common sense or common knowledge ca nt be learned by own experience .for example , people often learn better behavior in their life through the religion .because some of the ideas that religion teaches people can not be figured out by one s own wisdom .and for the improvement of their life and spiritual health , people often willing to learn more about their religions .besides this reason , a lot of those beliefs , ideas that had been found by mankind in the history , always had begun from the curiosity about somebody else s idea .for example , the famous scientist galileo could prove the truth ,  the earth is spining around the sun  , indirectly by the idea based on roman catholic ; which he argued to .his conclusion about universe came from his own experience about the fact .but if he could nt understand the concept of the universe and ideas which people before galileo believed , he could nt take any chance to make arguement .just like the exemples showing above , to learn something from fact , we basically need to have some basic knowledge which had already been set by somebody else .through the history , the idea and peoples  creativity has been growing upon another .that shows the important conclusion ; people learn from the idea before they prove the truth by their own fact .along with this fact , we are living in the world that requires the proof ; we have to prove things that we have learned .if we know only the knowledge which learned from fact and we ca nt prove it .then our knowledge become just one s stereotypical method with our any reasons in the public .therefore , if we do not understand the idea and concepts which is generally proved as truth by somebody .we ca nt expect our fact that learned from experience to be general truth .in conclusion , to learn or to prove new things learned from our life we have to know about old concepts too .cause th
