some people prefer to deem that fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years , and others believe that it would be not true .newadays some may hold the opinion that we should limited the quantity of the cars , but others have a negative attitude .as far as i am concerned , i agree with that thinking of limited the cars quantity is a good choice .my arguments for this point are listed as follow .firstly , in the modern soceity , we can easily to consider the traffic jam is become the most significant problem that embrassed us .for example , every day i go back home by taking bus , i must to spent one hour , however actually the distance so closed .why ?the reason is clear , because of the traffic jam .this is a example not rare , more examples have showed about how horrible the traffic jam was .now if we decide to go to some place , we must to account how much time we should prepare to stay in the road , and make sure we will not delay our schedule .i saw numerous situations about how people delay an important meeting or lost the oppotunity of job .secondly , our city was a very beautiful city in the past , but after the advanced of people s life , the more people have the cars , the more air pollution was happend , now i could not see the blue sky and smell the fresh air .according a recent survey , the research shows that the pollution of air quality has been added more than twenty percent more than last year .may be after in ten years , we will be not able to know the sky color is blue .however , the goverment already set some methods to limited the pollution by car and make our traffic become more flexible , though decrease the numeber of the cars and prevent some large cars with pollution gas driving in the city , furthermore , to convinced us do not buy the private car instead to take the bus or subway .from what has been discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars id use than there are today .
