i partly agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .because students offen read textbooks of certain school or collage and in those books we only read the lessons and come to an idea and learn what the concept is , rather than knowing the facts .and coming to a chemical lab in our collages we require facts rather than ideas .for example go for a lesson in an english text there we find n number of stories and by reading those we come to idea of what happened in the story ratheer than knowing the facts .and coming to the lab we know about the fact that which reaction will come by combining two acids or bases .here we requirefact rather than idea .so understanding ideas , concept and facts are helpfull to the students according to the subjects they are reading .so at perticular time ideas and concepts play a major role where as facts on the other time .so , by these resons and examples i partly agree with the statment that it is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
