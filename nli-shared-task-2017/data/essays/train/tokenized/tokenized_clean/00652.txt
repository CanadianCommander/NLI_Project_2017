being able to speak about everything , even just a little , is a very attracting idea .however , i disagree with the statement beside .in my opinion , if on one hand people knowing the main issues of many major topics can be useful , on the other hand we still need very qualified people in very specific fields .particularly in politics , it is useful to have elected people who are able to take into account and to pay attention to a large panel of issues .their role will be to look at the pros and the cons and to decide .someone who is working hard on a topic might become unable to keep a clear sight of the whole situation .he or she might be likely to support his or her point .i think that it is the same at a smaller level .in a firm or in an association for instance , a person with a large knowledge is important to drive the whole structure toward the right way trying to define consistent decisions .however , we still need specialized employees and managers .consequently , students who wants to get a very specific training are very useful as well .these people are the bases of many domains of our society because they are able to give very precise specifics .when a manager or a director has to take a decision , he or she will ask advice to experts .if nobody was able to bring detailled answers , we zould live in a very syuperficial world .in conclusion , i think that both are very useful
