nowaydays , there is a great generation gap between the youth and older people .sometimes they are quite distinguished from others .it was generally agreed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .but in my opinion , i do nt agree to the opinion .in the first place , many young people enjoy their life so much .they are very modern and familiar with all the new-coming products .for instance , internet , electronic products , and newly conventions are made great use of by them .they realize what the real world is and have their ideal life style .their idea is to make the world colorful , funny and full of significance .only by doing things for the society can they feel real happiness .oppositly , there still remains a large number of young people who are doing nothing everyday .if they were asked what they are doing , they would answer they were enjoying .they drink , do sports , play computer games , change boy/girlfriends frequently , rob money or small items from children and do whatever they can .is it a real `` enjoy  ?absolutely no !ignoring the bad things they made , they lead to bad impact to the society .from the views of some people , older people are considered to be outdated .but to my surprise , in some cases they can enjoy their life much more than young people .in spite of their weak body , they will be laughing everytime .seeing the sun rising from the east , they will get up , doing exersice and listening to the radio .they will fill up their life with happiness .after they concern about the current affairs , they will note down their thoughts and send to the goverment .in cities , they will be a volunteer .the traffic manager , cleaner or a `` moving map  are shown ever all in all , both young people enjoy life .
