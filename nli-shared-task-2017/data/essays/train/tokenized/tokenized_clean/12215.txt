i agree with the following statements that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it id for them to learn facts .it is very easy for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning them .if they understand once they will never forget it and will be able to recall all the ideas and concepts .for example , in a classroom teacher is teaching something valuable and helping student in understanding the ideas or concepts with the help of some examples or experiments and due to this student will catch everything very fast whatever teacher has taught them and will recall it easily in future .students understands easily with the ideas and concepts rather than making them learn the facts .they will not remember the ideas or concepts or facts if they are made to learn it forcefully .learning never helps in understanding the ideas or concepts .ideas and concepts are always clear to students by understanding because understanding makes it clear to them and they pay attention to it and show their interests also .on other hand their interest keeps on reducing and cause lack of attention if they are made to learn facts forcefully .ideas or concepts about anything helps students to picturise or visualise the situation and doubts are cleared .its not necessary that students should always learn .there are otherway also of teaching students .now days time has changed teaching should be made by seeing the students interest and capacity of learning .studies should be made easier to students by making them understand the ideas and concepts .gaining knowledge about something is easier by understanding it the process of learning has changed or replaced by understanding ideas and concepts .at end i would like tosay that if we really wants students to improve then i suggest that the process of understanding ideas and concepst is better than learning facts .
