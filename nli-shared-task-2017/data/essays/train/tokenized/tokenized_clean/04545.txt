i do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product .all is studied to make it attractive , brillant , colourful , nothing is left as a coincidence but i reckon it is overpowerful .it occured many several times that the product was truly disappointing comparing to the advertisement .of course , it depends on what is the matter but very often i came to try new products that were not as `` fabulous  as they were supposed to be .i spent some money on various things , from cds to a dvd player , beauty products for my sister or very diverse things , which happened to be smaller than it was said to be , less efficient or to break very easily .my brother , who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be .the quality is below what he expected or the use of the mp3 player , for example , is not as varieted as it was written on the box .apart from the high technology , i would tend to say that advertisement does not lie so much about food products .is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it ?we can buy a television once within a couple of years , be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority , it is different from the food advertisements , or the items we regularly need to buy .actually , if it does not satisfy us , consequently we will buy another brand .obviously it is important to say that it does not happen all the time , with everything , but well , i think that advertisement should not ` pretend  so much thrilling qualities over a product .however i understand it is part of the commercial system , the advert has to focus on the pros of the concerned thing and the greatest it will appear , the higher the sells will be .
