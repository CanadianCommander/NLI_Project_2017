i disagree the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .i would like to present few reasons and examples to justify my opinion .in present scenario the use of cars has been increasing day by day .the first and one of the important reasons for the increased use of cars is urbanization .with the increase of the urbanization the use of cars has been increasing proportionally .i guess the scope for urbanization increases by a good extent within the next twenty years which further increases the use of cars .secondly , people got used to the luxury of travelling in a car and also the advantages of it .cars with more features and utilities are being introduced competitively .these cars increase the comfort levels and also save their time .there are a few cars which can even prevent accidents by their sensors , which can also give the details of the location that you are in .so people get attracted by these additional features of the cars and thus lead to the increased use of the cars ,there may be an argument that twenty years later most of the activities of the people may be completed through the use of internet .but people never stop themselves from going out and having faun travelling distances , meeting their friends personally etc .one more fact is that there are very few reasons for the decrease in the use cars like to control air pollution , to diminish the traffic on the roads etc. , which would be of less importance to people when compared to the need of the cars by them for their personal activities .if we consider a decrease in the use of cars then what are the means of transport ?the use of motorbikes , buses , railways , airways must be the alternatives which my not be as comfortable as using cars .so i conclude that there is a very less scope for the decrease in the number of cars in twenty years from today .
