how many times did we buy a product after been delighted by its amazing beauty or features and then , we found out that it was really useless , with our great disappointment ?as a matter of fact advertising does nt show the customer the downsides of its product or service , but emphasizes the essential advantages that it can bring into our lifes .if we go deeper into the topic , analyzing how people develop commercials and advertisements , we can identify why this can happen .first it s analyzed the ideal customer and , according to him/her tastes and preferences , some characteristics , or even emotions , are underlined in the advertisements .furthermore some tecnical devices are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer , for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt , surrounded by fresh fruits and pieces of chocolate , even if , in the reality - practically making the commercials - the yoghurt is just a white-coloured cream , so creamy that it s impossible to recreate into reality .in addition the advertisements can use the technique of the association to something else , even something that is completely different but that must share the same feeling of the advertized product .for example gillette , a famous brand of razors , made an advertisement for its product placing , on a page of a magazine , the shape of the razor , close to a ferrari , a sportif and expensive car .the two shapes had the same bright colours in order to underline their hypothetical similarity regarding the strong sensations they could offer towards the consumer .all this arguments are presented in order to emphasize some features that we feel , watching adverisements , and make products much better than they really are .
