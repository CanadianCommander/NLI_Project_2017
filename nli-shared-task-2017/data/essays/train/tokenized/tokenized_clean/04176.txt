we all know that technology is the most rapidly developing thing in the world and who can predict how we will live after twenty years from now !it is really hard to tell what will future bring us .twenty years from now , is a very long time and i think everything that seems imposibble today might be normal in daily life in future .this includes the use of cars , of course .i think i am not agree with the idea that fewer car wil be in use in a twenty years time period .because the 21 th century is the century of the speed .people even today are always worried for not to be late to go from some place to another .this is usually cause a big stress to people .i close my eyes and can imagine the time 20 years from now .what i see are people that are more faster and hurrying around than today s people .in my opinion people of future will need much faster cars than today s cars .furtermore they will need much more cars than they need today .because the number of the people is increasing day by day , rapidly .in order to support the increasing people s need the number of the cars will increase , either .another thing that supports my idea above is the globallism .the trade and the communication between counties are speading every day .this globallism will cause an increase in transportation between countries around the world .in order to transport easily and quickly from one place to another there will be more heavy transportation cars such as tracks exc .i think these are all to say in order to support my idea that 20 years from now there will be more cars than today .may be cars will change and may be they look diffrent but this wiil not change the fact that their number will increase .
