for the last decades society has been suffering the opposite way of `` humanities  conducts that were lived specifically in the 16th and 17th centuries , where people cared for others , for humanity , that s why was created the `` humanism  .the actual problem is the specialization of subjects that cut off the human relationships .instead of care by the person who lives close to us , we care more to know the reason of the molecular existance , for example .what i want to say is that in the way we obtain more broad knowledge of academic and cultural subjects , we could be better persons in society because we ll understand those who are the same as us and we also be capable to understand the problems we have as society .it is part of an open-minded education that the study of a specific subject could nt bring .to preserve peaceful relationships between different cultures , nations and between different personalities , as society we should perform educational curriculums that waranty a broad knowledge education .
