the given statement is a cynical and skeptic comment which is thrown at every generation .i can say with great pride that my generation can annul this cynicism in a number of different ways .in my own university we have a number of different activities through which we can contribute to our communitity .all these activities come under the banner of what is called the national service scheme or nss for short .i myself am a volunteer of this organisation and thus vehemently oppose the given statement .there is a wide range of ways in which we volunteers contribute to our community .every six months we organize a blood donation camp in our university in which students , faculty as well as people living close to the university come in great numbers to donate their blood .recently , i was also part of a successful project to assist the gardeners in improving the condition of trees in our campus .every alternate day around thirty students would spend the evenings watering the existing trees , pruning them , removing weeds and also planting new trees .we even managed to arrange for a water tanker to accompany us , thus saving the burden of carrying buckets all over the campus .our efforts over the past semester have paid off and the gardeners have now indicated that extra help is not required as the overall condition of trees has improved .other students who enjoy teaching have taken up a project in which they devote part of their time to interact with and teach blind children in a blind school in our city .the people who lament the decrease in such social activities among the youth should make a closer examination which will reveal that the youth social organisations are alive and flourishing .some of the graduates from my university have taken this community service to the next level by adopting it as their profession .this has manifested itself in the form of non governmental organisations which are non-profit organisations whose aim is improving some aspect of society .ngos can work towards providing safe drinking water to villages to working for the betterment of the lives of the elderly .young people with a passion for changing their societies are forming such organisations and are doing great wonders for their communities .
