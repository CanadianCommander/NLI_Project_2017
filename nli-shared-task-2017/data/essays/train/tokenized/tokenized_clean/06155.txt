as an engineering student i do think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .eventhough sometimes there are facts you must learn in order to understand concepts .one cannnot build a boat float if one does not know why it floats and therefore how much it can carries before it sinks .the concepts of physics need to be understood in order to adapt to every case and make the best choice in materials , shape etc .a historian can not explain a revolution only by facts .the understanding of the ideas shared by the different layers of the society is necessary and a simple description of events can not replace the analysis of the historical situation which is at stake .however , in order to understand subjects like biology or chemistry you need to learn a certain amount of facts .which element is to react with an other one , how the fast and how strong the reaction is .a doctor must learn where are all the bones and the muscles in our body before he can even learn how to make a diagnosis .he has to learn which drug can cure each illness .the learning process is not just about facts or ideas and concepts .to understand a concept , a fact can be helpful because our brain can associate an image to the concept .and the other way is also true , learning the ideas of romanticism without reading examples and facts is not worthy .global comprehension of a subject can only be reached once both ideas and facts are learned .to introduce a concept , it is a common easy way to start with a fact , something that can be observed , before the ides behind can be explained .
