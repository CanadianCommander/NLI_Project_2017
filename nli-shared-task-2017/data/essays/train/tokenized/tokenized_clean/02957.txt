i agree with the notion that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now , then there are currently based on certain facts and projections .firstly , we all know how the gasoline prices are rising everywhere .although part of the reason is political , there is no doubt that the amount fuel in reserves has dwindled rapidly .for a common commuter that means an additional cost , a cost which is not increasing with his/her income .slowly this would lead to people shifting to public transport .the goverments are also working in various countries to improve there public transport systems especially in the big cities .sooner or later most people would have access to good and efficient public transport .secondly , as the population in cities is rising there is lesser space for housing consequently either the cities would get bigger or more housing would be built in the space which is available as of now .if the cities get bigger , the distances might become to large for people to drive on their own .most people would , i feel , prefer getting on to a train and bus .not having the discomfort of driving these long distances and maybe getting some work done on the way .if more housing has to be built in the city , then the parking spaces and wide roads will have to go .in this case most definitely people would have no option but to leave their cars and rely on public transport .finally , with the rise in global temperatures being linked to green house emissons , the time is not far when governments would start charging exceptionally high taxes from people who are producing these gases to compensate for the nvironmental damage .the car owners , i think , would be one of the first to get hit with these taxes .so unless some radical new fuel which is both cheap and clean comes up in the next five to ten years , i think we are looking at much fewer cars twenty years from now in our urban environment .
