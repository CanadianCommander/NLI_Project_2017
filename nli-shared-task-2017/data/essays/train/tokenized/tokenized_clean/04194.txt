when a company designs or manufactures a product they need to be advertised .advertising is a way which helps people to know about the new product in the market .when people come to know about the product , the sales increase .this is the moto of the companies which are manufacturing the product : incresing their sale .but are these companies advertising the product in the same way as it is to be ?i do not think so .to increase sale these companies show their product in a very appealing way so that the customers will buy them .first , many advertisements we come accross hire a famous personality .this is one way of getting the attention of customers about the produt .usually , when these famous personalites tell about the product many do not actually think about the product rather they psychologically relate themselves getting binded to the famous person .as , his or her favourite person is shown with the product they think it is best .actually it might not be true .additionally , the advertisment uses the newer technologies to make the product more visually impressed so that the customer can buy it .a bowl which is made up of clay can be demonstrated very artistically by placing a beautiful background and on a clean table and flowers beside it .even though it is a simple clay bowl , due to this demonstration people think it can give the same impression when they buy it and arrange in the same fashion .but this might not be true because , they could have used the graphics to get the background of that advertisement .finally , sometimes the advertisements do not say about the diasadvantages of a product .usually advertisements put the good qualities in front of the coustmer .so the customer may not be aware of the other face .for instance when i had bought a rice cooker after seeing an advertisment ( in fact i was very impressed of how it was shown and the advantages of using that ) .later i realised that i had bought a bad one because it was nt convinent .it was difficult to clean .so somtimes the advertise do not say about the bad qualities of the product as , the reason for advertising is to improve the sale .in conclussion , advertisements help to get to know about a new product in the market but they are usually shown to impress the customers to increase their sale .so , people should be able to think about the disadvantages and facts about the product and make their choice .
