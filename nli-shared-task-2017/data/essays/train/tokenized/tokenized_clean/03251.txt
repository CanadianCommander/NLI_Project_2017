nowadays , young people would not like to give their time to helping their communities .there are several reasons to cause this problem .in my opinion , most of the young people are egoist .in their mind , they are not responsible to do something to helping their communities .their only responsibility is to helping their own house .besides that , they also think about that they can spend money to hire some guards or cleaners to keep the community safe and clean .for example , my friend , jean every month her family pay the maintanance fee to the maintanance department .she had never attend any meeting in her community .as i asked her why she did not attend the meeting , she answered me that she had paid the money and she was very busy to maintance her own house .secondly , the young people nowadays spend most of their time in studying .it is because our parents always told us that if we got good result , then we would have a great future also .most of our parents would like us to concentrate in our studying and disagree us to join extra activities to waste time .for example , i am a person who like to join the community activity .once day , my mother told me that she is not willing to see me spend my time in those activities .it is because she think if i spend the time to join activities to studying , my result would be better .however she does not like me to join the activities , but i still attend those activities because i can learn more .finally , some young people think that helping their communities are boring job .they would prefer to playing online games and watching television programme at home or chatting with friends are more atrractive .some young girls always say that it was very tired to do the job in their communities , but i think they would not say that shopping in the shopping complex is also very tired .for example , my brother is a very lazy person .as we ask him to do anything , he will refuse us and sleep on the sofa .sometime as his friends ask him to go to cyber cafe playing online game , he will wake up immediately .it is because the communities job can not attract him .as my conclusion , young people do nt like to spend their time to helping their communities because they are egoism , they are busy in their studying and the communities jobs are not attractive .
