although it would be a good thing for the environment if there were fewer cars in the future , i do not think this will happen .three arguments convince me that there will be even more cars in the near future .in the first place , most of us rely on their car to easily go to every place whenever it may be desireable .i am sure that no one will change this behaviour , unless he or she is forced to do so .i do not think everyone will suddenly use the bus or the train , because most of us would feel as if their mobility or personal right to move were restricted .therefore , there will not be fewer cars within 20 years .additionally , the number of cars is a global affair .i recently read an article about the emerging state in the far east , which mentioned the fact that people in countries like china are about to having gathered enough wealth to afford cars .imagine a billion persons from this region , who suddenly drive a car !so , even if the developed countries would reduce their reliance on cars , the number of cars would actually increase .quite on the contrary , one might argue that global society will have no choice but to use fewer cars in the future because of a shortage of oil .but i think that mankind will finally overcome this concern , at least when it is forced to do so , by using alternative energy .these technologies are already available today , but are not being used extensively for several reasons .eventually , when cheap oil is now longer available , car producers will switch , because of the peoples  reliance mentioned earlier .consequently , the number of cars will not drop significantly .in conclusion , i predict that the number of cars will rise instead of decline .i would feel a lot better with that , if people would take more care of their environment and use green cars today , even if they are a bit more expensive .
