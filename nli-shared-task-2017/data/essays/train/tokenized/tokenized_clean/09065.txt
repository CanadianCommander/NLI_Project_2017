i agree with the statement , `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .firstly , facts change during time .secondly , application is important for everyone than memorizing things .lastly , understanding ideas can help people on different situations .firstly , facts change all the time .for example , in the incient times , people thought that when the poplulation is higher , the food production will be higher ; and the growth of food is slower than the growth of population , that leads them to control birth .however , they had not predicted the development of technology .consequently , facts are changing .therefore , we could not learn all of the facts .the important thing is we should understand the ideas and the concepts , then we could apply in different matters .besides , as i mentioned , we should apply pur knowledge rather than memorize the facts .for instance , we memorize the gdp of every countries , but we have no idea about the gdp ; what affect the gdp and what does it show us .as a result , we can not learn facts that we do nt understand and we can nt apply .if we can not understand the ideas of the facts , the facts would be useless .therfore , we have to be able to understand the ideas and concepts than learn the facts .finally , since we learn how to apply our knowledge from understaning ideas and concepts .we can have abilities to solve problems because we have difficulties all the time .for example , we can understand the concepts of developing films and printing pictures , so that we can adjust the colour , light , or the size we want .by showing this example , it can help us to understand that it is important for us to understand and apply through different circumstances .in conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the changes of facts , application of knowledge and the advantages of understanding ideas .
