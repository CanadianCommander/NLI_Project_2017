i agree with the statement proposed , here is why .education has walked a long way to become what it is today .take your father s class and you will be confronted by a `` memory rules  approach .everything has changed and the place of the memory is one of the biggest victim of this evolution .`` learning facts  has the fatal flaw of beign associated with memory , otherwise , how you will remember a date , an event or the name of one president ? .a fact is just a tale of something that happend .the last couple of years saw an increase in education research .tens of theories has been proposed and in some cases , has been tested .one has emerged as the current champion : constructivity .constructivity means that everything we are going to learn has to be builted on the shoulders of something we already know .that way , we are not dealing with a million of separate facts to remember but with a few knowladge networks that will activate a couple of related ideas every single time we touch one of the ideas belonging to the same network .what s the magic of these ? , that studies had proved that we have three tipes of memory , a short-term , a mid-term and a long term one .short term allow us to dig a lot of information but to lose it fast , medium will let us remember that we have touched the subject , but the details will be gone .long term memory is composed of all the things that impact us in a unusual way or the things we use every day .constructivity tries to place our knowladge in the medium and large-term area by changing the frecuency of use .
