to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts always is a important question when teacher or parents educated children .it is a chicken-egg question , i think .but i prefer to let students to learn facts at first .facts are the real reflection of the ideas and concepts .it is the real item , visual image , or true things happens in everyday live .we can catch it around us , we can feel it beside us , we can heard it from surrounding evironment .it does not like the imagination of ideas and concepts ; it is the real version of ideas and concepts .how do the ideas and concepts come from and where do they come from ?this is the relationship between ideas and facts .most ideas come from the thinking and studying of facts .from this point , we can state : facts are the mother of ideas and concepts .if everyone just thinking everyday , and nobody come to the real world and make these ideas come true , what will our world become ?also , facts will help us to understand ideas and concepts deeper and stronger .for instance , many people have taken chemistry , biology , or other science courses during high school .teachers always let students to do differetn laboratry when studying a new subject .the different lab and the observations of these activities are the fact .most teacher want students to understand the ideas or concepts that they tell students more impressive .the visual items or truth can help people memorize and understand more effectively .as i studying different subjects , i usually prefer to know the facts of them .after that , i can see the real reflection of it and figure out how to reinforce the deep thinking that hide back of the topic .although ideas and concepts are the basic of almost facts , to see the items related to our real life is more useful for me .
