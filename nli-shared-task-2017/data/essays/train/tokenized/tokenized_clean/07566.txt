unfortunately , the experience of buying a product and not getting what we had expected is common to everybody .however , it is not a frequently occuring experience .we live in a society that is completely consumer driven .people buy countless products in their everyday lives and are perfectly happy with what they have bought and this is the reason why they keep buying .if consumers truly believed that they were being tricked by deceptive advertising they would simply not buy the product anymore .taking into account that consumers are the driving force in the economy this would undoubtedly send any company with such deceptive practices into bankruptcy .nowadays , it is no longer tolerable for a company to decieve their customers through advertisements that make their products look better than they actually are .in fact , important organizations have been established in order to protect consumers from such deceptions .the company involved in such activities would have to face large fines as well as the very negative publicity that such a scandal would cause .another reason why it is infeasible for a company to make use of such advertisements is because of the competitiveness of the world market .monopolies are no longer the norm as in the early 20th century .companies must constantly be seeking for ways to offer the customer a better product because they know that if they do not keep up with the market it will most definitely not wait for it to catch up .deceptive markiting is not a good choice for any company .
