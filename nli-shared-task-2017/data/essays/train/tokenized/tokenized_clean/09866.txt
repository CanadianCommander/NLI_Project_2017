i agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more beneficial than learning facts to students .while understanding makes students truely keep the idea , learning fact only make student memorize the idea .there are more advantages in understanding than in learning facts .in these days , the society needs the people who can not only work with their knowledge but also apply it to the work place .if the people just memorized the fact , they might be a good worker but can not be a better worker .in contrast , if the people understood the ideas and concept , they can develop the way they work by applying what they know .this is the same in the class too .in my case , i was just memorizing math formulas instead of understanding the facts .it seemed to work very well when i do the simple questions .however , in difference to my expectation , i was not able to solve the application questions .so i started to understand the concept by asking my teacher .then , i could solve every questions on the test and recieved the good mark .similar to my experience in math class , one of my friend experienced the advange of understanding in english class .she has been always hard-worker .she does everything with her best effort .in her english class , she worked hard on `` hamlet .she read the whole play twice and memorized important lines and devices used in the play .her teacher , however , did not expect the stuedents to study in that way .her teacher wanted his student to actually understand the play , and express the educated emotions about the play .on her first test , she recieved faily poor mark .so she started to look at the play in different characters  prespectives .then she recieved the good mark from her english teacher .through my experience and my friend s , i learned that understanding is more important than just learning or memorizing facts .as shown above , when students just learn facts , they can not apply their knowledge into the deep study , while those who understand the ideas and concepts can get better and better as they study .thus , i think students should focuss their study on understanding instead of focussing on memorizing .
