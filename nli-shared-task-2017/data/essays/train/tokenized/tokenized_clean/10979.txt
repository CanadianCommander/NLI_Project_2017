some people say most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .i agree with it .when people watch a television , read newspape or walking on the street , they see a lot of advertises .even though people do nt concentrate about that , they already have influenced .the first problem is the company cheats the costomers .when the company make a commercial for selling product , they usually try to show there products as the best and they tell them only good points .due to they made people beilive that products does nt have any defects and costomers but it .however , there are also many bad points .it is one of the cheating .the other one is overconsumption .the commercial stumulates people want to get that products and actually they do nt need it , but they buy it .sometimes buying is caused to develop the economy , but typically it has to disappear .third reason is cost .if they make an advertisement , they need money and when they make an advertisement that is looks better , they have to pay more .it is going to be caused the increase .the increase will poor people suffers from money .the purpose of companies is make money .whereas they earn money , the people s saving decrease .the companies must make good products and after costomers will be able to judge it .
