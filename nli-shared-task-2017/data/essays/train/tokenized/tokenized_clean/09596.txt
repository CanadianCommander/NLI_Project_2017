how do you like to travel by yourself with a tour book or with a tour guide s leading ?many variables can exist that which way to travel is the most influential .regardless of the possibilities , i strongly support that traveling in a group leading by a tour guide is the best way to travel because of the substantial amount of information one would get .being in a group positively makes a person to know more people .from my experience , a group tour opened my eyes more toward the world .i had two trips to new york city : the first one by myself with a tour book and the second within a group led by a tour guide .going to the new york city by myself with my own knowledge put me in such a hardtime .i guessed that with a tour guide hand book , i would be able to handle the situations well .however , the prediction was completely wrong .i was lost and for finished the tour in a week instead of the original plan , three days , because of my lack of ability .however , the second trip to n.y.c with a tour guide in a group was only two days and the trip was very enjoyable .i learned a lot of new facts about the city from the peers .traveling in a group led by a tour guide would certainly cost more .in this case , one has to weigh the price that he would get from a tour guide more .by traveling with a group he can meet new people and interpret the places in more different ways .i went to italy last year with in a group with a tour guide .the trip was more expensive than i would just go with my friends .my friends and i were in the same group and within the group we met a lot of people .by meeting these new people , we could apply different knowledges and understand the rome with diversity of information .although traveling by oneself might be a good experience , traveling in a group is better because of the amount of the information one would get is umlimited .
