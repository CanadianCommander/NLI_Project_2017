it was five oclock and i was sleeping on my confortable bed in my home .suddenly , i woke up crying and screaming .i could nt believe it , i had had a bad dream .before , i realized that dream had a profound effect on my feelings .the dream was about a trip where i got lost and there was nobody next to me .i was afraid !! .i agree with the statement that says that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .the reasons why i agree with that are my personal experience of traveling alone and the costfirst , one of the reasons to travel with a group is my personal experience .i went to brazil alone and i did nt enjoy it so much .i realized that i do nt like traveling with no people .all the trips should be done with people who you care alot .moreover , i would like to visit others places like bolivia and chile , both countrys from south america .but , i d go with my close friends .one who spends with their relatives or lovers have fun more than one who spends time alone in a foreign country .futhermore , the cost is another reason why i think that taking a guide for your group trip is a good idea .visitors spend more money going by themselves to an unknown place .if you have a guide , he or she is going to tell you where you should go to eat delicious native meals .also , he or she can tell you the cheaper restaurant in the city or town .in adittion , everytime you travel with a group , the discos and taverns are the favorite places to have fun .there , you can dance and drink all you want with less money .in conclusion , the best way to travel is with a tour guide .he or she can show you where to go , where to eat and where to have fun without paying big amount of money .other way to travel is doing it with a group .to be in a foreign country alone is not agood idea because something could happen to you .moreover , being with your bestfriends or maybe with your family makes the trip more exciting and unforgetable .
