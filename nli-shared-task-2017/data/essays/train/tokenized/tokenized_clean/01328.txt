i do agree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .firstly , the cause of global warming is the important point which i would like to support my view .elucidating about that .we can observe the temperatures around us during the summer season .the seasons are modifying gradually .we ca nt expect the rain in the rainy season .it is due to the alteration in the atmosphere cycle .it s happening all around india .the main reasons are the atmosphere is getting warmed due to the green house gases that are emanating from various sources like the motor vehicles , cars , factories etc. , concentrating mainly on the cars .they are releasing the harmful gases like carbon monoxide , carbondioxide etc. , which are detrimental to the human beings .may be the government introduces a law that usage of cars may be prohibited and the usage of public transportation may be considered .secondly , the earth is running out of the renewable resources .even though that is not predicted , i hope that is so imminent due to the usage of the natural resources like petroleum , diesel .today the prices of the petrol and the diesel got hiked and they will definitely go more higher in the coming years .from economic point of view the people may prefer other means like public transportation for reaching their destinations .let the petrol and the diesel supply be ceased for a month everywhere in the world for cars .then see how much the number of people using the cars would defintely decline .they will definitely opt for the public transportation .later see the pollution of the environment .i bet that u can definely notice a steep decline in the pollution level .even if any other source for driving the cars other than petrol or diesel is invented .that too does nt last long .lastly , the science and the technology is developing at a rocket pace .nowadays you can buy everthing from your house by a single click of your computer mouse .i hope that the entire world will be digitalized by the next twenty years .if that happens , then definitely people dont need any cars for transportation .so it is also a possible way that the number of the cars get reduced .
