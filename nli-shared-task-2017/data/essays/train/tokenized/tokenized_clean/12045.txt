in marketing , the tools that are used to convince the costumers to by the products are various .some of these tools , like samples , are honest , and give a true idea about the product , while other tools , like advertisements , may sometimes give a false image about the products , and we find that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , which is logical because the mission of such advertisements is to make the consumer prefer this product to other competitors .advertisement is an art , but i cnsider it a little far from honesty .so , in any advertisement , the conclusion is that this product is the best among its all other competitors , which ca nt be true for more than one product .this applies especially when the product is a service , like a company that advertise for a one-week trip , with all its details , the customer sees the adv .and decides to believe it , so he takes the trip with this company , then he discovers that everything which was described in their brochure is just so away to be fact , and they planned the trip just to be with the least cost `` for them  .the problem that within the adv. , they include some phrases or conditions that protects them legally .i believe that most of the people realize the fact of advertisement now , and to be fair there are certain products that are beyond any adv. , and people know these produts , in which case they do nt need to be advertised , but with other products and advertisements , people must be careful and catious so that they do nt get decieved by advertisements .
