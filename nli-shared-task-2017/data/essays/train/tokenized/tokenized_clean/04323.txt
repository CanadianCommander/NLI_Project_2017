trying new things and exploring untouched parts are indispensable parts of development .in this context , one may argue against the idea of doing what one already knows how to do well .despite that one can not make much change and development , one can keep safe from losing something and can be expertise at one subject that the person has been doing so far .therefore , i disagree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first of all , when one tries new stuffs , the person must take risks of losing money or time .when doing what one already knows about , one can be safe from the loss .for example when people go to a restaurant , most order what they have already tried and what they liked .in this way , they can enjoy the food for sure , but if they tried new meals knowing nothing about the food , they can waste money and time eating it .as the example illustrates , it is better to do what one is sure about to be safe and enjoyable .secondly , by doing one thing over and over even though the person knows how to do well , the person can obtain experties to the subject .overwelming of empirical evidence conducted over years confirms that continuous practice can make a person expert .having an experties is very important to succeed , so even when people apply to universities or writing resumes , it is important to emphasize and show their unique experties that can be contrated to others .in order to get experties , repeating more and more even after knowing about it well is important .by tring new things , one may experience new fields of study or material through some failures , but rather than taking such risks , one can enjoy what one knows without worrying of failure and rather than knowing vast range of stuffs shallowly , being experties at one subject and showing the unique advancement is better .
