the question , whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one spefific subject is an issue of controversy .first , i am going to point out the most important points in favor of having a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects .in my opinion it is very important to have a reliable basis of general knowledge in many different field of study , in order to be qualified for all upcoming challenges in future life .especially in our modern times , one can never be 100 % sure to be able to keep the same job during one s whole carreer .this means diversity is what counts today .people need to be adaptive to new kinds of tasks all the time , which will obviously work best , when they are educated as broadly as possible .on the other hand , there are also arguments in favor of specialising in one specific subject .to begin with , i would like to point out that despite the advantages of having general knowlegde in many academic subjectes , this knowledge will always stay at quite a superficial level .it is simply not possible to get a deeper understanding of many different academic subjects , as each one of them is very complex in itself .in order to work in a responsible position , i.e. as a doctor in a hospital , the general knowledge is not sufficient .this implies that at least for responsible professions it is absolutely necessary to specialize in one specific subject .in addition , human beings are a very diverse species .not everybody has the same competencies .this means that people should be able to specialize in the areas they are interested in and in which they are able to compete .for example a professional pianist might be very dissatisfied , if he had to go to classes of economics instead of being able to go to more music lessons .to sum up , there are points in favor of having a broad knowlege in many academic subjects and points that argue in the opposite direction .in my opinion , a compromise should be found : during the first year at an academic institution the students should be able to gain a broad knowledge of many different fields of study but they should then be allowed to specialize in any area they want to , as nobdoy should be forced to study a subject they are not interested in .
