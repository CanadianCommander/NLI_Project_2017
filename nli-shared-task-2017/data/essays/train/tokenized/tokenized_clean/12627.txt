i think it is really important nowadays to have many academic subjects .indeed , a person who have different skilled can easily understand different point of view in a company .this understanding is really necessary for people who is an manager .he has to managed people , suppliers , to understand consumers , to take decisions for his company .for example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take in account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions .the survey of the company can be in danger .moreover , we can take the example of an individual entrepreneurs as a director of a restaurant .if the director do not have knowledge in cooking , the cooker can do everything he wants .this kind of advantage can be dangerous for the director because he does not really understand all about his own restaurant .i think that sometimes is really necessary to have knowledge in different types of subjects even if we are specialized in on or few specifics subjects .furthermore , it can be really interesting to somebody to have different academic sujects not only for working but to his own .as for me , i think we can have both , knowledge of many academic subjects and be specialized in on specific subject .both can be an advantage , a strenght .everything is changing so fast so people have to understand rapidly why and how things change to take efficient decision for a company .
