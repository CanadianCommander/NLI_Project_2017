i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community  .there are so many reasons and examples to support my opinion .it is each and every one s responsibilily to help their community .young people have to spend some time to help their community .in so many communities there are so many poeople do not have minimum requirements like food , cloths and shelter .youth people should take forestalls to prevent the spread of this to future generations .my personal experience is that i saw so many people who are young in participating the social development activities .even though youth is busy with their works they know that the nation s development depoends on the individual development of all communities .generally young people inspire by their patriots and the social workers .for example in our city i observed so many poeopole who are trying improve the literacy and ameliorate the lives of fetid slum areas .really i impressed by them alot .so it is necessary to young people to help their community . .then only natiion s development will occure .nowadays life became very busy .but it should not affect our participation in helping our community .we have to share our time for all the things .young people are spending their time improve the way of life of poor and they also increase their time to involve in social developoment .finally i conclude that it is necessary to give enough time to helping their community .
