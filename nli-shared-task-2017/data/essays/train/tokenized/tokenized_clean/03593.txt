most of us feel overwhelmed by advertisement every day .we see it everywhere in town , even along the highways .many people do not like it because it seems penetrant and unhonest to them .but is it really trying only to fool consumers ?advertisement is information , first of all , it informs us about a new product .and it is a comfort and easy way to get to know what s new on the market .and no one can force anybody to buy the thing .in many countries there are rules for companies - they are not allowed to advertize something by lying about it .but it is evident that limits are not clear , when does suggestion end and lying start ?if a perfume company engages a model to tell the consumers that she or he feels attractive and irresistable by using the perfume this might be true .there is no guarantee that the consumer will feel the same but it is suggested .advertisment wants to attract people by promising them a great and wonderful product that will change their lives .rationally thought it is clear that not every new hamburger , perfume or shaver will change our lives .but advertisement tries to attract the inconscient parts of the brain .we often do not think about it rationally and long time .many companies promise the potential consumers to fulfil their deepest wishes - if they just buy the product they will be beautiful , intelligent and loved .i think that most advertisements definitely make products seem better than they really are and i think that many or most of the suggestions made by advertisements can not be fulfilled .so it is necessary to handle advertisemant with a certain attention and prudency .i also like being informed about new products but it is essential to think about its real use .of course companies try to influence people only because they want to make profit but on the other hand it s the people s decision to buy their product or not .
