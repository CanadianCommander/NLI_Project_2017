`` taking risks and gainig success is a combination which connot be split , because one thing is the reason for the other one  .this was nearly the first setence i heard by my professor of economics .now , approximately 18 months after i heard this statement , i am discussing the advantages and disadvantages of people who take risks and the effect this has on their success .i reckon that , as it can be observed in the global economy , business just seems to work by taking risks .therefore people like managers , who are involved in deciding-processes , are responsible for their decision .in some cases they can be wrong , but in others , they are right and for being right they ear honour , apart from the money they get , which makes them successful even in another direction .if there were no people taking these risks , our whole economy would not be so developed as it is , because without visions of people and their risks to put them into action , many of us would not have a job for instance .additionally , i think that it is routine that makes people sick of the life they live .people who always do the same things for years are often unsatisfied with their life .i would truly recommend those people to live their dreams and to go for their goals , because everybody has visions and targets , which are worth to be fought for .however , in my opinion , every change is connected with a certain risk .consequently everyone should balance if a new beginnig would lead to a better state of satisfaction .it appears to me that successful people nearly all share one common character trait : their self-confidence .self-confidence is absolutely a most for being successful because there are always hard situations and some people who do not make life easier for someone , who is progress of changing something .finally it want to support my arguments by citing my own philosophy of life : `` by taking risk , connected with a bit of luck , people can built a bridge from all the stones they get thrown on their track to success and satisfaction .
