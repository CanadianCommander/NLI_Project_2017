the given thesis is highly controversial , especially when we take into consideration that the german academic programs were recently reformed towards that direction .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects goes hand in hand with an extraordinary wide spread education which is useful in various different ways in everyday life .knowledge in terms of biology , for example , can be easily applied to everyday experience during a walk in the near forest .questions posed by children may be answered appropriately and correctly in an enormous amount of fields .on the other hand , today s economic and societal development of our society results in an increasing differentiation concerning work tasks and work skills .it is required to adapt to these new circumstances in a world which is on its way to become a global village .in order to cope with this high-speed development , it is important to specify on a very small aspect of an academic discipline .in order to bring my point across , i would like to give a short example : small knowledge of economics in general is less asked for in today s globalized world than knowledge concerning the solar energy markets in china .from this it follows , that i do not agree with the given thesis .at least not with the way it is formulated .from my point of view , a good general education and knowledge is the basis for more differentiated and specified knowledge in a certain field .whereas the first helps in the private sector of an individual ( for example when it comes to his social status or social prestige ) , the latter is necessary in the public sector , namely the field in which the individual is working .it is absolutely essential , to be an expert in that particular field .otherwise , a high-quality performance is not provided .to sum it up , a broad knowledge and a very specialized knowledge concerning a certain topic should go hand in hand and lead into a compromise .
