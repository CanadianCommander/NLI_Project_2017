cars are the indispansible part of our life .i ca nt imagine how life would be if there were nt any car .they are like the member of our family .because people like cars even more than it used to be .they are trying to make their car more comfortable and beautiful since they spend so many times at roads .some people consider that cars wo nt be the part of our life in twenty years because the oil reserve of the world is decreasing very rapidly .so maybe only rich people will be using cars in the future .can you imagine this , maybe there wo nt be traffic jam .and also this is not a real proof .i think we wil be more dependent on car in the future because our life is changing in so many ways .the density of population is considerably increasing .so these people will need cars to go somewhere .i am totally disagree about the idea that we will use less car in twenty years because people have began to use new sources instead of petrol such as biodisel and electrycity .from my point of view that will help humanity to save the environment since that does nt give harm to environment like petrol .and also technolgy is still trying to develope new kind of things to support cars to work .what is more , what will the people do if there will be fever cars .are we going to fly or something like that .i think what is said about this is not based on scientific evidence because we need cars and we will drive them at least a hundred years .we can also say that the woman driver are more than in the past and they will be more in the future than now .so the factories take these kind of things in to account .nevertheless they do nt seem to stop producing cars .to sum up , i believe that cars are the part of our life and people do nt seem to leave them for a long time .although the bad impacts of cars to the environment we ca nt disregard how useful they are .
