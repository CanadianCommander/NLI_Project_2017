from my point of view i ca nt agree with the statement , that the young people of today do nt offer enough of their time to help their communities .in the following passage i will try to explain my point of view and give special arguments for this conviction .if you want to have a discussion on this topic , you must first of all set a definition of what the term < helping other people > actually implies .to me , helping other people is evey form of making an effort to suuport other people in any part of their lives .in my social and personal environment i have experienced a lot of situations in which people and especially young people have spent a lot of time on helping other people .starting with helping other pupils in class who are nt able to cope with their homework on their own , to helping other fellow students in university with special tasks up to helping old people in situations they ca nt handle anymore on their own .in my opinion , another aspect of helping other people can also refer to sport activities .for example in my rowing club is was a common procedure that the older members teach the younger how to row .by this way of proceeding also the younger members became awre of the fact , that they depend from the help of the older people in the club and as a consequence of that , there was no question about it , that helping each other was the overall principe of this sports club .this shows to me that in our society the principe of helping each other is widely spread , and that especiaklly young people are aware of this neciissity .
