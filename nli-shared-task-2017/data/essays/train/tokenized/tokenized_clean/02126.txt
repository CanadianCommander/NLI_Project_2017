many people travel around the world in different ways .and it is true that one of the best ways to travel is going in a group which is led by a tour gide .however , i strongly disagree with this way of traveling .i prefer the way traveling by myself .and there are several reasons for my way of traveling .first of all , if i travel alone , without guide , i can experience more valuable things compared with guide traveling .i agree that traveling in a group led by a guide is convenient and can visit well-known places quickly .however , while traveling with tour buses you just take pictures or walk around places .you do nt really have free time to experience something spcial .as the schedule is too tight , you will just look around many places .if i travel alone , however , i can spend my time freely and experience something unique .for example , when i was traveling malaysia , i actually stayed with native people .eventhough we could nt understand throughly , we could become a good friend .from there i could experience the way of the native people s life .it was an unforgettable experience in my life .next , most people thinks that traveling with a tour guide will be cost effective but this is not true .if you travel alone you can actually save more money .as a tour is operated by a guide company , the company tries to get more profits .so they increase the traveling fees .two years ago , i actually wanted to travel japan by a tour guide company .but before i book i checked how much money will cost for the traveling by using the internet .and it was surprising that the fee which the guide company suggested was two times hire than original cost to tavel .so traveling with a tour guide is totally not cost-effective way .in conclusion , the guide traveling is sometimes needed to travel certain places such as alaska .but in my opinion , traveling by oneself is the best way .because it gives you much experience which is unforgettable and you can save a lot of money .
