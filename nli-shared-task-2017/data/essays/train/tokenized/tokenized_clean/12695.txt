i completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are many reasons for this agreement .firstly , young people take more rescue than older people .they can start any new venture , they can get into any new adventure .while older people being experienced and having lack of energy are not ready to take rescue .i belive to enjoy a life one needs to be ready to take new paths which will require rescue taking abilities which generally youngsters are fully equipped with .secondly , young people are very immature as compared to older people .being immature they can take fun in small activities , gossips , hangouts with friends .they have not seen the hard parts of life so they tend to believe everything and try to take things light heartedly and enjoy whatever they are involved in .thirdly , older people have fewer friends as compared to youngsters .friends are the most important means to achieve happiness and to enjoy life .having few friends make older people feel lonely since they have few people to share their joy and happiness .on the other hand , youngsters are always busy with friends .youngsters have too many people around them to share their achievements and happiness .fourthy , older people are misers .to enjoy life i believe one needs to spend money on his comforts and luxuries .money can bring the means to enjoy life .for example one can go for a world tour if he can afford to do so .older people do not prefer to spend money on unncessary things , while youngsters enjoy spending money on friends , parties , travel .because of being misers older people prefer to spend time at home .they do not believe in parties and always try to save every penny .in sum , i believe young people have more fun in life than do older people have .
