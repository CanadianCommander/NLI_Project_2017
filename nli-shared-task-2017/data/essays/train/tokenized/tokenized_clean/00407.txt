nowadays young people think and do things only for their selfish satisfactions .in some cases people help other people only bacause they are required to or because they can get in income from it .fortunally not everybody is like this , infact there are many people that sacrifice a lot of their free time to help others only because they like to do it .i strongly think that helping its own community is a real significant and remarkeble thing to do , it makes you a better person and it certainly makes many other people even happier than you are .if i had to be really sincere i wuold say that i ve never been a person that gave time helping my community because i ve always been more occupied on my studies , sports and having fun with my friends .but this year i wanted to change something in my life , so in september i decided to get in an organisation that helps old people .so know i usually stay with them and simply give them my company or usually i go to the supermarket to buy things they need .i started only one month ago but i really feel a better as a person and as part of my community because i fell that i m giving something that only i can give .overall thanks to my experince i understood that spending time helping its communities is the best way to become a better person and also to meet knew people .
