i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not use enough time to helping their communities .i think that it depends on the education and the economic condition which young people and thier communities have .first of all , japan , where i live in , has many volunteers organization which help local communities .many young people belong to these organization to help the older people and the handicapped persons in their communities .in my experiences , when i was university s student , i belonged to several volunteers organization .the organization was established by students to help the local community .many young students worked sincerely for there to get satisfactories of their mind .in japan , we can find many volunteers organization founded by young people .in japan , we learned the importance of helping our own communities .in this result , many japanese have helped other persons and communities since children .i think that it depends on the education which they were given whether young people helps others or not .secondly , i think that it also depends on the economic condition on their communities .especially , in japan , some of areas which have much budgets on welfare , young people do not help their communities very much .in these reasions , the local social organizations help their communities mainly by using enormous budget on welfare .to help communities is the social enterprise in which much of unemployed people work to get money .in such condition , many young people do not need to help thier communities .for these reasons , i disagree with the statement that young people do not use enough time to helping thier communities .i think that it mainly depends on between the education which young people had and the economic condition which their communities have .
