the following texts deals with the question whether it is the best way to travel with a tour guide .traveling with a guide has many advantages over traveling without guidance .a tour guide knows the area well and therefore , will guide the tourist to the most remarkable and worthwhile spots of a city .commonly the guide is familar with the historical backgroud of the area , and will be able to explain the landmarks and the development of a metropole .besides the well-known highlights , a guide will also be aware of secret spots and so , allow the tourist to be intoduced into the side of an area that is out of the spot light .that will not only show an often charming and different side of a city , but also completes the big picture .in addition to that , guided explorations are safer since the a person who is familiar with the area will also know the unsafe places where it is not recommended to go .on the other hand , traveling without a guide is more of an adventure .it is up to the traveling group to explore the city and to find both , the landmarks and the secret spots .the travellers are more likely to get in touch with locals since they are not as isolated from the `` normal crowd  within a group of guided tourists .i also believe that traveller will experience a trip differently , if it is not organized perfectly by a guide .the travelling persons can set their own pace and adjust the amout of daily explorations to their actual ability to concentrate which makes a trip less exhausting and more pleasant .i summery , i believe that travelling without a guide is is the better way to explore a city .
