no i donot agree with the statement .youngsters are now a days really looking active to spare time for helping their communities .community may mean by area , by religion , by race and many .now a days youngsters have been looking for helping their home countries in a big manner .i have many reasons to support my statement .in olden days youngsters used to work hard for themselves and their families .but its different in the modern case .youngsters are being in the front row of doing service to all of their communities .they help them in all the fields .donating blood to the people in need , helping old people , ladies in all aspects .students are conducting welfare programmes , encouraging poor students by giving scholarships , helping the flood affected people by joining the natural disaster schemes and many to tell .the young people who are working in corporate jobs having been sparing time on saturdays and sundays in serving the needy .they are enjoying happiness of helping in such manner .i had an example to support my staement .the following example took in my native place guntur .a small boy who is affected with a viral fever named denguea fever is in need of blood as blood from his body has been completely going out .so one student gave 2000 rs to that persons father and asked him to give an advertisement regarding the need of blood .as my blood group too was the same i went to the hospital to donate .by the time i went there were about 800 students who came there to donate .the boy in need is not a brother or relative of anybody .but all the students came there as they had the intention of helping people in their community .another best example for supporting my statement is the army of our country .according to the records of 2005 our army contained 80 % of youngsters who were even ready to offer their lives for their mother land .finally i strongly stand by my word that young people of modern times are sparing more time for helping their communities .
