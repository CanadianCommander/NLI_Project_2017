i do not support the statement stated .the reasons that support my contradiction are stated below .cars are being manufactured in counts of thousands per day per unit throughout the world .automobile technology is one of the most progressive aspect of today s generation .it has become the basic need of mankind .in fact , without the use of automobiles , life today would have been very difficult .for public transportation , automobiles are required .they are used in transportation of goods from one place to another .all basic and essential requirements such as ambulances , fire trucks , breakdown wagons , cabs etc are all automobiles .it has become a matter of concern regarding the disadvantages and ill-effects automobiles reflect .problems such as environmental pollution , noise pollution and the rapid depletion of fuel reserves are the talk of the day .fossil reserves under the earth s crust that have taken millions of years to form by sedimentation and organic decay are being exhausted at an alarming rate .an extrapolation from the current fuel reserves indicates that all of the present deposits will be completely exhausted in the next 50 years .then what will happen ?what about the millions of cars and automobiles running throughout the world ?will transportation come to a standstill after an estimated span of 50 years ?the answer is a no .today s world is very advanced in science and technology and this advancement is accelerating at an unimaginable pace .since primitive times , man has always invented ways and methods to enhance and improve things to fit his lifestyle the best .so will be the case now .research has already begun in finding alternatives sources of energy that can serve as a substitute for petrol and also keeping in mind the problem of pollution .man is said to have the most intelligent brain of all creatures .god has made the human brain in such a way that it can think , analyze and invent new ways that would ameliorate the ordinary present into a better future .alternative fuel substitutes such as hydrogen power , nuclear power have been a favourite topic in research labs .in fact , there has already been a launch of the first water-powered car .these improvements will continue and there wont be any decline in the number of cars after twenty years when compared to those we see now .
