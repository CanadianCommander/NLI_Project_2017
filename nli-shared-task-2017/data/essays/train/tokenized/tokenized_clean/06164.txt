its true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it is the marketing skills of the companies in making profits .most of the advertisements are so well designed and presented that they attract large part of audience .people tend to buy those products .when it comes to reality the product doesnt seem better .for example , women tend to buy various kinds of cosmetics with out actually knowing how well they suit them .so customer should be very discerning in purchasing products .its better not to be simply carried away by advertisements rather check the statistics of the product before purchasing .consulting and taking others  ( who might have already used the product ) opinion would help to purchase better products .
