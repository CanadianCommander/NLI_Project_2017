personally i am convinced that people have to try new things and take big risks if they want to be successful in our days .i am studying economics and from my lectures and from observations of today  s economy i know that you can not make much money with something that already exists .of course you could just buy something and resell it for a slightly higher price but the big money can only be earnt with something that is brand-new and everybody wants to have .a good example that proves this thesis is bill gates .he invented a completely new program for computers called windows and earnt several billion dollars with it because everybody wanted to use his new program and there was no other program of a similar kind available .because he was the only one offering such a program he could sell it for a very high price and he and his company microsoft became extremely successful , admired and wealthy .but in order to find or invent new things people have always to take risks because at the time someone invents a new product there is uncertainty about whether people will buy it or not .if the new product does not sell well , all the time and money the inventor has spent with thinking about and producing his product is lost .if the windows-programm would not have sold well , bill gates would have lost a lot of money instead of earning it .it is easy to see that big opportunities are always connected with big risks and dangers .reason for that lies in the fact that in our days the people in the western countries almost have everything they need and always expect new things .this implies that only these people can be successful who can offer them new things .
