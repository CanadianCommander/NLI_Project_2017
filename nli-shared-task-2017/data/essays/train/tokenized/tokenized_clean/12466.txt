broad knowledge on all the areas of knowing allows an individual to have intellect over many subjects , which are the academic subjects .primary and secondary schools provide a person with the basic knowledge of all the areas concerning academic subjects .however , when the individual enters an university level of education , the person starts to focus on a specific area , still making reference to others , but refering and specialazing in one area .i believe that even though this focus on an area allows an individuals to develop a career on that topic where the individual s interest is ; a broad knowledge of all academic subjects is fundamental and neccesary for the development and growth of the individual throughout its life .some of the areas of knowledge are the following : math , history , social sciences , natural sciences , and the arts ( literature , music , and plastic arts ) .for an individual to entirely comprehend world conflicts and life situations it is demanded an atleast a general comprehension of these subjects .besides the knowledge of all these academics areas enhance the comprehension of the individual towards life , it permits the creation of connections between events through reason between them and to contribute more to the society .someone does not need to be an historian or an artist to comprehend these areas , but a basic knowledge on these amiliorate any difficulty in understanding them .as a preceptor , the individual has to make use of reason and logic to make those conneccions which allow to understand , and also to create their own theories , their own conclusions regarding a topic .academic subjects are the tools given to individuals to have the start , the spark to create and make up its own criteria towards and subject , also the ability to discuss among a group of persons a topic and have basis to take and defend a stand .for example , those members that work in the united nations must have hollistic knowledge of the happenings of the world and must have the ability of recognize them , and to use all the areas of knowledge , along with the ways of knowing , to find possible solutions through the making of resolutions .even though there are the committes of human rights , e.c.o.s.o.c , disarmament and enviroment ; each member of this committe cant be stuck on only one of the subjects involved .when looking to a conflict each one of them has to have the ability to look at the panoramic view , denominated the birds view , from that of the narrow view , the ants view .this is what separates us from animals , the ability to reason , to identify a problem and search for a solution , using our most valuable tool which is our knowledge .in conclusion , to have a better comprehension of the world , of conflicts , of life the individual must have a broad knowledge of all the acaemic topics , because they are all interrelated , and this builds up the persons own personal criteria towards anything , this makes it possible for discussions between u.n. memebers concerning possible solutions towards the impovement of a better world .
