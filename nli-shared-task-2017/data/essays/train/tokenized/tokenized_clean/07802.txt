some people think that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .however , i believe students need to learn facts rather than ideas amd concepts .first of all , students can learn what they should do or should not do from facts .when they learn consequences of a certain fact , they will know that the fact should be done again or not .for example , if students learn about wars , they will know that people should not fight each other again .since students wll learn that wars cause so many deaths from the wars which occured in the past , they would think that wars are not acceptable .second , while ideas and concepts can be very complicated and difficult to understand , facts are easy to understand .for instance , when students learn the concept of `` dilemma  , they may not understand the meaning completely .however , if they learn examples of `` dilemma  , they would understand easily and deeply .finally , facts are related to real life .therefore , students can match their experience with the facts they have learnt .as a result , they can predict what will hapen next and prevent bad consequences .for example , there was a huge earthquak in japan and a lot of people died becase furniture in the house hit them .if students learn about that , they can prevent it from happning again by attaching furniture to walls .in conclusion , facts provide students with more useful information than ideas and concept does .
