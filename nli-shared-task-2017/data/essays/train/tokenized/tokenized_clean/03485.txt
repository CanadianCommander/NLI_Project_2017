i agree .young people sould spend more time to help their communities .in this essay , i would like to present my ideas about young people nowadays should spend more time to help their commnities .before arguing about this issue , the definition of `` enough  should be stated .how much work is enough ?i believe the answer should not be some actual number but a right attitude or a correct worthvalue of helping others .young people should undertand the meaning of society , the neccessity of society for human psychology and acutal needs , and how societies are constructed .once this attitude is aquired , then it would be `` enough .in past fifty years , individualizm is emphasized in most cultures .consequently , young people nowadays only care about themselves .their parents do not teach them to help others actively .the schools they go do not ask them to pay attention to the people in need .even the government spends little money on the charity agency .could one imagine what kind of soiciety wil we live in when young people nowadays become the leaders of our planet ?thus , a heart to care about others is very important .individualizm should not be understood as isolation from people .instead , it should be every one can have the ability to work individually , but also to work with others to create a better environment or society .in these two decades , some leaders of a business start to promote `` the spirit of team work .this shows that more and more people realize the importance of working as a team , in other words , as a community .each one of us is a tiny little part of a bigger unit , like a family .many families construct a comminity .many communities builds up a country .a country is simply a bigger community .to learn how to be responsible to one s country , one should learn how to be responsible to their commnity .in conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their commnities .they should spend more time to help others .it starts with developing right worthvalue and right attitude .
