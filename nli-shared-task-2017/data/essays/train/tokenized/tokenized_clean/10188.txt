when we turn on a t.v. we always see advertisements which looks good and useful to us .it is so common to see advertiseements from anywhere and it is true that advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .people know this and they know product is not that good and not needed , they try to buy this because of famous person advertising it or its fake view changes people s mind and people are greedy and advertisement use this people s mind to make there s look better than they really are .teenagers always love famous star and who they see as a roll model .even adults think they want to be like a famous star .when they see advertisement with their favorite star or roll model , it makes people to buy those things so they could be like them .this is fact true because there are many brand succeded from this advertise .product was actually same , however they changed their model for their product and they began to have a great success .this happened because many girls like this star and many boys want to be like this star .this resulted childern to go to this brand and buy things .this example tells us that eventhough it is same product , it depends on advertisement and who advertises it .people always believe what they see and believe in it .when people see advertisement in tv or newspaper , they see the products which looks and works much better than it really are .for example , there was a advertise which was about clay which stiks all things to wall and never droped even heavy things such as ballingball .this gave an effect to people to buy it because it holded heavy stuff and it could be removed easily .however when people bought this they could not even put picture on to it because it fell out so easily .this shows us that what we see in tv are things that are overacting products and it looks much better than it is .all people have greedy mind and that is just human .advertise always use this to sell and make their product look popular .in advertise they always say they are going to get sale order for 10 minutes and they will be done .however you can see this advertise next day also .but people think that they are really going to get sale order for 10 minutes and they order for it because of they want more benefit .for example , if i say to people who has not been to empire state building that ` empire state building tour will be closing in one week  , than they will say ` i should go there before it closes  .this is people s mind and people are greedy like that and advertise uses this inorder to make their product popular and good .as mentiond above , people always sees advertisement when they are living because advertisement is everywhere .people always try to do same thing as what their favorite roll model or star does and star always advertises .also what they see in tv is always over described and what they say is kind of a lie such as being saled for 10minuntes and there are only 100 product left .this is all trying to make their product look better and it makes the product look better than they really are .therefore , we should not depend on only advertisement when we are buying products .
