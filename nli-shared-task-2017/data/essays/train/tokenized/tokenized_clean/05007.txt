at present , i donate some money to the foundation of bill gates as a sponsor to be able to help aids patients who have suffered in the south africa .as we know , bill gates who is a founder in the company of microsoft established to aids foundation to spend an enormous money for the aids patients and support them to get a better life by the appropriate treatment .he is already one of the billionares in the world with a fame .however , he is turning to others  lives to help them without personal greed and seeking only prestiges .he has already got almost all things whatever he really want to achieve .however , he is not satisfied with these materialism , he is trying to turn the poor and suffering people with aids to share his wealth .i think he is the most powerful , respectful and admirable person in the world because he has a good personality to take care of others such as aids patients not just instead of caring for his business and his purpose .if he is doing very well in his own business like microsoft company , people would not say he is being success or prominent person .many people who are aroun me , they are successful and outstanding in their field such as lawyers , doctors , and bussinessmen .however , they all are trying to do new things without staying convenient situation .they try to help people who have suffered with various diseases as a free doctor and to act as a probono lawyer for the disabled .there are so many successful people in the world , most of them are usually doing decent something for others b
