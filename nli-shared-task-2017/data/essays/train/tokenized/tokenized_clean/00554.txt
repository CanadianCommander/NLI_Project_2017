`` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , i agree with this statement because young people are more enthusiastic than the older people .as it is the time for the young people to enjoy they should rock their life , cant find time to enjoy when they are old .the older people hardly find time to enjoy as they are busy with their work , thus young people enjoy their life .for example consider young people they have lot of time to enjoy with their cousins and friends , but older people meet with thier cousins when they attend party .thus young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people , while they are busy with their academics , still find time to enjoy i.e in holidays .young people get holidays after their completion of course ( i.e one or two months ) .but older people do not get much holidays to enjoy , if they for a leave they get only few day i.e hardly one week .for example , young people enjoys a lot on their holidays by going to movies , rocking with friends , attending parties and going tour in their vacation , but older cant do this as they dont find time .thus young people enjoy life more than older people do .hence considering the above points we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .thus young people find more time to enjoy their life than older people .so , young people should enjoy their life to maximum extent as they can not enjoy when they are old .
