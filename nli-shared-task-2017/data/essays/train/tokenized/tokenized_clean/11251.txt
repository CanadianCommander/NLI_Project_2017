technology has been improved quickly in the past centuries .for instance , the industrial revolution which happened in europe made the world step into another period .obviously , the improvement of technology provides the convinience to humen ; however , on the other hand , the improvement of technology brings out some harmful influences and effects to not only the humen but also the world .one of the important improvement of technology is the invent of cars .cars were made to shorten the distance between two places , and it might be the most successful invent ever .however , the polutions that are caused by car have been a serious problem for a long time .after twenty years , will cars bring us more conviniences ?or will cars cause more problems than they do right now ?fortunetly , humen have been considering the increasing of numbers of cars right now , thus , i believe in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .many governments nowadays strongly encourage people to use the public transforming system such as bus , train , or even airplane .in addition , many countries encourage their people walk and bike instead of driving .certainly , the governments have this kind of suggestions is to prevent from more polutions that are caused by cars .i believe humen around the world will soon realize the purpose of governments having these suggestions , and will stop buying cars in order to avoid more polutions that are cause by cars .another reason of why the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years is because the heavy traffic that is happening to all the big cities in moderndays .if humen are still buying more and more cars , can you imagine what will happen in the future ?the situation of traffic will be terrible for sure .in london , the goverment is taking tax from people if they drive into downtown .obviously , this policy seems to be rediculous , but i think it is a good solution to solve the heavy traffic in london .we only have one earth , and we ve been providing too many polutions already .this is the time to save the earth and turn the situation .i wish humen will consider to take governments  suggestions which were stated before in order to save the world .
