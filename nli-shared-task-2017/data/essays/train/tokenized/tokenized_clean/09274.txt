i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are some reasons that might suggest this as for example that younger people are normally more healthy then older people .of course if an old person has to use a wheelchair he is going to enjoy his life less than a younger one without wheelchair .also younger people might have less obligations and responibilities than older people .studying is assumed to be mainly fun .but this seems to be a popular illusion .today , through the advance of medicine , older people are healthier than ever before .also , today students are aware of the fact that their future depends on their success in studies .this means that they have a lot of obligations and responsibilities too .and old people can also choose a life with only minor obligations and responsibilities .actually they can live like young people .older people have made their experiences .according to their experiences they have chosen how to live .they have all opportunities like young people plus experience .young people have to spend their time to their education .they ca nt build a family for example .for most people having a family is still the most satisfying experience .also they depend during their studies on the money of their parents .older people however earn their own money .they have more money to spend and they can decide what to do with their money .another point is that enjoyment of life does not depend on age .the differences mentioned above are mainly dependant on the person .you can enjoy yeour life when you are young and you can enjoy zour life when you are old .most things you can do in both stages , like meeting friends , visiting concerts and so on .the important thing is how you take life .you are always going to face problems whether you are young or old .the decisive things is how you cope with the problems .
