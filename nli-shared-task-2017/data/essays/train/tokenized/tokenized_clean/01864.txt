is a fact more important than to understand ideas and concepts ?the answer to this question is not easy at all .for some , a student is better educated if he knows a great number of facts .for others it is better to know the ideas and concepts , for this knowledge allows you to create your own facts .this essay will analyze that ideas and concepts are more important than facts alone .facts , are information that allows a person to solve a situation or problem .they are answers to questions .for example , we know now that environmental warming today is causing the north pole to melt , that s a fact .but how did we get to that fact ?that s why facts alone should not be the most important educational element for students .in order to create our own facts or understand how information has been created we need to understand ideas and concepts .in connection to the above , ideas an concepts are important for they let us acquire knowledge of facts by ourselves .for example , if a student gets trained in advanced math , he will possibly be able to create his own math theories .in other words he will be able to create or explain facts .this evidently conforms a better education for a student .in conclusion , ideas and concepts are more important and have more educational value .a student that knows facts will not have the abilities of one that understands ideas and concepts .in this sense my personal opinion has been proved .it is better knowing how to create facts than getting the answers from a book .
