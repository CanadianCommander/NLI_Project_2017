i agree with the statement .because many young people recently do not take part in their communities .they are not interested in their communities and society .i think they do not like boring task and anything that they can not get merit .they feel troblesome and they want to enjoy doing more anyting else than helping their communities .they may not like that they communicate with anybody .now we have all information around us .
