everytime , when we turn on tv or open megazines , there are always advertisements there .in order to catch customer s eyes , the sellers do spend a lot of money to make their products looking better and even to give customors the wrong impression .first , the most common advertisements give people wrong impression is food advertisement .for example , the burger king s hamburgers are always bigger on tv and smaller in the stores .this is really disappointing thing when i decide to get a super big hamburger .moreover , we never see hamburger advertisements tell customers exact how big a burger is .we never see a store says that we will see you a 5 x5x5 cm3 big hamburger .thus , we all come happily with a hope to get a super big burger , but leave disappointedly .second , the drug advertisements always try their best to delivery population a image of how fast and effect their medication , but lack of inforamtion regard to side effects .a very good example is the great drug , viagra .when viagra just came up the market , the drug company never mentioned that patients with coronary artery disease can not take this medcation .the consequence of not telling the fully information was to put people in danger .later , durg company added the addition information when it adversed viagra .however , the strong image of rescure men s sex life is far greater than the image of dying from heart attack when patients with coronary artery disease take the comnication of viagra and their cardiac medication .thus , drug advertisements always tend to lead the poluation to ignore the side effects .in summery , since we can not avoid not to see these advertisements , we should have our own knowledage to make a decision how good a product really is and try to gain all information we need before taking a new medication .
