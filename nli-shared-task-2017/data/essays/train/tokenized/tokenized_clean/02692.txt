i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knoledge of many acadamic subject than spesialized one .one of the most imoprtent thing is time factor , so spending much time on one subjects we will me good and master at the subject .for example , in the higher level education universities offering only in perticular subject rather than on prefer in more subjects .broad knoledge will keep a person in the top in the position and every problem regading that will be solved by the person .speacialize acadamic subject will produce more bettre resulets , when the person is more intrest in that subject .for examle , in the school some people get good marks in the perticuler subjects when compare to the other subjects , at this time we will encourage him in his intresting subjects rather than other .in later years he will be master at the subject and will takes researchs in the field he will discover more intresting results in that area .let s take an example from the hestory of maths , great mathamatician pythagars , in his school days he always preffer to solve maths problem to that of other subjects like social , science .after few years he became a great mathametician , this is truly because of his broad knoledge in that perticuler subject .from , this examle we can say that the perticuler subject should his intresting subjects .so , from the several reasons and examples we can conclude that its better to have broad knoledge in one subject .
