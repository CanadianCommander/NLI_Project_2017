i support that successful people try out new things and take risks than only doing what they have already know how to do well .i believe that success , in any form gives human being a different way of thinking and doing things .success may be in any form i.e. , it may be in the form of money or fame or in any other form .this gives a man to think in a different way from the usual thinking and trying out things differently .they try to do things in a new fashion and not in the way that they have already done or in a way that they knew .there are some characteristics developed in these successful people along with the success .these successful people dare to take risks and work out things differently .for an instance , theres a difference in doing the things by a very rich man when compared to a poor man .here , success , in the form of wealth changes the thinking of the rich man and he tries doing things in a different manner .for example , the rich man goes to a very costly restaurant , clothes himself heavily , moves in a costly car and dines at different places .a middle class man can do all these acts performed by a rich man , but he does not exceed his limits .this is success in the form of wealth which makes the rich man to work out things differently .consider success in the form of fame .the highly famed people does things differently when compared to the normal people .they arrive to new ideas of working things out .in this case , due to the fame of these successful people , they dare to take risks in any form as they are famous .and if anything undesirable happens , they are backed by their fame .all the people that are successful , try to work things in a different manner and are prepared to take risks rather than doing things in the manner that they already know .their ability of thinking that they can manage the consequences of the things workedout in a different way keeps them going on doing things in a different manner .they are ready to take risks as they are successful and as they think , they can handle the situation and the results of workingout things differently .
