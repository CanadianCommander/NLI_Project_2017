this statement definitely has a lot of truth to it .i totally agree with the statement since i believe that only when one takes risks can he/she be different from others .being different from others means thinking differently than others and having unique ideas and thoughts .one is said to be taking a risk when he/she is doing something out of the ordinary with an element of uncertanity .this involves being creative , imaginative and most importantly innovative .most successful businessmen in the world are where they are beacuse they had taken a risk .they took the first step and used their artistic abilities to do something that others had not done .bill gates , the ceo of microsoft took the risk of using his ideas and investing in it to produce a useful outcome .he was greatly successful is his approach and now is among the richest people in the world .great figures in history have taken risks to achieve what they have aimed for .turning back time and looking at american history we can clearly see that the british took a big risk of entering an unconquered and undiscovered territory , which is now the united states of america .they definitely knew that they had a fair chance or no chance of acquiring what they had desired .everything in life holds risks , whether they are risks investing in shares of a multinational or buying an good from the electronic store as an investment for your own home .but , risks involved in being a successful person hold much more than that .logical thinking and one s creative abilities encourages him/her to take risks .however , sometimes taking risks can be dangerous .we should clearly evaluate the degree of risks we are about to take and state the dangers involved .risks can directly or indirectly harm an individual or the society as a whole .therefore this should be considered before attempting any risks .if everyone in this world continued to do what they already know how to do well , there would not be any developments in terms of technology , scientific achivements or even physical abilities to do something .we would be living in a fairly backward society with no room for any innovation or creativity .sometimes , we should think outside the box and take these risks which will help us to be known and will probably bring fame and make us successful .one who takes risks is more likely to be successful than one who does not .the simple reason being the latter does not believe in himself/herself and does not have enough confidence and courage to get his idea out to the world .
