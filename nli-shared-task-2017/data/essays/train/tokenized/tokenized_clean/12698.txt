this problem is wider than it appears .in fact , it has to do with a very complex reality , in which several aspects convey .surely , and i strongly believe in this : in future there will be fewer cars than there are today , and i am sure of this for several reasons .during these years , energetic problems are growing more and more .fuel is becoming , every day , a treasure .surely , this problem has to do with other parts of our reality , but it s evident that energetic problems are on the base of using a car .another aspect , for which i am sure cars will disappear , can be sumed with one only word : `` pollution  .cars produce very dangerous solutions of gas and vapour , that can strongly damage the health of men and animals .it is demonstrated the the pollution in a town is produced in great part by cars , and it is the first reason for cancers and other type of illness .the last reasons , that i use to demonstrate my thesis , have to do with the spirit of the people , and with what i see every day .people have understood that , sometimes , if we take a car to go to do something . ..well we are very stupid , because we can do it going by bicycle or on foot , and using a car is not the best because , in any case , you have to park it .when i told `` what i see every day  i was intending this : i go to milano every single day of my life , i take a train , a metro , and a bus ; i live far from my university .i see lots of people who do not use the car because they can not for money , or simply because they ve understood that it s not the best to drive in a city .ending my work , i sume everything , simply , saying that not only cars will be fewer and fewer , but they will disappear , because polluition , economic conditions and social reasons are doing it .
