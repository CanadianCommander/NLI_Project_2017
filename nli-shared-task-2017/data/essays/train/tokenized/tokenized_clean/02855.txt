i disagree with the statement that considers it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .in the following paragraphs , i will attempt to explain my position from different perspectives .in my opinion , someone who knows `` little about a lot  , will probably be unfamiliar with the specifics in each of the areas he or she knows `` a little  about .the probable outcome is that this person wo nt be able to do anything his own and will need specialists in each area to help him or her .instead , if that person were to specialize in at least one area , then people can go to the person for help on a specific matter .the person can , in turn , ask for help or advice in areas beyond his or her expertise .from an economic perspective , i think that this optimizes resources .from a social perspective , i think that this creates social interaction , since people will continue to need from each other .it also prevents mistakes .why ?because many mistakes are made by those who think they know .finally , i think that the future is tending to a world of more specialists .in day to day life , we see that universities offer very specific courses .on the other hand , we see that companies are demanding precisely that .it is no longer sufficient to be a lawyer , or a tax lawyer - for example - since some companies are looking for a specialist in transfer pricing , which is a very specific part of tax law .to summarize my opinion , i think that from an economic and social perspective and for other reasons described above , it is better to be an expert in a field than to know `` a little about a lot  .
