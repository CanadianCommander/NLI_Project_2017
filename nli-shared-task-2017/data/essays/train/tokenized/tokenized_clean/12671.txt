for me , traveling is always good and pleasant .every time i can , i go to as many places i can afford to go .but if i had to choose , there would be some points to review in order to make a decition .sometimes or some places are more likely to be visited alone , with your own itinerary .you can eat whenever and wherever you want , you can spend as much time as you want in an attraction and you are entirely free to visit all the places you like .the statements made before may seem a great idea , you are free to decide evertyting ! , but people may exceed the limits of this freedom so the whole trip can result in an unpleasant experience .when things are not appropriately planed , you may spend a lot of time in only one place and at the end you might skeep some important places that you would ve like to visit .when traveling in a group with a tour guide you have the whole trip planned and , for example , if you go to europe alone and you get so excited about the eiffel tower that you spend almost two weeks in paris , when going with a group the time to stay in such a beautiful city is a week , you have already lost a complete week that could ve been great in italy .that kind of things make the group tours more effective for long trips .another advantage of taking a tour is that you will be explaind about all the details of the places you visit .when you go alone you may not know for example , that in the mayan pyramid in chichen-itza you can draw a snake by walking around it .personaly , for short trips or trips i do with my boyfriend it s best to go alone because of the freedom of time i get to have .but if it is a long trip and i want to visit as many places as i can in a short time , a guided tour would deffinitely be the best option .
