i completely agree with this statement .it costs a lot of money to have a car especially in japan .people will find that there is no deal to use cars as transportation .this considerable reasons are cost , and other way of transportations .it is expensive to charge gasoline , because of decreasing .the place where we can get gasoline is now the stage of the war .i have read that there will be no energy fifty years later .not only that it is expensive , but also people are afraid of their future life without energy power , so am i .there are many kinds of public transportations around us such as bus , train , and air plane .it saves gasoline not to use private car .it costs about sixty dollars for a car filled up gus .on the other hand , it costs about two hundred dollars to get an air plane ticket , then we can go abroad .in addition , there are so many advantages to use public transportation .therefore , people do not have to rely on their own cars .in conclution , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because people will not be able to pay the expense , and there are other useful foot in our life .moreover , we can say that the less people to support riding own cars , the better reactions to the earth .it means that it is good for environment as well .i think there are too much cars around us .
