there are people who suppot the idea which most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and the others not support this idea .i would say that i agree with this idea that most advertisemnts make products seem much better .in following discussitons , i would like to explain the reason with some examples .firstly , in japan , i have heard news that some people died because of using to reduce weight pills .recentlly , over weigt problrem is getting bigger in japan too .many prople want to reduce thier weight in easy way .this company inported this pill from other country and advertised it all over the country .it says that some person could lose her weight 5 kg in two weeks or less than week .many people bougt it and some of them had really terrible result .i am not sure that pill was main reason of their death , but i had heard that it works to blood pressure .so some of them effected badly .secondly , i like to go restrants or bars .i can choose several kind of foods from the menu .i decide foods , because it looks so delicious and it also has great amout in good price .however , when i see the real one , sometime i am desapointed .these foods are totally defferent from menu , for example , amout of the food , taste and price .whenever i see it , i decide i will not come here agein .i understand companies need to have more profits from their products .they have to make people to want to buy .the advertisement roles important part of their profit .however , if they show their product much better than reallity , they will lose thier trust from not only customers but also their comoany assosiets .and they also lose their position in their field .finally , i would say that the advertisements should not make products seem much better than they relly are .companies make thier business in honest way .i think the more honest business the more good profits .
