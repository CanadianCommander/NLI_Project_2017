during the past ten year when the whold world has been experiencing tremendous variations in all respects , no one , more often than not , can be ignorant of such a phenomenon that whether young people or the older people are more enjoyable their life .apparently , different people hold diversified views due to their respective angles .the complex nature of the above topic requires us to consider it on a case-by-case basis .as far as i am concerned , which one has the most noteworthy advantages depends on the specific circumstances .in the following analyses , i would like to reason and point out three conspicuous aspects favoring on my own consideration : nothing but the older people are happier with their life is necessarily put in the first place .first of all , there is an only too indispensable reason worth a great deal to support my inclination , which is not far to seek : old people become more and more aware of the living standard .my grandfather is a good case in point .he is eighty-one years old but he pays more attention to his life , and arrange different activities everyday , such as playing chess , walking and so forth .this case , undoubtedly , brings me a lot of inspirations in this respect : under this circumstance , it is obvious that older people are excited with their colorful life .in addition , another reason that can be presented to develop my propensity centers on that older people are more satisfied with what they have .for this point , i can not stop but cite one of my favorite german philopers , arthur schopenhauer , ever mentioned : satisfication is medicine of a good life .on the contrary , the young people always complain life is not as good as they assumed .especially the young who just get into the society .we can build up an accurate picture of implication behind this situation .unequivocally , positive conclusion can be easily inferred from it to support my idear : satisfication contributes much to a good life .last but absolutely not least , one more perspective that bolsters to meet my proclivity lies in the fact that the accelerate development of the society , which requires young people to world hard and can not affort enough time to enjoy their life .for he standpoint , i prefer to take full advantage of statistical tools to analyze it , probing what we learn the numbers .a recent survey by sina .com , the largest portal company of internet , indicates that the average number of young people have to spend more than eight hours doing their work has risen by 87 % .as is known to all , `` no one can deny the truth behind the number .admittedly , it may be right young people enjoy their life .however , to some extent , this alone does not constitute sufficient support to claim that young people are feel more happy than older people do .to recapitulate , taking into accounts all the dimensions of the issues discussed in the aforementioned analyses , which sometimes correlate with each other to generate a comprehensive and thus more convincing conclusion , i safely draw the attention that not only can older people be aware of the life quality , but also they are more easily satisfied what they have .what is more , they have little sense of the fierce competition in the modern society .on on account can we ignore the importance of the old people .
