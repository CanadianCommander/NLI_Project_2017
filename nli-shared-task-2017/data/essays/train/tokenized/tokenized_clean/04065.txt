ideas and concepts are pretty linked to facts .facts can builtd ideas and concepts , but the reprocicity is real too .it is still the same conflict that we find between the theory defenders and the experience ones .sometimes , it is more important to understand ideas than to learn facts .for example , in history , that not a big deal if students are not able to remember each facts that occured during the last century .but , they have to understand what kind of policy ruled a country and why , in the same last century .it is the same in other fields as economics and so on .in that case , students do not have to be considered as dictionnary .there is no use for them if they can not explain why facts happened .in the other hand , students have to learn facts , because it is the only way to understand ideas and concepts and to be able to explain it .if ideas or concepts are tought in a such way that students do not have to think about them and to find a link between them , they should understand them and represent them in their own way .they have to make their own experience in order to get the meanning of the theory .finally , we can see that the more important is to understand ideas and concept and learning facts is just a road to reach this goal .to my mind , experience is best way to understand theory .but , experience is nothing without theory or we will always make the same mistakes .studies have to be made as we build our life .so students will have to learn facts for a long time i guess .
