i disagree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .because by learning the fact of something , students will really learn the experience and the knowledge .also by learning the fact of that thing , students can understand the idea deeply and clearly .when students are facing something , if student only think about the idea of that thing , students will only think about how to solve the problem .but by doing that , students will forget to think about the reason .why does it happen , how does it happen .if students learn the facts of the thing , they will get the answer , the how and why and something else .and by learning the fact of the thing , they will really learn experience and knowledge from the thing , not just do it .i have a friend who is in the yearbook team of our school .she is not as good as other students in the team because when she got a problem , she will ask the teacher how to solve the problem , which is right .but she never thinks about why the problem appear .when the teacher gave her the idea of the issue , she only follow the idea and solve the problem without thinking .by doing that , she does nt really learn the knowledge and skill .when the same problem happen next time , she still ca nt solve it .so , learning the fact is more important than understand the ideas .also , by learning the fact of the thing , students will get more chance to learn about the thing , therefore , they will get the idea of the thing easily and clearly also deeply .because they learned about it .after we learn the fact we will know the idea very easily and deeply .i have a friend who goes to art class with me .when the teacher talk about the idea of a piece of art , he always ca nt understand .that s because he does nt study for that art .he does nt know the background of the art and who the artist is and so on .so it s very hard for him to understand the art only by looking at it .so learning the facts of the issue helps students to understand the ideas and concept .after all , learning facts is more important for students than only understand the ideas and concepts .students will gain lots of knowledge and experiences by learning the facts .
