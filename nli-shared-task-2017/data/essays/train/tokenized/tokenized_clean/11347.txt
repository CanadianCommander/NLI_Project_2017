although a good argument can be made that old people enjoy life more than young people do , i think that the contrary is true .there are two reasons why i have this opinion .first , when you are young , you tend to have more money to spend than when you are older or even retired .with the age come the duties and the sorrows .when building a family , there are a lot of things such as a house and the education for the children that cost a lot .altough it may be true that young people may dispose of relatively less money , they have more to spend .so they give it out for vacations , cars , parties and other things that are fun .they sometimes even buy things that they can not really afford .without saying this is better , young people think short-term and therefore enjoy every single day .when i used to work as a trainee when i was 21 years old , i had money but no duties .so i just enjoyed going out with friends every night and spend the whole money .i do not think that i will show the same behavior by the time i get 30 .i will hopefully have saved some money to be able to plan a family .in addition to that , young people want to enjoy now and today .from my point of view , i think it is better to enjoy your life as long as you can .knowbody knows what tomorrow will be .i heard about a lot of people who were postponing their trips they wanted to take or their cars they wanted to buy , but due to several factors , suddenly it was not possible anymore .not only is it more fun to do a trip with your friends when you are young , but it is something you have done and will always think back and smile .therefore , young people travel around more when they are young just because it has more advantages than if you travel when you get older .in conclusion , despite the fact that older people have fun as well , i think that young people enjoy their lives more because they do it with less reasoning and more joy .
