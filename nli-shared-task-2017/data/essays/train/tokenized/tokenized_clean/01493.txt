i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .this is so because of many reasons .to start with , i think that facts origenate ( come originally ) from ideas and concepts .this can be clearly shown in the physics field , for example .when a person wants to prove something for somebody , through an expirement , he has to build his whole expirement on one or more idea or concept and then go on with the expirement to prove a specific fact .from this point we can understand that ideas and concepts are more important than facts .moreover , through focusing on ideas and concepts the , student will develop a self thinking method based on reasoning .this is basically done by schools and universities .when these institutions are focusing on developing and improving the student s ability to learn new facts and concepts , it is growing and feeding the student s imagination to think in a different angle of view and thus discovering nem things .but on the other hand , when schools and universities are just ( spoon feeding ) the student with ready made facts they are killing the imagination part of his thinking .after that the student will grow up and continue in his education just depending on ready facts which are in his text books .
