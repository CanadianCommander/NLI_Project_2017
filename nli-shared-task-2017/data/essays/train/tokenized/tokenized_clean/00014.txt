it is an increasingly busy life that we all , are leading today .presently the day s are such that we do nt even have time to talk to our neighbour , or as a matter of fact we are too busy to spend time for ourselves .under these circumstances it is hard to expect anybody to work for the welfare of the community or for other people .i completely agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communitiestoday s youngster s are leading a very busy schedule .in order to cope up with the pressuers of life , the person has to be multitasking .while , studying in the university , today s students are requires to work and at the same time , concenterate on studies to get best of the grades .even , for those people , who only work , the company that they are working in leaves them no time to spend for themselves .it s a global world , which is characterized by a lot of competion and only those who are willing to put their best efforts in work can survive here .although , young people are not able to do much , because of their schedules , a device has to be worked out to carry out the welfare activities .
