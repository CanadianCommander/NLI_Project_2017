the art of advertisingadvertising is one of the most influencial techniques in people minds , human has invent a weapon to control the market .many major industries expend millions of dollars in advertisment , because advertisment is what really pop up their sales .products may be good , but advertisers try to make them look better .most of advertisments only shows the qualities of products , but deffinetly they dont show the bad face of them .we are totally surrounded by advertisements , there are everywhere .the cities are full of them .almoust all products in market are advertise in differnt places .our minds are fully influenced by them .in my point of view , i agree with the statement , most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .to support this idea a perfect example is credit card comercials : if we see a credit card comercial on tv , tit might show us an incredible vacation in the himalayas or a beautifull yatch in the middle of the caribbean , so the first we imagine is us on that situation , then the next think we do is apply for a credit card , deffinetly we will be the next person in the himalayas or the caribbean , and that s not true the true is that we might have the credit card , but we cant affort the trip , we need to work harder to get the money to pay the trip , if we dont have the money to pay , we wont be able to go , and the credit card wont be as usefull as it looks .another example might be the food advertising , non of the foods you get , are as good as big or as tasty as the ones they show on the advertisments .also must advertisers are proffesionals , and they know how to manipulate producs and make the look the way people want them to look , but when people buy the products , they are totally different from what they saw in the advertisement expect .for me , advertisement industry is valid , people can make efforts triying to show the best characteristics of a product , but what is not valid for me , is that advertisers manipulate them to show advantages that the dont have .
