i belive that in 20 years the use for cars will decline because there will always be new technology , more safer ways to trave , and new fuel sources .if you look closely in history , you will see that man has always been trying to find better substitus to what he has and for that reasone people are riding cars now .for example , long ago people used to walk for transportation but thought that it was nt practical so after much looking around they started riding domesticated animals , after that they began to try and travel in groups the answer was the envention of the carages , later on they began to find other means of faster transportaion which ended in the envention of cars .it s true that cars are fast and reliable but their are not safe enough .car accidents might be extreamly damaging or fatal for that people started to make rules for riding cars like buckeling setbelts , not leting children sit up frond , and sitting in the right position .although there are rules most people wo nt go by them and try to `` do it  their way , so a safe means of transportaion must be found .in today s world fossiel fuel is the most important resource , many machines depend on them like cars , planes , and trains .if you look at my first reasone , new technology , you will see that because of it humans will find another form of fuel , like cold fussion , to use other than fossiel fuel because it pollutes the atmospher and cases diseases like cancer .in conclusion , i think that cars are going to be use less in the next 20 years becaus there will be a much safer , more hi-tech , and nature friendly means of transportaion .
