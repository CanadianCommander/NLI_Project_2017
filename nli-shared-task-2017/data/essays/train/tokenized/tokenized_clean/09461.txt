i do not agree that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  , because cars are most useful transportation today , and it is not easy to create brand new machine in twenty years , and nowadays there are more eco-cars on the roads , and car drivers care about the nature recently .the useful points of cars are that there are many road to drive and they are more than rollways or subways , and you can go close places to far places individualy .because of the good points , when you go your family trip , the car makes you more confortable , and it is easy to make your own original plans .i guess that it is easyier to make cars easy to drive and confortable spase than create new machine .some people might say that driving is too rough and make them tired .however technical skills are growing up day by day , it mat be not far futhure that you do not have to drive a car .some peole are considering the effort of cars to enviroment .they think it is good to use trains and busses rahter than your own car .however , the eco-car can slove the problems .nowadays , the use og eco-cars are rising and considering about our natures .moreover , driving car will be easy and confortable because of recently the high technical skills .from the past , the cars are the most useful machine for indivisuals and also pubric .i do not think cars use will not down , people still depend on their cars .cars will be still the most used transportation in twenty years .
