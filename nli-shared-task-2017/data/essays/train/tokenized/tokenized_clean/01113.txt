have you ever been on a bus when suddenly an old woman gets in it and nobody offered their seat ?i guess that every one who has seen it , at least one time in their lives , will agree with me when i say that nowadays young people does nt care about helping their community .rigth now it is not a normal thing to help old people to cross the street , or to offer them your seat in the bus .when i was at school , i used to go to the local hospital for working like a voluntier .i really loved !my dutties were to take care of some kids while the cleaners worked on their rooms .i spendt four hours a week playing with different kids .it was nt a hard work for me , and it was a very usefull activitty for my community .i think everyone should try to help their communities , due to the fact that they will be able to have fun an at the same time make an excellent job to help other people .because all of this they may also feel better with themselveshowever , what it s true is that in the 21th century s young people normally has a lot do .for example is pretty common for teenagers to work during the year , or to play different sports .maybe those are the reasons , but maybe what happen is that young people is becoming very selfish .if they have time to hang out with their friends i m sure they can also find time to help their communities .not to much time is requiered .you can make a lot with a  only a few hours a week .in conclusion , nowadays young people do nt give too much time to helping their communities , actually they do nothing for their communities , and this is very sad .i think schools should have kind of a subject to show kids how to help others and how to be involved in their communities .
