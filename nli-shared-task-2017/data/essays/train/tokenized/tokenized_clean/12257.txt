the statement given makes a strong assertion , that we will see fewer cars on the roads twenty years from now .this is a statement i disagree with and i will illustrate my rationale now .let us look at the possible grounds for this statement .petroleum , the current source of fuel for cars , is already facing the prospect of stock depletion .faced with ever-increasing demand ( ironically because of the increasing number of cars , among other vehicles ) oil prices have already touched 70 dollars a gallon ( a very considerable amount ) .with fuel prices this high , how much longer can people afford to buy and use cars ?also a very pertinent issue is the alarming-level of pollutants that cars spew out .marked environmental changes like increasing health risks in shangai city ( a study done very recently , in early 2006 ) , have finally brought more and more environmental lobbies and even corporations to sit up and ake notice .with cars being one of the major sources for such pollution ; how long can they continue ?the final potential nail in the venerable car s tombstone might be very real , very visible , very pragmatic issue of space !with cities ever increasing , cars are literally clogging the arteries of organised urban existance : the roads .i have observed this in all the cities i have lived in so far : from hyderabad to mumbai to guwahati in india ; from frankfurt to mainz to paris and amsterdam in europe .this problem is just as , if not more pronounced in us metropolises like new york or even detroit .with this being the case , how much longer can people even possibly drive cars ?that is the present situation ; but its not a dire one .man , being the persistent , ever innovating construct that he is , is very really circumventing these very issues .petroleum is increasing in cost ; yes .but no longer is petroleum the only viable source of fuel for cars .already , new sources of fuel ; from hydrogen cells to solar energy : from nuclear energy to most importantly , electrical energy are being harbored as sources of fuel for cars .in my institute of study , a lot of work is being done on this very issue and we especially look at the protius in the us or the smart cars in japan , where petroleum is no longer used .with such potentially limitless new fuels ; cars are still going to live on .another fantastic characteristic of these new fuels is their harmony with nature ; the lack of any real threats to our environment .this only reinforces their role as pragmatic lifeblood for the automobile .the roads today are being choked up ; yes .but what are we doing ? , we re building more .its amazing to note that the top 10 civil engineering marvels of the modern age are either road networks , or bridges ( like the one at shanghai airport ) .we are countering this threat of traffic in new and wonderful ways .a lot can happen in twenty years , but certainly not as much as this statement asserts .frankly , when i was a kid , i thought we would actually be living like the jetsons now : but thats obviously not the case .before a day dawns when we buckle under the weight of our own contrivances ; before a day dawns when urban networks utterly degenerate into bedlam because of critical mass ; man will most certainly have contingency upon contingency .maybe a time will come when cars are no longer pragmatic at all .but not within twenty years .as the points i have made above assert ; i truly believe that cars will still remain on the roads twenty years from now .
