the population is not determined in two cathegories , the successful and non-successful .hopefully , there is many variety of people between those two catergories and social ranks can by climbed .a person may be successful during a period of his life and then for the rest of his life become non-successful .today , many people that can be called ` successful  have accomplished this by taking risks such as donald trumps that risks to loose its fortune everytime he finance a new project .howerver more common people have archive their ` successfulness  by taking risk such as my neightbor that has come to the united state in order to get a better futur .not only has he accomplished that , but by risking everything to come to the usa he has now became a successful buisness man .other people have taken risk but hve accomplish nothing .that prooves that bieng successful is not about taking risk but also thinking wisely .for example , a mathmaticien might on day decide to quit math even if it is what he does best and to becom an artist .maybe he will becom well know and will becom ` successful  .at the opposit a tumandous violon player might choose to stay with violon during its life and not change to the piano .the violonist will gain internal recognition weather if he decided to become a pianist , he might have ended up a a mediocre player .if people had chosen not do do what they did beast , what would the world be today ?bill gates might have decided not to go in electronic and so , micosoft would not have existed .maybe great poeple such as monet , o keef , picasso would never have become artist .ben franclin might have been an merchand and jhonny depp an electician .however with ` if  you can redo the world .no one knows what would have happened if all those succeful peoplehad taken a risk and nver did what they do the best .being successful is not about taking risk or not , it is about having goals , determination and fate .without those qualites no on can ever become successful , for they will let go at any difficulties they encounter .
