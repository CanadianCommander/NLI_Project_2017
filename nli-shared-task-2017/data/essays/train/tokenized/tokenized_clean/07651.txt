i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time for community service and i do not attribute some change in the youngsters character that has brought this undesirable contribution towards their society .my parents give numerous examples regarding their participation in the betterment of the community and i always feel that iam unable to do as much as they did .not only me , all the youngsters of present age are unable to allocate sufficient amount of time for their community .this may be because of many reasons .firstly , because the present day life is like a race .the competition has been increasing day by day and only the strongest and efficient can survive .in this race the youngsters are not finding enough time to serve the society .secondly , the modern day student has a lot of things to do ; he has a lot to learn within the time .he has to take care of not only his academics but also exta curricular activities .this makes clear that he has less time for other things .for example i had to attend the computer class and also music class which were compulsory for all in our school .moreover the concepts what my parents learned in their times , iam learning them at an early age .so the complexity has increased and requires more time to understand .we do community service in the short time we are having .we celebrated all of our friends  birthdays in the final year of my undergraduate school in an oldage home where we could help them to some extent .so i think it is logical to say that the present generation yougsters are contributing less time to serve the society than the earlier generation .it is not because we are not willng to do do but we are forced to some other things .
