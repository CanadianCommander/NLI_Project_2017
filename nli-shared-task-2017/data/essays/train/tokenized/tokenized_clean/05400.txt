advertisements , the truth or false exaggerationsnowadays advertisements make products seem perfect and without any flaws .but do these advertiements actually show the product s true quality and worth ?recently i saw an andvertisement of a soap product that said that the soap would kill millions more bacteria and germs as compared to other soap products when used .it stated that it contains certain chemicals , which had long and very `` flashy  names .howewer this was not an exact detail , as even sunlight can destroy millions of germs and bacteria .later out of curiosity i checked the ingredients on the wrapper , and i saw that the ingredients were actually the same in almost every soap product of the similar type .another example is present within a soft drink company in india .several official reports stated that the product contained alarmingly high levels of pesticides , while the company continued to broadcast an advertisement which said that the drink had 0 % pesticides and was perfectly safe for human consumption .another advertisement was once brodcasted about a stock market fund .it stated almost nothing about the risks involved in the investment , but only a very fine print at the bottom saying `` this investment is subject to market risks , please read the offer document carefully before investing  .the only thing it showed was celebrities saying that they would invest in the fund as they felt it right .this is only a few of of many examples that a lot of people experience .the truth is that the producers or the advertising co. only want their product to be sold , irrespective of the truth about the producthowewer this does no mean that all advertisements lie about their products .certain advertisements not only state the plus points about their products , but also the negative things , such as side effects , risks etc .to conclude it can be said that , in the end it only depends on the consumer s judgement to choose the product wisely and not fall for the exaggerations made by advertisements .
