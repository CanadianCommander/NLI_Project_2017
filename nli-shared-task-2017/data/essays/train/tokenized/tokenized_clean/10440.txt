those who consider having a trip by a tour guide is the most comfortable way to travel .however , i think , it is better for us to take a trip by ourselves .there are two major reasons .first , having a trip by ourselves helps us to have self-realization .some people might say that it is possibe to feel self - realization in that they made it following by a tour guide .however , what matters is not by following others , but performing by ourselves .as society is getting more complex , the competition is getting more fierce .thus .the role of being reader has changed .it was just to plan for a daily life in the past , but now it is to organize and perform alone .also , there is not denying that being a reader is more important to survive in dog-eat-dog society .for example , i took a travel by myself wthout a tour guide .even though my parents worried about it because they thought it was quite dangerous , so they suggested me to follow a tour guide .by taking a trip without any a tour guide , i can not only organize my schedules , but also have my own free time .if i had to follow what the tour guide say , i would be stressed out due to dirctions from the tour guide .in this way , take a trip in a group led by a tour guide is not desirable for us .moreover , when it comes to the money , it is better for us to take a trip without a tour guide .it is generally agreed that we spend a lot of money while we take a trip .for example , we have to get accomodations for sleep and pay for the transportation fee and so forth .in my opinion , .getting a tour guide is the waste of money , we can not only buy some sourvenirs for our parents of friends , but also get a the fancy restraurants instead of paying for a tour guide .let s assume that the two students who travel in europe with same money .the one student takes a trip by himself .thorough enough money , he can pay anything what he wants .on the other hand , the counterpart joined to a group for following a tour guide .due to the fee for getting a tour guide , he can not do many things what he wants , just he had to follow what the schedules were fixed in the list .who can have more fun with enough money ?i can definitely say that the latter regrets that he joined to a group for following a tour guide .from having more fun with freedom to not spending a lot of money for getting a tour guide , there is nothing better than taking a travel by our selves .to sum up , i do not agree with the statement that being a member in a group led by a tour guide is best way .this is because , by taking a travel by ourselves , we can have self-realization and save some money instead of paying for getting a tour guide .
