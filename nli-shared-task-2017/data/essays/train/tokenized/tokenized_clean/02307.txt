i believe that is better to have a strong knowledge about a specific subject , rather than a superficial and wide one of lots of academics themes .i m going to explain my reasons using a personal example : my academic choice .in italy there are two types of universities :- one type is for the students that have a clear idea of what they want to do in their lives .if you study medicine , that means that you want to become a doctor ; if you study law , it means that you want to become a lawyer ; - the other is for the people who does nt know exactly , or at all , what to do .for example , science of communication gives you broad knowledge about many subjects : literature , psychology , business , art etc ... , but does nt prepare you for anything in particular .i chose to study public relations , which is very similar to science of communication , because i did nt know exacly what i wanted to become .well , at the end of my carreer , after my graduation i asked myself :  and now ?i realized that having lots of knowledge about nothing is absolutely useless .i had many interviewed , but i did nt exacly know what i wanted from that job .the truth is that i did nt know anything specific .this is why i decided to force me to understand what i really wanted to do , and , once i realized that i wanted to work in events , i applied for a master , that would ve gave me all the knowledge and the competence i needed to face the real world .i think that all the high schools should help more the students to understand which is the best job for them , not to make the mistake that lots of people do : attending a university random , that gives general knowledge , but nothing concrete .
