the student has studied lot of subjects in the school stage .i belive that the it is the better to student have the knowledge in academic subjects while you are choosing the specialization in one spocific subject .because if the student does nt have the knowledge of the specialization .he will not under standing any thing .he will face the problem in the futher .they have the better knowledge to choose the specialization because the student has to know that if he choose that .what will be the gain to get .in the form of like jobs , like proffesionals .if the student choose the write way to choose the specialization that students will sucess in a great way .because he know about the subject and he know that what is advantages .if we take for example the student studied if the is good in maths he will choose the mpc in the inter .after inter the student will do eng in the college he will choose the the specialization cs means he is good in the computers .he will good for the computers jobs .if the student is good in the science in his school stage he will choose the bpc inthe inter .he write the emcet if he collified in that he will bacome a doctor .inthat he choose the specialization for that .if the student is good in the social he will choose the cec in the inter after like to do degree and some one like to do the mba program .means the student has the knowledge to which subject is better to me and the student should think that which one is sutiable to my profile .first the student will decide and take the step other wise the student will suffer in the future .the student have the knowledge for academic subjects than the to select the specialization it is the better way to student for sucess in the life .
