i am agree on this statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects  .as per my view looking at present days scinario , it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects .as science is in a phase of revolution and todays necessities that people should to have an interdisciplinary person .another point is that using multydimensonal approach to solve any problem .firstly , now a days it s time for revolution and renovation .since , time is changing and we are in 21st century , so we have rebuild many concept because todays the science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition .we have also to find out some answers of many questions which are not solved yet .therefore , we have to be gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas .secondly , we should try to get enroll in various new and intradisciplinary subjects .here i want to say that at present time s need that we should try to get admisson in various new subjects and it s much better to take an interdisciplinary subject .by studying an interdisciplinary subject , we can gain a knowledge of a variety of subjects .for example , applied sciences can provide a vast knowledge of various subjects , which we ca nt get from any specialized subject .another example may be of bioinformatics , where we learn and read various subjects as biology , computersciences , information technology , maths , stats , physics and chemistry .so that i think this type of students can work much better and can handle various types of problems .thirdly , multydimensinal approach can solve some critical problems .present time it is a very nice idea to be an multidimensonal person .for example , in any research institute s theres a problem which involves physics , mathmatics and biology , then here is a proplem that not any person knows all the things so here a person having multisubjects knowledge can do well .so that we can make a model and can solve a problem without any problem .therefore , i can say on the basis of these some points that it is better to have a knowledge of varivous subjects .means jack of all tra
