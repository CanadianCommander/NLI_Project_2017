most products , regardless of their brand names , depend on advertisement as a main means of promotion .the question is : are these products as good as they seem ?some of those products have been in markets , and people have been consuming them for long now .these products have been able to maintain their quality and thus their name has survived until these days .we still even repeat their brand names , which proves that quality has outdid any role of advertisementon the other hand , some new products have emerged , and manufacturers have tried their best to draw a resemblance between different products .nowadays , if you are watching a commercial on tv , you can hardly notice the difference between products .they look the same , the way the product is introduced would also sound familiar to you .for example , in their commercials , they depend on showing the best of this product by getting it featured by a good looking model !once the audience view the commercial , he / she would temptingly go and try out the product .but the problem that we are facing nowadays is that some products are not as good as they seem .tv , newspapers , computer , and other means have facilitated some ways to make all of these products look just perfect !so people would go , buy or try some of these products , and later get disappointed by the results or the outcome .in my own opinion , i think that there should be certain committees to be held responsible for the quality of any product , especially when it comes to advertisement .they should make sure that the quality of products would look as real as it seems !technology has a major role in making these products look better , but definitely it should not determine our judgment , insult our intelligence , or deceive our eyes !
