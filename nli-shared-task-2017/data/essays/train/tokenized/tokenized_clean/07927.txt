i agree this satement .people always try to do the things they alredy know how to do well .but that can not make people more creative or be more successful .if people do not try the new things how can they know their `` true  ability .we can see lots of successful people talk about their experiments .if they always do the the things they know they can be the present them .just as an actor , he can not always preform the same style of movie .therefore he can be styled by the auddience .the auddience will know that `` that is the limitation of his prefromance .if the person always do the same thing that he already can do well , he wo nt get any growth of himself .because he wo nt know what s wrong or where he shall change .or what can make himself better .sometimes , i would limited by this thoughts .i just want to do what i can do well .i have no confident to do the other things that i do not famliar with .by that way , i can not learn other knowledge that i do not know .i think japanese is the good example for the successful people or the race always try new things .they make lots of new products that can connect with life .and the company like `` 3m  , the company make the product like `` post-it  .they try new things that the common people wo nt even think about .they make money by they can take risks .before make the products , they wo nt know if everyone can adapt those products .but they want to try about it .they want to make new things that everybody do not see or hear before .that is way i agree about that successful people always try new things and take risks .just because they can see the profits or commercials in it .if people not try new things , they will be limited by themselves .they can not know where is their extreme .
