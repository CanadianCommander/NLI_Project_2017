i disagree with that .i think understanding ideas and concepts , and learn facts are conected togather i am going to support my opinion by saying seveeral reason .first of all , as huna beens we have to live the the fact to understand the ideas and concepts .in fact , it is not a conditonal rule , but it is the common thing to be a human been .second , when people learn any thing , they have to do it in the real life to feel it and how can it effect his life .my third reason is , the people imgination be come larger and get more experments in their live .also they would be able tomore creative and make new things that they felt it is important for the people live , and that is going to be by living the fact that had learn it and understood it .if thedo some thing on the real live , and they have seen some thing like it on television like poorness or to be hungry , they will be sorry for the people who have these problems , but when they do it on real they help them because they felt the painful that these people are going through .these are my reasons that i thing the are very reasonable and if every school is going to do it , it would be so helpful for the teachers and very effectable for the studint life and imagination in this live .
