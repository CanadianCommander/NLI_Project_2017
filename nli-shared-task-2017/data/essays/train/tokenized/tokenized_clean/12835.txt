i agree with the statement young people do not give enouh time to helping their communities .actually young people do not have enough time to helping their communities .the examples and reasons are as follows .firstly today young peolple are busy with their schedules .every young person running along with the clock to survive in this busy world .people are working hard to acheive their goals because of day by day population is increasind and also competition is increasing .young people are totally exhausting their energy for their carriers itself .there is no extra energy to help communities .some of them are not having enough time to work for themselves .for instance , today many young people surviving by their own without creating problems to their parents .students are working while they are studying .some students hardly fine time to study because of their work .this is the main reason why young people are not having time to helping their communities .in addition to that , now a days education is so much stressed that young people have no time to look upon communities atleast those young people even dont know that communities are search for help .today schools are giving lots of home work to do that these young people are not in position to do other activities .like students employees also having same problem with their work .today many companies not considering the time that the employees work .they want the amount of work .they are imposing the work on employees .i have an real example for this statement .my elder brother is working as a sofware engineer .in his companie s policy they have holidays on saturday and sunday .but my brother used to go to the office even on sundays also because of the amount of he have to do .by considering all the above reasons and examples i conclude that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
