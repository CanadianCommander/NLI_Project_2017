some people agree that young people enjoy life more then older people do because of vast energy that young people have , while some people claim that age is not important for enjoyable life because every part of life has its own enjoyement .after consedering this question , according to my age and personal view , i agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .first of all young people s physical condition provide them to make different kinds of sports such as snow-boarding , squba diving .therefore i believe that young people can have more exciting hobies .they can travel or explore different places so i advocate that it is the very important part of good life .additionally young people s energy help them to reach their goals easier they can work harder and can obtain greater career .secondly mental tireness makes older people to lost motivation or expectation from the future .young people has energy to try to solve problems or put up with them .thus i advocate that this energy is the foundation of having enjoyable life .last but not least while individuals are young they have a temptation to taste different food or to meet different people .for this reasons happiness and enjoyement are directly linking age and this temptation .all in all i agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because young peple including myself have more energy in terms of mental or physical .
