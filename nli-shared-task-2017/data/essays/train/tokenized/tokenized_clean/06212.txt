the statement is in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .one group of people agree with this statement and one group of people donot agree with the statement .i find many reasons for not agreeing with the statement .i personally donot agree with the statement .yes , technology is developing day by day but this does not necessarily mean that there will be no cars in twenty years .this is unpredictable .now a days people are working hard and are making their lives comfortable that is they are acquiring everything they need .what makes life more comfortable ?the answer is having more luxuries and having more comforts .people are more concentrating on luxuries which includes mobiles for communication , vehicles that is cars , bikes for transport , own houses for living and so on .so people buy vehicles bikes , scooters , cars etc .most luxurious of all is car .not only luxurious , it is safer than many other vehicles .so buying cars will definitely increase that is there will be many cars in use in twenty years .these reasons donot support with the statement .secondly , people are trying to reach the goals above their standards .for example a person using a two wheeler vehicle , even though it is hard for him to buy a car , keeps his goal of buying a car due to various reasons .some of them are for avoiding pollution and accidents .they feel having a car is far better than having other vehicles .the main reason is car is affordable .and moreover now a days cars with electric facilities ars available that is having gas engines .this is safer because it doesnot lead to pollution .therefore , using cars is day by day increasing .for all these reasons which are discussed above , i donot agree with the statement that fewer cars will be in use than there are today .i strongly believe that there will be no attrition in the use of cars in twenty years and there will be more number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
