i am completely agree with this following statement ; it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .but learn facts it is also important first of all , i think that the student need to understand ideas and concepts in order to develop is intelligence and permit also to have thinking more advanced than to learn fact without understand .for example in professional life the student will be need to understand ideas and concepts .in fact , the firm need employee with thinking , a employee to be able to understand the environment , the consumer in order to find solutions , to resolve problems moreover , in private life , we need also to understand ideas and concepts for every events in you life .for instance , when you have a children ask him about a question you are able to answer more easily .or when you have a problem in order to resolve him you must to understand before .to sum up my idea it is more important to student to be able to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because in the private life and professional life society need people with reflexion about a various subject .however , learn fact it is good for the memory of the people , that s with student must to work in this two ways ; understand ideas and concepts and learn facts .for example , learn facts it is good for the culture and the history .in fact it s good to understand the history but its very important to learn facts in order to don t forget the date , events ...to resume my idea it is very important to understands ideas and concepts for the reflexion students but learn facts it also important sometimes for the culture or history in order to the student do nt forget the history and for the memory
