yes i agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than older people .well , i agree with this topic because young people are very energytic , enthusiastic and can enjoy to the fullest where as old people can not do that as their body is not as active as a young persons , perhaps it can not be as active as a young persons .it can not be as active as a young persons because it is now that that old persons body needs to take rest because he has been enjoying allmost all the time when he was young .for example :young person : a , old person : b ; a is aged between 20 to 25 years and he has gone to a disco tech to party with all is friend an he has enjoyed continuosly for 4 full hours .and then b also goes to that same disco tech and he could not even dance for 1 hour .well , the difference between the 2 is that a is still a young person and he is very enthusiastic and energytic to dance and party all night where as speaking about the old person that is b is an old man and he can not strain his body .if he does he will get exausted .his body will run out of energy .if he wants to dance like a did then he should be having lots of energy and enthusiasm .there fore i conclude by saying that young people enjoy life more that old people .
