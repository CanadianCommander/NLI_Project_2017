i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .our world is chaging very fast .there are so many amazing stuffs in the world .and i think that young people have more chances to use these stuffs such as electornic stuff .and i would like to give some specific reasons why i think like that .first , older people usually do not know some new technology products well .even they do not understand what these product is and how to use these new technology stuffs .the world is changing very fast so if you do not know these new tech products , you can not enjoy your life more than young generation .for example , when i went to a mall , my mother said to me `` what is this ?that was mp3 player .nowadays , all most of the music are made by mp3 plie .so if you do not know mp3 player , you may lose your chance to listen music which you want to listen .second , our world is making something new constantly .everyday , new things are generated because many people wants something supprise .and , usually , young people recieve something new stuff better than older people do .young people usually can understand how to use these new thing .for example , when i traveled to japan with my parents , we went to a japanese restaurant .at that time , i had to order everything for my parents because i tried to everything to order .i did not feel shy because i was young .so i used english , my arms , and my face to order .why i was able to do like this because young people has spirit of try .
