i do agree with the satement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , because iam a teenager of this generation .but if i would be a old generation teenager i would would think about this statement , i have a reasonable reasons for both of them which are explained below .if iam a teenager of this generation i would strongly agree with the staement , because this generation is a well forward generation than aprevoius one , a lot of changes had came in this generation , the techonology is very much developed so as the minds of the people esspecially teenagers .they are well matured and knows about the outer world much better than the old aged people in this generation .they really enjoy the things much better than a old age person do , because they are well aware of all the consequences about what they are doing .for example , think of a student who tries to dirve a car in avery small age but his father is worried about him but he knews the consequences of it and drives a car which he enjoys a lot while driving .but if iam a previous generation tenneager i would really think of it because the envoirnment then was not as today where we cant find a place to enjoy a lot .the main reason behind that is there no development at that time in many areas .and taking in view of old aged people they dont seems to enjoy more as the teenagers or young people do because , they are bound to there family and responsibitlies , which make them to look after all the family matters and they hardly have a time to enjoy the beautifull world .the old age people dont notenjoy a lot but they help their children do that .the young people doesnot have any soght of pressure on them such as family matters , bussiness and so on .so they can enjoy a lot where as a old age person can not .on conclusion , i strongly agree with the stament because of the above provided reasons and examples which imples the statement .
