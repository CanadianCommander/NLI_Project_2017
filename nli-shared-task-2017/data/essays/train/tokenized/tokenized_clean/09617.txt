i agree with this statement `` in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .this might be due to increase in population , high traffic and hike in fuel costs .in current scenario , petrolium products costs are increasing rapidly .by comparing costs of the same for past 5 years , rates are increased almost double .this will influence more than any other factor to people to opt for other means of transpotation .and some people might get think of frequent traffic jams during peak office timings , and find other means of transportation .from my practical experience i can strongly say that this is very serious problem to think off as i got late to my office , mainly for inportant presentations .other factor which we ca nt avoid is increasing in population and roads ll get conjusted .this case it will be difficult to find a place to construct new roads in main traffic areas .even it ll be little difficult to government to displace the people , who lived nearby main roads to some other place in case of widening of roads .from other positive side , since all metro cities are opting for mts ( mass transportation system ) , people can easily change their means of transportation andcan avoid having cars .and other way to forget cars is by staying in a walkable distance to their working places and other important activity places .as a conclusion by considering all the mentioned difficulties in current trafic problems and advantegaes in mentiond solutions to avoid traffic , cars may get reduce in next 20 yrs .
