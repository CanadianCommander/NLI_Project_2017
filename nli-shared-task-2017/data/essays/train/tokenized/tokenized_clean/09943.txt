i think it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .students need basic knowledges first .furthermore , students will use knoweldges more often rather than only ideas or concepts .finally , it will be easier to understand ideas and concepts when the students have enough knowledge and facts .first of all , students should be logical first .students are on the proccess of being mature and completed .humans will not become mature or knowledgeble if they do not learn facts .in my opinion , a person get sufficient facts ansecond , students will use knowledges more often rather than use ideas or concepts .for example , there are lots of assignments which the students are required to do .the most of assignments are about researching and analyzing something .even if a student who is lack of facts knows many ideas and concepts , he will not get high marks .it is a very obvious fact .not only in the school , but also in the future when he get a job and work in the company without facts and knowledges , he will get into troubles .finally , when they have sufficient knowledge and facts , they can understand ideas and concepts easily .for instance , a student tries to understand a concept of democracy .if he has knowledge about democracy , it will be much easier to learn what is democracy .therefore , that learning facts is much more important for students rather than understanding ideas and concepts .it is due to the fact that students need knowledges first , that knowing facts will be much more usefull rather than understanding ideas .also , when they have enough facts and knowledges , it is easy to understand concepts and ideas .i do not mean that ideas and concepts are unconditionally wrong .however , facts will be more usefull when the students complete their projects or when they work in the society in the future .
