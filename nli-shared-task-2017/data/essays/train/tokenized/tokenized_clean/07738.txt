i agree with this statement because in the world it is demostrated that people who have obtained success and have important results is what have done different things in their life and have taken several risks .this is the case of presidents , scientists , business people and other .i think a successful person is those whose performs differents activities in orde to fulfill a dream and takes advantage of new opportunities every day .for example , the mother teresa of calcuta was a successful person because she did things that other people of her same congretation never had tried to do .she peformed diverse things to fulfill her goals in her life and took many risks including her explusion of the catholic church .she understood that if she wanted to help poor people she had to perform any activity that nobody in her church had done before .another example is thomas edison , he tried his experiments 2.000 times and every day he performed the activities he was convinced were needed .nobody told him how to perform and how many times should his experiments needed to be performed .made what was planned and he fulfilled his goal of created the lamp .if edison had not decided to do different things and take the risk of a possible separation of his wife , because she did not like his experiments and the `` waste of time repeating the same thing  , the humanity would had to wait a long time before have the lamp .this examples demostrated that a person can be successful if decide to try new things and take all the necessary risks in order to fulfill the dreams and the goals .in summary the most important this for the success is living in constant change and evolution .human being needs to create every day , take advantage of the opprotunies and be aware that every great and important activity includes a risk .a more risk more yield we can expect .
