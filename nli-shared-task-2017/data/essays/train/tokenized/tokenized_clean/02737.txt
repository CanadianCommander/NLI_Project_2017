i can not imagine the world with fewer cars in use than there are today .if you think coldly , the cars manufacturing market is strong and powerful , where thousand of people around the world work thanks to the automobile field .i could mention several answer to analyce that it could be impossible to do it .aspects such as unemployment effects , decreasing the economy , aspects concerning poblation , or improving the technology , will be the reasons to not permit that in the future will be fewer cars that there are today .firstly , one of the causes that i do not agree with this statement is because , the poblation is increasing in huge paths .families have more children than years ago , so in the short time of future , the new generations will need more cars and automobiles to drive to school , back to work or going vacations .secondly , as a businessman , and concretely as a salescar , i do not agree with this question beacuse , my compay will laid off me , and could be great quantity of co/workers as like out of the office .this reduction of employers would be an absolutly brankcroupt at the cars business .everyone knows , that nowadadays , that cars conmpanies such atoyota , bmw , or mercedes are doing a good job researches new fuels and other system of managing .technology is going fast so we need students to work in investigations researches to maintain the use of cars .in conclusion , in my view threre are several aspects to trust that in the twenty years there will be the same cars or more than now .the car world business hire a lot of people around the world , from the person who design prototype s until the salesman like me .also , the number of poblation each day is in continuining expansion , so everybody needs car to go to differents places , and of course , techonolgy will offer new types to manage the news car .please , if disapear the benefits in sales in cars , i will be an unemploy .
