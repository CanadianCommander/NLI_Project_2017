when we come out the ideas we can creat the ideas and and the concepts .since that we must care about the facts .as far as i am concerned , i am strongly disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lean facts .first of all , in real life , facts include many unfornseen troubles .the diffical facts will become valuable experience .they will tell us how to do it and what we need to do .the hard facts will allow us to endure hard times in the future .it also provide many information for us to think deeper and more close to the real life .secondly , facts is very important in the real life .even you can realated the ideas and the concepts , you can think that as well as you can , you still need to care about the facts .if the facts in the real life did nt work very well .no matter the ideas and the concepts is well , the facts also play an important part in the real life .third , facts state the important position between the ideas and the concepts .the facts can let the ideas and the concepts go through fluquently .without the facts , all the ideas and the concepts is empty .the facts will let people think deeper and more comprehensive .it provide a broader range for for people to explore it by themselves .all in all , i strongly state that for people to learn facts is more important for them to learn or understant ideas and the concepts .facts is so important that it play an very important position in the real life .it connect the ideas and the concepts to make it into real .
