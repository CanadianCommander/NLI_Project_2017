it is often said that only doing what we already know how to do well is safe and stable way without risks .however , if i were asked to tell my opinion , i would recommend to try new things and take some risks because it will provide us with new opportunities , betterment of performance , and increase of lives  quality .to begin with , trying new things gives us new opportunities such as a new achievement which was never explored before .for example , if bill gates had not dropped out his school and worked as a normal salary man , what do you think would have happened ?i ca nt imagine the presence of windows , which bring us high benefits in our daily lives , without his challenge and braveness toward his vision .his success on business is based on his try .secondly , a company can survive and flourish with new ideas .samsung is well known for semiconductor business .when other competitors are satisfied with 4m flash memory chip , samsung made a big decision to develop 16m flash memory .even though there was a big risk , the revenue and value of samsung drastically increased after they launched new flash memory .then , it has been able to lead the semiconductor industry by trying new things and developing new products .finally , trying new things is able to give us new perspectives and progress .in my case , i was quite satisfied with my job several years ago .my salary was not low , i had been appreciated quite well .however , i started feeling that my knowledge and experiences were getting limited , and it seemed i was not progressing any more .so i determined to shift my job .as i tried to find new and better job , i realized that i acquired new perspectives to the business field and increased the value of myself .now i am eagerly excited about my future life even though there might be risks .all things considered , trying new things will enable us to meet new opportunities , maximize the performances , and live with better quality of life .
