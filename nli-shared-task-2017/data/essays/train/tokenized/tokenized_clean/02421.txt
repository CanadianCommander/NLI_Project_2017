i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because when people just focuses on what they have learned from school , and think it is right , they do not open their mind to new experiences wich can not be good for the things they are working on .for example , when it comes to technology , people must change or improve the ways of doing things really fast , so there can be better development ; without trying new stuff there would not be advance .trying new things is important for success because it improves the experience of the person in some facts .taking risks is also important for success .for some people , taking risks might be bad due to the possible negative outcomes their work can get , but taking risks is the only way people can livet new experiences and improve in both working and personal life .taking risks is the only way people can prove if what they are doing is right or wrong , if it is right they can keep it , if it is wrong they learned from it and can improve it .when combining trying with risk , success is more likely to happen , but before really doing something with this two factors people should learn a bit a bout the situation they will work on , this way they can plan better what they will do .a good example of successful people are leaders , they must always hear and analize the ideas of the people surrounding them .all those new ideas become things to try that might be positive and improve the work they are doing .leaders review the ideas , pick one or combine them , and then try it .also , when deciding what to do , they must take risks so the they can really achieve their goals .without risking they would not know what to do and just stick to the normal parameters that might not be good for their work .all the people should open their mind to the new stuff , try different ideas and risk a lot to achieve their goals .sticking to just one learned thing is not always positive because not everything works the same .
