nowadays , the development of communication makes the working at home possible .that might be a reason that some people say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , i disagree with it .the reasons will be shown in the following .modern people regard private life as important .in other words , they love to enjoy life , and car is necessary to do so .in my parent s generation , it was common to buy home earlier than car .however , people of my generation tend to buy car first when they get jobs .therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will not decrease .in addition , there will be enough energy to spend in the future .although there are not enough fuels in land , there are still huge oils and gas in the ocean .moreover , the automobile that can be operated by electric energy was invented .it is just being advanced to be used by people .finally , there are many countries that are still developing .for example , china , the country in which a major population of the world is living , is developing dramatically .it is necessary that the number of cars in china will increase .in addition , there are many countries that are developing like china : india , russia , brazil , etc .in conclusion , the number of cars will not decrease in twenty years .the importance of private life is increasing , and there are enough fuels and many developing countries .for these reasons , i believe that there will be more cars in use in the future .
