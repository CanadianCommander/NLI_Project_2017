ideas and concepts are based on assumptions and historical moments , however facts are real and most of the time scientificly prouved .i believe that to understant a fact you need to understant ideas an concepts that take you to that fact .for example , in politics it is important to understant ideas and concepts of the diferents parties to understant their way of doing things .the main idea of communisum is to share everything and have the same level of life with the same opportunities .however , communist gouverment such as cuba show that there is not a equal situation and in fact the goverment manage everyting and people are not free to do whatever ther want .the cubain communisum show that there is a different between the concept and the fact .it think it is important to learn the concept and illustrated with real facts allows student to havea better understanding of the situation .furthermore , ideas and concepts are the base of a fact , that is why it is a logical process for students to learn ideas and concepts to be able to understant facts .for example the monarchy in spain , people respect the monarchy system because they understant the concept which make part of their identity .they know the background of the country and they the fact that they made part of the country history .but to understant that , you need to know the background of the country and to know what is the concept of the monarchies in other to be able to understand their position toward the spanish people .
