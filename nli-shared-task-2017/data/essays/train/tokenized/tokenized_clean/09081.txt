new idea = success ?the most successful ideas are new and never seen before .almost all people are attracted by things they do not know yet .so by following new ways of thinking you can become a successful person .i agree with this statement , as new ways of thinking can help you to be successful in some situations of life .starting a company is a high risk .in order to be successful in an economy you should really have thought of an idea no one has had before you .especially , if you want to sell things , new ideas may help you to make your good more attractive to people who would buy it .if you would try to sell something everyone does already have , you will have a bigger problem .so you must make yourself special , what mean that you have take new ideas apart from what you already know into consideration .another great example are internet companies that convince people to by things they used to by at normal shops , even food or cars , via the internet .new comunication forms , such as specified formus , have come up .now the founders can get rich by selling their internet sites .but there are other parts in life where you can be successful with a work that is known and you can do well .for instance , building up new friendships or partnerships , as well as social engagement .for these kinds of `` jobs  it is not important that you earn any money or make profit .here people can be successful in this way that he or she is satisfied and happy with their life .this would be a definition of success where i can not completely agree on the statement .the of couse you have to be really good at your job and better as everyone else .this is the point where new ideas may help you to stick out of all other people again .all in all the conclusion is that if you want to be successful in an economic way you should definetly try risks and have new ideas .however in other parts of life it is better to do what your experience is based on an what your good at .
