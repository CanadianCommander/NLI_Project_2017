how will our planet look like in twenty years ?this question is on all the conversations about the consequences of what we are doing today .will it look better or worse ?it s not the debate today but one of the interrogations concern the use of cars , which become more and more accurate all over the world .on the one hand , we can think that the number of cars will progress significantly in the years to come , thanks to economic progress and innovations in technology .more and more countries nowadays use cars : in china , for example , the car industry is in great development , and as there are really many inhabitants , we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive market in a few years .but in the other hand , we may add that considerations about environment protection are taking more and more importance , the sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents , more especially , of course , in developed countries , which had already known the excitment of car technology and had also already benefit from its advantages .so the point now is to find solutions to limitate the damages of cars on the environment , such as the recent alternatives that are developing in france today .in big cities , the public power is making big ad campaigns in order to attract people to use common transports [ bus , metro . .. ]or to use a bike .so in my view , it s obvious that we would never be able to make the number of cars decrease because of its general use ; it s really part of our lives and i think that we would nt be able to live without cars , it s now impossible , cars have too much incidences .as a result , there wo nt be fewer cars in use thant there are today . ..maybe it would be the case in france , and i hope so to preserve our environment ; but if we consider the whole world , cars have great days ahead of them .their sales prove it significantly . ..
