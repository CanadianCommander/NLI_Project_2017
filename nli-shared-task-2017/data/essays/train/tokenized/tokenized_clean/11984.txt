from my point fo view , answering that question requires a previous one - what does the word ` community  involve to you ? .as far as i am concerned , that word is not affected by a lot of factors , by a number of meanings . ..any person will probably tell you that those who develop their normal lifes around you are your community .being religion the main - or most common - reason for that union , most of the time .as i see it , to find the honest , deep , vivid meaning of ` community  you have to look much further .i would name as my ` community  those people who affect my life in different aspects , who have the power to change my path one way or the other .those people with whom i live and learn everyday .my community and me are able to play a larger and more important part in one another s lifes .i do not agree with the idea of young people not using their time to help their communities .actually i believe that most of them do it everyday , by taking an active part in their own lifes and in the ones of those who live with them .to exemplify my point i will add some cases considered by me as some relevant ways to help .a boy who spends his time explaning to a classmate a problem that will help him pass an important exam .a law student who has to work everyday as hard as possible and study , she does not have time for herself , however , she teachs her niece english for free each weekend to help her pass , because that girl knows her brother can not afford extra english classes .in a nutshell , if those who agree with that statement consider young people to be selfish , i think they are completely wrong .what is more , they should take a moment to look around and to ask young people what are they doing , i am sure that they will prove them all wrong .
