i believe that specializing in one subject is better and more important in the world we live in today , than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be very good socially since it allows the person to communicate with people on many subjects .however it is not enough in the society that we live in today , since you can not have a decent job if you merely have broad knowledge of things .jobs require specific and thorough knowledge of a specific subject or subjects .working as a lawyer for example requires thorough and indepth knowledge of the law and general knowledge would not be enough to become a lawyer .specializing in one subject means that that person is going to become really good at that subject and that therefore he may pursue it in the future .this ensures that this person will be able to find a job in our now very specialized world .someone who specializes in finance , for example , may work at a bank and then from there he can learn about many other things , which help in everyday life , and he can gain knowledge from having a job .therefore specialization leads to broader knowledge in other subjects .specialization , as it was discovered and agreed upon by most economists including the `` father of economics  , adam smith , leads to greater efficiency .this is because someone who specializes in something and does it all the time discovers ways to improve upon it and therefore becomes an expert in that field .this has led to an increase in the specialisation of the workplace and jobs .that is way anyone who wishes to succeed in life and have a job needs to specialize in something .due to all of this broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not better than specializing in one subject , atleast not at this point in time .
