understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts .i am agree with this statement .there are several reasons for this .one do not have to waste time for learning facts and also experience can help students to learn facts .just understanding the idea and concept can also help to be more creative .it is a waste of time to give students everything about the topic .they need to run their own brains to understand what the whole lecture is about .for example in an art class , theacher wants from students to create a new tool for kitchen .he gives the idea about what he wants but if he gives the facts they do not have to search anything to increase their knowledge and ability as well .they can not look from a different perspective .experience is one of the most important point to learn something .for instance , you studied your lesson and you had your driving licence .without having experince how you expect to drive as good as the others can .experience is more important than learning facts .you give the idea and concept .afterwards they experince it in the real life by facing them .being flexible in our creations depends on how free we are .just having the idae can help being more creative .in order to think well , sometimes we should learn facts by searching about them .in conclusion , try to learn facts is a kind of waste of time and without experiencing the concepts we learn do not help us to improve ourselfs .according to these reasons i am disagree with this statement .
