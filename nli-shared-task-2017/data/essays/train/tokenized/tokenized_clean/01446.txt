`` you should go to school , learn a lot of different things . ..that is what parents often said .but i not completly agree the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in deed , i support the way that specialization is a good thing .so , people know what they are talking about .in some fields , like men who built houses , specialization is necessary : how could be someone as good the painting as wood table ?furthermore , it implies a more longer study if you want to have a broad knowledge .moreover , if someone has a broad knowlede , i think it is impossible that he knows accurently all his many academic subjects he had even learned .this is a great problem , there is not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity .you need to be very smart , like leonard from vinci .he is a good exemple . ..nevertheless , in contrary to my first explaination , it is important too , to have people who know a little bit of all .important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referant between specialists .and because of their knowledge , they will be able to resolve problem and manage a team .that s why they confere a great adaptibility .to conclude with this statement , i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists .the both are complate themselves .but like specialized doctors in esthetic for example , could nt ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and after that more specialized in one subject ?
