according to the reading passage successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i think that successful people should try new things beside doing what they already know how to do well .because , when you try new things , you get to know some different things in your life , and it will give you a whole lot of new experience and you can have knowledge of different kinds of new ideas and techniques which , you can , implement in your actual business .as you are already a sucessful person , you do not have to bother about loss or any kind of disturbance in your business when you try some thing new .and when you try some thing new you can effectively apply your previous ideas and experiences into it which you have gained from your routine business .as you are a successful person you have more contacts and relations in the commercial market which you can use when you start a new business , as it gives you great chances of having a good start in the market .but if you are not successful , and you are new in the business feild then you have to deal with different problems like , you should have knowledge about few important business aspects like production , management , investment , marketing , and many other things which creates a lot of problems in future if they are not maintained properly .but if you are successful then you can use your previous experiences and intelligence .but , if you want to try something new beside your previous business , then first you should consider in which feild you want to invest or which business you want to start .before starting a new business you should thing about what you are investing in , whether it is proper to invest in a particular business rather , because it reduces the amount of risk you take whille trying something new .
