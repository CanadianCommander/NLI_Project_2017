it is important for the students to learn ideas and concepts than the facts .student should understand about ideas and concepts in order to develope a way of thinking .if you try to learn the facts alone you would probably miss the main point .for example , if you are a student and study on an invation of constantinopolis you should study on ideas and concept in that era .if you try to learn about the details and facts about the invation you will probably dont understand the events and the ideas of invation .idea is to have an important city not to kill the people .another example is qeographical topics .if you just memorize some important information about a country without understanding peoples customs in that country .you will probably forget what you memorize before .if you just memorize how many square china is you will miss the most importnat parts like how china became an important counrty economicly .even in health class , it is important to learn what is the reqirements an healty place for elder people .you should evaluate all the requrements with someone elder who you closely know .you shold maybe discuss about one topic with her to understand he feelings about the topic .if you just list the requirements you would probably forget soon .i beleive that if you understand something deeply you should understand the idea and the message first .students should avoid to memorize the facts to have knowlage about what they are studing .otherwise they would just read the text books and understand nothing usefull for their lifes in future .
