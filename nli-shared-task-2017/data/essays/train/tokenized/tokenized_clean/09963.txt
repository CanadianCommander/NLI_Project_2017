i disagree with this statement because in my opinion for the new work s world is more important be specialized in one specific subject than in many academic subjects .i think that because in my school i have studied a lot of subjects but i admit saying many things but these subjects are nt studied in a specific way .in fact i have found a lot of problems when i came in my university , where is important only one specific subject .the new world of the work , in my opinion , requests a specific kind of worker .in fact now there are many type of works and the number of people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are not increasing .i try to use an example .an architect that creates all of the parts of his project is rare .we can find a lot of architects or designers that are specialized only in one specific subject .it is so because is changed the university and the new work s world searches different kind of workers .so , i think that is important study one specific subject and do the best work that i could make .
