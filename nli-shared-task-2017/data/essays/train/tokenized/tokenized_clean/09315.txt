there are some fluctuations in usage of some items while the time pass and the technolgy improves .some people thinks in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , but i do not think so .there are some items which their usage is decrasing day by day because of the improving technology .they replaced by their improved ones , like walkmans .in the past , we listen music by walkmans very often but nowadays we prefer mp3 players that are more easy to use and have high music storage capacity .like walkman , cars are improving every day but they are not replaced by another trasport vechile .people still need cars for trasportation , but ofcourse with newer modals are preferd .in turkey in 1970s , every family has maximum only one car .because there are very small production of cars in turkey and it is very expensive to buy a car .in general people has not enough power to purchuase a car .moreover having a car is not very nesscesry for every one because cities were not as big as today .throughout the passing years , our country becomes to have better financial power and production quantity of cars increase while their prices are decreasing .so now nearly all famillies has a car and some of them has more than one .the reason for having hgher amount of car is not only the low prive , in todays world every individual needs to own a car for fast and easy trasportation .we are in the technology age in which time is money .in conclusion , ofcourse there are some items which loose their importance and thir usage decreases when the time pass .i think not only cars will keep their importance , but also their uasge will increase in twenty years .
