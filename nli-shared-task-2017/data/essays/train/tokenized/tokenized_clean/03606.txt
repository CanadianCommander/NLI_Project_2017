broad knowledge is very important in academic life .a person who wants to have an academic career should be aware of a lot of academic issues .however specialization makes people more successful and unconfused .so i do disagree the statement .first of all , it is obvious that people who have academic careers , should have a broad knowledge of not only academic subjects but also the global issues around them .however specialization is needful for academic periphery .let us imagine a professor ; when a student ask some general questions about his or her research project , he can answer them but if the student asks some specific questions , the professor can not be satissfying in details .brain has a capacity of knowledge .if a human behaviour focus on a lot of issues , he or she can be aware of much more things but can not know anything in details .secondly , when we look at developing countries , we see that specialization is the main point in this development process .people do what they know best .without argument it is clear that entellectual knowledge is important in social life and benefits people to have a vision of life .however , in the academic career specilization make the people successfull .people have a peception capacity .therefore people should choose the subjects which are in their perception of academic career .in the conclusion , all of those reasons show that , person who want to succeed in his or her academic career , should specialize in some subjests .the academician can be confused on the other option .people should do best in their working life .making best happens only if specialization happens .broad knowledge brings broad intellegence , it can be denied .however focusing on his or her work makes academic person more clear about his or her knowledge .
