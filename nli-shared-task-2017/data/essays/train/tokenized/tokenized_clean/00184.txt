successful people use to take risk in the projects that they are involved in .in my own opinion , these people are success because they innovate , they are not scare of the risk and they are confident in their posibilities .i believe that these three personal features are requiered to be a talent and succesful person nowadays .firstly , innovating is necessary to achieve better results .if you prove always the same thing in the same manner you will obtain the same result .innovation could give you a new way of doing thinks .for that reason , i support that those people who innovate could be closer to successed than those who do not .secondly , to be a risky person means not be scare about the future .from my point of view those who are not afraid about the future bad consequences of their actions have more time to concentrate in their actions .therefore , think more in how to progress and inprove their day to day life than in regreating about what they did in the past .third , be confident is a very important personal characteristic .because , those who have a winner opinion their believe in their possibilities .in addition , this kind of people dares to perform whatever they have planned .so , they do in an optimistic way .to sum up , successful people have the combination of these three personal qualities .the strong point of their achievements is do not do the things that already know that works .these people innovates , risk and prove themselves that they can do it better .
