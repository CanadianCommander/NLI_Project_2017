i agree with the point that `` better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than going for a specialization in one specific subject  .i support this point because we can learn many applications by having many subjects in academic .the main reason is by learning more subjects we can interpret them and can apply the knowledge one through another .for example if we have to work on a project like developing a machine .we have to about the strength it will withstand , to know this we have to work for stresses that apply on the parts of the machine .but it is difficult to find manually , because first designing the machine the load that with stand on the machine , etc .now days that we have simulation softwares that can work by producing a model in that .for this we need a computer knowledge and how to work on the software .and then how to design the model , loads , etc .for all these we need different subjects like , for working with computer we have to computer knowledge , for working to design we need to know the drawing , for finding the loads we have to the mechanis of material , then to solve we need mathematics , and then for assembling we have to learn how to assemble the part .by seeming all these for one thing we have to work on for different subjects .we need to apply all the skills in on project .after learning basics in all subjects then we can go for a specialized one because we work for a perticular model .so i prefer to have knowledge of many academic subjects in order to have a specislized subject , because if we know all the subjects we need not go for some other specialists we can apply all those .
