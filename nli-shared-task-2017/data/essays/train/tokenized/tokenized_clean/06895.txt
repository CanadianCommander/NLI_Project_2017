i partially agree to the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .this is very much true and applicable to the present day situation as knowledge of only one subject is going to reduce the number of options a person has in his career .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help a person view a particular situation or issue in different angles and can be more careful in taking a decision after taking into consideration all the ins and outs of that situation or issue .for example , if we consider a marketing executive trying to sell a washing machine , he should have knowledge though not in detail on the different small electrical systems that make up the total machine , also he needs to have knowledge on different kinds of textile fabrics and how the washing machine should be used in case of each fabric .he can be successful only if he convinces the customer and to convince he needs to have broad based knowledge on all the those discussed .people with broad based knowledge can easily shift careers according to what the industry demands and have a great flexibility to work in any area of specialization .on the contrary , the world would not have developed so much if there were no people with specialization in one subject .only if one understands each and every concepts , can he implement them and bring out a new product .there would not have been new discoveries if there are no specialists in this world .referring to the washing machine example , only a specialist and not generalist can build such a machine and can improve the features of it .specialists are very important when it comes to the technology development and advancement .concluding this , having specialization is also important but what i feel is there should be a good mixture of complementing each other .
