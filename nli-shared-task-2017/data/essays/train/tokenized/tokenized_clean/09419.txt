i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well .there are two reasons .first , when high school student , i attended boxing club .in practicing , i prefered to weaker people to fight with , because it easy way to improve my technic without pain .in other words , i was ordinary boxer and could not win at big competitons .on the other hand , one of our club member tried to fight with stronger person than he is everytime .i think he tried new things which is risky to become strong boxer .finally , he won a big competiton and be chosen as a japan s representate boxer .second , the president of microsoft corporation dropped off his school and focused on a new technology .although it is challenge , if he failed , he loses good oppotunity for prestige since his university is well known for reserch and study .he invented new programs and it spread out all over the wolrd nowadays and is the world richest person of this year .in conclusion , at least these two successful persons challenged new styles and found their styles .it derives from taking risk somehow , so i regard that people who achieve something have tendency of challenging new things and taking risks .
