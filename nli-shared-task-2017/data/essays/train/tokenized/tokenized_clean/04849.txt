people have their own ideas about whether they concentrate on the broad sujects or not .some people may say that we have to study special subject for developing speciality .in my opinion , however , it seems clear that learning many subjects is more important than the sepcific subject because of selection and relation of job .first , when it comes to the selection of job , knowing a lot of fields enables people to have many options which they select jobs .it is generally agreed that if we study more subject , we would gain more items of considering occupations .for example , in my case , i majored in environment and i am soldier , in other words , i studied environment as major and explained army skill .therefore , i can select my future whether i would be a soldier or environmentalist .moreover , if people have so many selection , they would fail to live in their life .therefore , the so many selection have positive effect on studentrs .second , as far as relation of jobs is concerned , some jobs are relative to other jobs , people have the common sense that math is similiar to physics , science , engineering and so on .therefore , all subects are relative to any other subjects and we can say that the some occupations also similiar to other jobs .for instance , if people want to be a computer specialist , they should understand engineerinig workers and investors and also know math , science , engoneer and so on .in other words , computer science involve in engineering , math , science and other fields .furthermore , in the companies , persons who work at same corporation have each major and they have influence on each other .therefore , they must know respective fields for developing their company .in this way we can say that we must understand many fields .to sum up , i agree with the statements in that we had better gain more knowledges from learning lot of subjects .if we study many academic subjects , we can obtain so many benefits , all things considered , i can definitely say that we must study many subjects .
