there are two different ways for learning , one is understanding , and the other is learning facts .considering something in different aspects , learning to give own opinions , and thinking deeply for more realization are the reasons for me to agree that it s more important for students to realize ideas than just learn the fact .considering something in different aspects is a very good advantage in understand ideas because students can think the topic much broader .thus , they might try to see something in another way , and get some more reward by thinking in this way .as an example , when students face some questions , they might discuss it in many ways .next , learning to give own opinions is another supporting point .because students understand the concepts , they would give their view point to it , in stead of following the facts .for instance , after reading the text books , if teacher asked them to tell something behind the content , students would try to think the content again and give their own opinions .according to considering something in different aspects and learning to give own opinions , thinking deeply for more realization is the most important reason for supporting that understanding ideas and concepts is better than learning facts for students .when students think deeply , they might find out more interesting things or discover something they dos nt know before .for example , teacher would use this way to lead students to read literatures , study science , and reaserch biology .considering in different ways , learing to give personal points , and thinking deeply are three reasons for me to argue that understanding is more important .
