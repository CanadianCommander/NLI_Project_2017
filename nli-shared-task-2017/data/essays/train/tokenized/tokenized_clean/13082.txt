travelling is one of the most popular pastimes .most people are usually plan to travel across the country or overseas in their own life .they enjoy talking about diverse experiences where each person traveled .from my experience , i agrees with the travel in a group led by a tour guide with some economical and exciting reasons .firstly , i like to travel in group led by a tour guide bacause i can save more money and time .a tour guide is professional enough to give us more infomation fitted to places what we want to travel .in addition , a tour guide needs to compete other agencies , and it try to give more benefits for its clients .a tour guide also has a lot of experienced information about what i want to travel , so it is kind to consult to give information .the more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with a several of people for themselves .we can have chance to socialieze a lot of new people .if we travel around unfamiliar places alone , it is difficult to first talk about unfamiliar people .so it can be alone .however , traveling in group first it is easy to talke about each other .to sum up , i recommend the travel in a group led by a tour guide in terms of economial and pleasing points .
