one thing i have learned from both experience in reality and in academic training is that truth should be stated with qualifications , so i would say that this statement is not a hundred percent true .successful people in my definition , at least do one thing better than others .and as the limitation of human life and energy in contrast with the immense diverse activities that might be of interest to you , i feel that successful people are more specialists than generalists .i would appreciate people with the courage and enthusiaism to try new things and take risks as this would probably lead to discovery of new knowledge of world and of oneself .the first kind of fruits is most evident with various kinds of inventions and innovations .edison is an old but always appopriate example .the man is full of creativity and spent his life exploiting this talent , leaving us hundreds of inventions and shine up our lives literally .the second part of the meaning of trying new things is more subtle .this is actually in accordance with the delphic words : `` know thyself  .i personally believe not many of us know what materials we are at an early stage of life .much of our time and energy is spent in a trial and error pprocess which may last to different stages of our life depending on the difference of perseverance and energy and luck .we try new things to see a new us and the experience is our treasure that we carry on .some people are quite lucky to know what they want at a relatively early age but this does not mean they are unsuccessful , on contrast , their chance of success may be higher as they have more time to develop that aspect as we agree that it is not easy to really do something better than others .mozart and bethoven who i bet did not do major things outside music and they do it from childhood .they demonstrate their expertise from very young and this is the only passion of their life .this is quite the same situation with other genius .they know how to write well , paint well or compose well and they do it all the time .they may try other things as a diversion , but i guess what we label them successful rests on this main talent .so different people can succeed in different ways .i would not think it very wise to identify characteristics and qualities that a successful person must possess .a spirit of discovery and exploration would be helpful .as we generally do not know what we will do well , it is natrual that we have higher chances to discover it by trying new things and taking risks .a higher probablity is stated on this assumption .
