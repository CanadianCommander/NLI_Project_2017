i believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older people do .young ones have nothing to worry about and they always remain close to their parents , pals and obviously cartoons which keep them happier .the older people have much more things to make their life enjoyable but the kind of enjoyment young one takes , its just cant be comparedfirstly , they dont have any sort of tension in their life as the older ones have .it s a very wise saying that , `` life is too short buddy , dont spend the time of your life in worries  .older ones have responsibility towards their family , their job , their society which makes their life somewhat miserable and full of worries as compared to the young ones .many philosophers also have supported the view that children are the most innocent species on the earth .so , obviously being innocent and without worry may be sounds impractical to an older man but in reality this is the main reason behind being happythe family and friends of a child act as an agent of socialisation teaching them the difference between the good and the bad .these agents of socialisation always put them in such a domain where the child will always prosper .they bring every thing for the child that is necessary for his goodwill and for leading toward a bright future .friends are also play a big role in developing a childrens life which makes their life enjoyablethirdly , they can do the things in their future what the older people do , for instance , going to a club or mountain trekking or having a girlfriend .but the older people cant have the type of fun the young ones have as they cant switch back to their past .we heard many times older people saying , `` wish i would be young again  and many songs too by famous artists .thus , family , friends and all of the agents of socialisation having around the children to keep take care of them , children dont have the thing called worries .and if they have , then santacluase always present around them to make them happy
