the way of successthe answer to this question depends on your own experiences and the succesful people that you know .for me , if a person wants to become more successful , he or she obviously take some risks and try new things .risks are the way of the succes .firstly , by taking risks , you can make your position higher or earn much more money .people can learn new lessons and ways , gain a lot of experiences by only taking risks , making mistakes and trying new things .for example , my father who is a really successful manager in a big company had a lower position , an engineer who earns really less money for working a lot , when he first started to work .then , he made a big decision for changing his destiny .he and my family moved to a foreign city without any information and experiences .i did not know this place and also i had never heard anything about it like my family .it was a big change for me and my father .however , this important risk affected my fathers carreer in a successful way .if he did not decide to do it , maybe he would not become a manager as he is now .it is really important to make right directions in situations .secondly , nobody can become better if he does not take risk and try new things .this is a strict rule of life .succesful commanders , generals , presidents always take some risks and try nwe things .for illustrating it , ataturk , the saviour of my country , is an extraordinary example .he took some critical risks to be success in first world war .our army was weaker and smaller than our enemies .however , ataturk and the army attacked some really important times .it was a huge risk but by taking those risks , my country is a free one .in conclusion , we should take some risks and try new ways in some moments of our life because human life span is relatively short .it is the way of success .
