i do nt think that young people must be enjoy life more than older people do .becasue the point of view for a enjoyed life was different in the different people s opinion .the young people thought that they enjoy life more than older people do because they find out that the place where they  enjoy their life  or  have fun  such like the disco bar , video game room , cinema etc. they seldom get the older people s body , and they have spend more money on the food , drinking , chothes than the older people .so that s why the young man think the older man did not know how to `` enjoy their lifes  .but it is not the truth .the older people have their own method to enjoy their own lifes .such as fishing , playing chess , all sorts of not so exciting and more fitable action for the older ones .and not only the envoriment is the whole of enjoy life , to finished a new job , to raise their boys and girls , these all imply the enjoy life of the older people .
