i completely agree with the statement .we are in the consumis time , that means that people buy things and industrial products not when they really need them , but only for the pleasure to buy something new and have the pleasant sensation to spend the money in those modern supermarket , which you can find everything new in .in this way a person always feels to be original and `` modern  , not `` ancient  like people that surroand him or her .with this new conception of the money and about the way to spend them , the productors of objects that are every day used ( such the mobile phone , the tv , the shoes and so on ) invent always new way to make those products attractive .in this way people feel obliged to buy the last thecnological mobile phone for example , otherwise the seem to be out , but not for the really need to have it .and what is the best way to let their new products be known all over the world ?the answer for this question is simple and everyone know the answer .simply the answer is : advertisement .we can watch the tv or only look at every journal to verify this sad truth .if the advertisement is the quicker and most seen way to spread news about an industrial product , in order to let people know my last innovations , why do nt use this simple way of diffusion according to the imprenditor s volonty ?and in order to sell more pieces of a product , so that this imprenditor can get much more money , what about making an advertisement annunce putting lies in ?it s not a true lie , but only a manner to pubbicize the product in a wrong way : not like an object that you can buy only if you really need it , but like an object that you ca nt live without it .for this reasons advertisements make product better they really are .
