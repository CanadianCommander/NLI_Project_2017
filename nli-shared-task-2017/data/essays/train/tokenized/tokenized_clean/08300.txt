this is a difficult topis as both travelling in a group and travelling alone has its advantages and disadvantages .and the choice also can vary from person to person .in my case i dont agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are various reasons to support my choice and these are discussed below .firstly in the case of taking tour in a group led by guides , there is time boundness .the tour guides manages the time keeping in mind the whole group .in this case i can not spend much time on the places which i really like .if i am trevelling on my own i can visit the places of my choice .secondly , in the group travel the tour guides generally make the staying arrangements at the places which have better facility .in this case you do not get a chance to interact with the local people .when i am taking a tour i like to know the local cultures and talk to the local people. , because i think that is more fun .additionally i like to try the local food if i am going to some new place .this gives me a chance to improve my knowledge about that place and the people there .in a guide led tour there are very less chances of doing that .furthermore , i am a spontaneous person by nature .i enjot thing at certain moment .so if i am taking a tour with several other people it will not be possible to do watever i want .and in this case i will not be able to enjoy properly and it will not be fun for me .so in the conclusion i want to say that it actually depends upon the individual whether he likes to travel in a group led by tour guide or on his own .
