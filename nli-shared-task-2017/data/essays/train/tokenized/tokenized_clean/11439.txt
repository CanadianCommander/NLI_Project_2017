i personally think that young people give a lot of time helping their communities , but we must specify the age of these young people because when i think about young people i include people from 18 to 30 years old .lets think about all the volounters in their contry or in africa , i really think that s huge .in fact , if we see more closer all the association or organosation we would find a lot of young people helping the next , trying to give to the people who have very little the help they need .as well all the soldiers that go and beat to defend their contry are really honorable .i think that you really must have something in you that push you hardly to do those things because it is really difficult .we should be very altruist to go and fight with people who needs support .i d say that one of the beautiest quality for a person is the altruism , it is something really good for a men to have and use it .moreover , we can think about all the great fight led by thew young people during the history and now , for examples the pacific fight of martin luther king or all the parade made by young people to stop the war in world .eventhough not only young people helps the todays societyfinally , even if a lot of young people are not helpful as other we should respect everyone for his business , because not everybody has the same quality .
