the answer of this statement depends on personal life exxperience and different culture background .some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude .howere , in my part , i prefer to make my trip alone than in a group as my inclination .among countless reasons , there are two conpicuous aspects as follows .the main reason why i disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange .if you join a group you can only go to the places which the tour guid lead s you to and hve no free time to communicate with the local people .in contrast , travelling alone you get the access to the local people  s life and culture .trought talinking and living with them , you hcan shre different culture and perspectives on life .that will only present you a new culture or tradition of life , also cast a new light on your old viewpoints on the culture and world .there is another reason deserves some words here .travelling in a group led by tutor is a waste of money in some conditions .becuase the guide depends on the money you spent on the trip to survive .they usually convice the traveller things that have no value become the necessarities and buy them .in contrast , if trvalling along a person can use computer to get the information about the unkown place .through internet a traveller can find things they rreally need , such as local tasty food , the ticket for museums and other basic necessiries .they save money and spend for the trip .of coures , travelling in a group also have a couple of advantagges .in some areas , travelling with a tour guid is much safer than alone .and safe is the foudation of every trip .but the disadvantages carry more with than advantages .based on the aboe reasons , i can easily come the conclusion that i disagree with make the trip in a group led by tour guid .
