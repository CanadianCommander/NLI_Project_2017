it is said that if we make success in our lives , we should try new things which we are unfamiliar and let put ourselves into new situation .this is like some catch phrases of some advertisements .i do not 100 % agree with this theory because people who can make success are only people who have found their devotions or niches .the reason why i stated i did not 100 % agree with giving statement on left page was that i could agree with the point of trying new things in order to make success .i think trying new things is very good for us because we fully utlize our experiences and knowledges , which reflect how we enthusiastically have lived in each of our lives , and concentrate to solve problems in each moment .such experience definitely guide us to grow up and become more mature than before ; thus , it will increase the percentage of our success due to our own personal development .however , if we refer only making success like giving statement above , it si different soty .we are able to make success without making anything new .whether or not we can male success depends on whether or not we can be passionate with what we are doing .although what we do is sort of repetetive things , eventually we can meet success as long as we enjoy them and keep being motivated .biologically , human brains are supposed to work well when we enjoy what we do and want to devote them .when we look back to history , it proves that people who keep their effort toward one thing and dedicate themselves into it have bacome famous historical person , such like scholers or artists , etc .we can always go to next chapter when we hope to do it .it is not necessary to try new things and take resks for it .the important thing is that figuring out our own devotions , niches .if we feel what we do is not we can be passionate , then we should urge ourselves to try new things .we should always believes our brain s fuctions which lead us to sucess as long as we are passionate , enjoying what we do , and alway have vision to make success .
