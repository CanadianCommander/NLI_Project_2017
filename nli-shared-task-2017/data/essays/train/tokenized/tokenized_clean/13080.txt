i agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .to my mind , this is a typical but natural problem of advertisment .showing an obvious benefit of buying the product , or even present a brand to a new market , advertisment is designed to let the selling rates increase .and that is why advertisment only announces the advantages of a product , but not the disadvantages or problems that may occur if using it .moreover , the designer of the advertisment is not necessarily interested in the benign of the user who buys the product , despite , he or she just wants to sell it .to show this problem , i will make two examples of advertisement : everybody knows that chocolate tastes sweet and delicious on the one hand , but if you eat to much of it , you will get fat .nevertheless , the advertisement only deals with the delicious taste or may show a famous person - who is of course not fat at all - eating the chocolate product which shall be bought .another , very obvious example for an advertisement exaggerating the use of the product is the advertisement for washing powder : if you use one special brand of washing powder , your clothes will get cleaned much better than bz using another product .and the white t-shirts in the advertisement are as white one can hardly imagine .but despite of the negative effects of advertisement , there are positive one s , too .without advertisement you get no idea of the variety of products you are able to buy .and as you know the problems of advertisement , you can judge it better .i think every adult , and also most of the teenagers know that not everything advertisement provides is true .nevertheless the product may have an advantage .and often you realize new products which you maybe searching for only by the advertisement .in conclusion , although most advertisement present products better than they really are , it is not so bad many people belief .and moreover : you do not have to buy these products .
