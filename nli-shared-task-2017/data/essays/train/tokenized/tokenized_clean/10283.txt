i m a person who like to experience new things , i change lots of sports , i play lots of instruments .so i think is nice to try new things .above all when you do something very well maybe you can annoy doing this more , so it appears ecxiting to do something new and why not a risk .it s also important to know very well how to do a precise thing , above all if it s your work , what i have say until now is referred to hobbies and not to work .i believe that if you have a secure work it s better continue to do that even if it bacame boring in the time .i think is good and beautiful to try new expierences and to take sometimes any risks because it make our life more interesting and more exiting , it s boring to do only the same things all the days for all our life , it is nt good , we have to try new sensation and we have to feel new emotions to permit ouselfs to grown up .personally , i think that our life is only one , you can live only once , so you have to live all the things the nature gives you in respect of the life someone gives you .you can failed , you can not like what you are trying , but the important is that you have tried it , you can say `` i did it  . if you died happy , without thinking to a thing you would like to do and you did nt creat the oppurtuniy to really do this , you may spent the most beautiful life that you can hope for yourself .to do something new in my advice is really great , it always gives you an emotions that you ca nt receive from other occasions .you can always do the same things and do them very well or try new sensations and stay well with yourself , personally , i choose the second one opportunity .
