i would like to dicuss on the question if young people nowadays do nt help enough in their communities .by thinking about this notion the question arises what is the communitie for the teenagers today .is it their household , their family , is it the life at school or their position in the society ?all these settings changed like everything changed in the world .in the consequence of new aspects in their life and new influences which affect on them , a new realtion to all of the cummunities , which could exist for a teenager , is build .so you can not compare the attitudes of helping in a community from nowadays with the situation 20 or more years ago .you could juxtapose the societies and communties in realtion to the helping of teenagers at this time .before around 40 years all people neede the community to stay alive .this dependence is one of the mainfacts why the attitude of teenagers with helping in nower time is another one than 40 years ago .i agree with the position that they do not help as much as around 40 years ago but i m opposed with the statement that they do nt help enough .everybody will feel if they need to help more than now , but just now our the society is fed up with people who wants to work and can not work because of the less jobs .anther point is the communitiy at home - the family .it could be that there re a lot of children and teenagers how do nt care about their family and the staff in it .i would not mention that the parents have the foult at this situation , the social sorrounding of their children influence them more than any other asepect .i m convinced that something have to change in this .but for reasons already stated i would suggest that the development of the society is the reason for that .the teenagers do nt need their parents anymore , or they think .because the reality shows that those children who run away from their home , or those who does nt care on their family they will not be succesfull in their future .they think they can use their time much better that spending time with their parents .all things considered i would state that there is no problem with the realtion between the society , the state and the young teenagers because at this time they are not used to work or give their power to the general society , but in realtion to their family i totally agree with the given statement .i is justified to say that there have to change anything to cope with the now situation .they have to realise that they need their pa
