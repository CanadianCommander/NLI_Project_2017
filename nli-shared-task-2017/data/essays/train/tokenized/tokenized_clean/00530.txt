different people have different answers to this statement .it depends on the person s personality , perferences and characters .those people who have more working experiences will think that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i hold this view point too .first of all , companies hair many movie stars , famous singers , as well as those politicans to sing high praise for the products .consumers will think the products will as good as those stars , because they wo nt hire those unfimilar people to the mass .but actually , will those products  quality is as good as those stars ?i think most of the time the answer is no .we should judge the products quality by experient or by our experience .second , most advertisements use a lot of fancy method to attract consumers .they use television , radio , magazines , newspapers and internet to attract them .these kind of mass media can give the reader more colorful and lively demonstrations .it exceed the original products and give the consumer the fake idea .third , most advertisments express their ideas with too much good words .we all have the experience that we were introduced a kind of products by the advertisments that their products is the best in all of the same products , their products can be uses more than 100 years , the car they sold is the cheapest .but what is the truth , maybe it is a very bad product .
