the way to travel that someone can choose is highly related with her/his personnality .there is basically two way to travel : the first one would be to travel in a group leading by a guide and the itinerary is known before the departure , and decided in an certain amount of time .the second way would be to travel on our own , and the itinerary will be mostly directed by the people we meet and places we outlined before the departure .in this essay , i will discuss in the first paragraph the advantages that a travel in a group has , and in the second paragraph , the disadvantages that it implies .when travelling in a group , we are more lucky to meet people who share the same way to think .it can be a way for people who have issues in communication to meet people and open themselves .it s also probably for people who does nt want to travel alone , and enjoy having time with people they do nt know .on the point of view of the travel itself , travelling with a guide has the advantages to learn things about the country visited that would be propbably harder to know if travelling alone .tour guide travels are also made to see the most of things and landscapes , to experience local traditions in a few amount of time .however , this kind of travel gives not place for the adventure and for unexpected experiences .by travelling by ourself , we have the right of decision on where we want to go and when .we can decide to stay longer in a place that we enjoy .it s also more probable to meet local people and directly experience the culture , in contrary to the travel tour , in which culture are translated and explained by the tour guide , in our own language .the fact to be in direct relation with the local used language is , for my part , of importance in travels .to conclude , for my part , i disagree on the fact that travel in a tour travel is the best way to travel .however , i do nt think there is a best way to travel in general , but everybody has its own best way to travel .for me , the adventure and liberty in decision are important to travel .
