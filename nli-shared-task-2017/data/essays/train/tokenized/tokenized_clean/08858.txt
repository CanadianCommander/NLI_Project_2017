`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i disagree to this statement because of the following reasons .first , there is a problem in defining the term `` enough time  .it remains unclear how much time any given person should spend helping the community .furthermore , who decides what is helpful to the community ?which things that have to be done in a community should be done by volunteers and which should be done by professionals ?these questions arise when accusing young people of not spending enough time helping their communities .apart from these terminological problems , there are so many young people doing voluntary work for the community .i experience that they spend their time working for the red cross , helping at home looking after elder family members , getting involved with the scouts or at church .these are just examples of the many places in a community where you easily find young people helping the society .the impression that young people nowadays do not help the community can arise , because today , a lot is expected of the young : during the morning , they are at school .in the afternoon and at night they are busy doing their homework , having a job to earn extra money or they have hobbies ( e.g. sports or music ) .due to globalization , competition between young people has become more .they have to work harder in order to be prepared for their future .nowadays , in a lot of professions , one does not only have to compete with people from one s own country , but with people world-wide .modern means of communication and transportation have made the world a very fast-paced and competetive place .in order to be able to compete , young people nowadays have to be succsessful in a lot of areas : school ( to acquire knowledge ) , hobbies ( to show diverse interest ) , jobs ( to earn extra money ) , and community work ( to help the community where they live ) .as shown in this text , i disagree with the hypothesis given .first , there are problems with the definition and quantification of `` help  and `` engough time  .second , there are so many young people who work for the community .third , young people have to prepare their own personal future .did young people in former times spend more time to helping their communities ?
