not all that glitters is gold .a very general statement yet very true .a statement that should be hung in every company s marketing and advertising departments , because i think that most of the dvertisments polish up their products .evidence to that are the policies that some companies in the united states have concerning the `` refundable , no question asked  policy .for example , the famous department store found all across the u.s called target operates under this policy , giving its customers a three month time span for returning and getting a refund for a purchased product .had the product been fairly advertised consumers would be returning less products as they would only purchase a product that they are sure of .i once watched a five minute advertisment on one of the advertising channels concering a certain product for the complexion .in the commercial they showed several before and after pictures of people who claimed to have used this product .it was very clear to me , as it would have been to any computer user , that so much of the picres shown of the after had been altered on the computer .with the new advancemnets of technology and high developments in the computer manufacture industries something like that can be easily done .the product was over estimated in price and quality .i can say that with confidence , for my friend fell for the smell of fake roses and bought the product , the next day she satyed home because she had a horrible rash all over her face .so it is not surprising that i strongly agree the fact that most advertisments are over done and do not reflect the true value of the product .as i said earlier , the advertising and marketing departments should be more truthful .
