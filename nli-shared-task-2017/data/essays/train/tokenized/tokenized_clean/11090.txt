i always try new things in my life and i risk , because i do nt know if i will do these things very well .in fact i have nt always success in the new things that i try to do .but i agree with the statement that says that successful people try new things and risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i have some reason to sustain this statement .first of all , i think that if you do nt try or do nt risk , you ll never know if you will be good to do a thing or if you will be happy to tryied this thing .for example , last month a friend asked me `` why do nt you try to sing in my music band ?.i though that maybe i had not the ability and the experience of sing and become as a leader in a music band , but he said me `` in my opinion , you must try or you ll never know !.so i trusted him and i decided to try .now i m very glad of this decision because i love sing and also if maybe i m not a very good singer i enjoy myself !this is absolutely important .another example i can bring is about my sister .she s very insicure and she has nt much self-confidence .she likes reading poems , but she did nt want to try to write one !so my mother said her that she would be a good poet if only she wanted to try .now the poems of my sister are the best i ever heard .in conclusion i think that try to do a new thing is never a bad idea .in fact if also you will not have success you maybe will be happy !
