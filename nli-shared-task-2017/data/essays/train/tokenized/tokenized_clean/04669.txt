in twenty years a lot of things can happen , we can use cars more or fewer than nowadays .but if a have to choose i will say that in twenty years we will use less cars than today .i would support this answer by saying that in some years we will see some consequences of our irresponsable actions towards the enviroment so this could be usefull as a warning that will help people to be more consciense and careful with their actions .for example today we are confronting some of this consequences .such as pollution of the air , water , soil , etc , .we are getting many disease , cancer , intoxication also we are finishing with a lot of species and every species has a porpuse or a roll in the circle of life so we are desorganizing it .a good example is the problem with deforestation that we have , trees are leathel because they gives as oxigen and many different things and with out them the circle of oxigen will miss a basic component .in addition in twenty years technology will be more advanced so it would be more responsable .there will be more facilities for public transport .public transport is a good solution because we save time by moving a lot of people at the same time , we save money an gas that both are really important and also is less pollution because are fewer cars .lets put mexico city as an example , it has 22 million people as population and most of the have cars and a lot have more than one per family , imagine the traffic that they generate this will be follow by a huge waste of time and gas , so in conlusion by using public transport we will save all this problems .
