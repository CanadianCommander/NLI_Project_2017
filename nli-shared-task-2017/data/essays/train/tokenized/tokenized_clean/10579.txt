in my opinion , i admit that some people like to have broad knowledge than specialized one , but i rather like to have specialized knowledge of one specific subject .the primary reason of this is that people should have good or bad at academic subjects .i think it is waste of time to study dislike subject which they know they will never ever use after the examination or graduation .in my case , i had to study mathmatics and science when i was a first year at my highschool , but i hate them and the grade were very bad .because of this , at the tutorial , my tutor recommended me to quit them and concentrate on other subjects , so i did and the decision was very good for me .i could use all my time for studying essential subjects for my future and i have never regret of my decision ever .on the contrary , i have to admit that there are some good points for lerning , any academic subjects .the biggest one is that we can think of something from various direction .things sometimes related each other and lies on to various subjects , so broad knowledge could be very useful in some cases .however , i still believe that there are more good points in only one specialized deep knowledge than several shallow knowledge .the next reason for this is that most of the people shoud choose one specific subject sooner or later , so i think it is sooner the better to concentrate on the subject which they really like .in addition , i think it is much easier to remember or learn the things which people are interested in than reluctant to .from the reasons above , i believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
