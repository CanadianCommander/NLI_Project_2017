women and cars are the two mayor topics a man is concerned about .this will not change until there is no more man .when i take a look at my friends , everybody owns a car .you turn to 16 .what s your wish .you want to have an own car .during the last 50 years a car has became the number one status symbol .having a car is also a symbol of freedom .driving through an avenue on a sunny day makes you feel good and confident .i have to admit that our thoughts about the environment became less and less .what about the air pollution and the fossil energy supply ?these thoughts are moving in the background .i m convinced that the arabic countries still have enough oil supply for the next 100 years .thus , our attitude towards car will not change rapidly in the next 20 years .the gasoline price will not reach the two dollar border .everybody will still not refrain from driving and buying a car .moreover the car industry is still growing .new cars are introduced every year .for example , the mercedes ml , which needs more than 20 litres pro 100 kilometres .another sign that the oil supply is still huge .you also have to consider that cars which drive with solar energy or a battery are still cars .they all will be count the number of cars which will not decline the next - at least - 20 years .
