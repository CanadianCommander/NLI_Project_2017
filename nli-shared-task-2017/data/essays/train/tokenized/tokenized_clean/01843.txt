`` work is the way of life  this is what i think for any young man / women .yes i agree with the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older one .life is a big experience , we encounter various situations both pleasent and unpleasent one , but they help us in maturing our qualities to tackles various hurdles in life .in my opinion youth are the one who enjoy their life more than any older person .i always rememeber the days when my grandfather told me to enjoy every part of this young life with full enthusiasm and cheerfulness .he also said me that `` life is not the bed of roses , often there are thorns  so enjoy your every part of this life may be you get number of problem .you are young , this is the time which will develop the fruitful experience in you and shapened your abilities to see your professional life , married life .i think that only a young person firstly enjoy his college life , where he get true friend there , he will enjoy every moment in college functions , parties , late night outs .after completing your college life now you enter the world of professionalism , it does nt matter you are in which post as a manager or a engineer .a young person will definately enjoy the responsibilities to complete a project , risk taking nature and willingness to succeed than other .then comes your married life , you can share you every moment of love , sorrow , you get a partner for whole of the life time .what all you enjoy with your partner at the begening of married life is always plays a important role in anybody life .this is the time when you get the responsibilities of your children and family .you have to manage all the thing job and family simultaneously .lastly i would like to say that life will show you different stages , childhood , younger , then older age .it depend on how you enjoy the life .life will always tend you to face various situations .but it is only the true experience and you inner emotions how you want to enjoy your life .
