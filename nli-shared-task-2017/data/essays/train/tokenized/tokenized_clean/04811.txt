we are living in a time in wich money is the most important thing .not one of , the most !often we measure the social importance of a person by measuring the amount of money he/she posseses . ..and it does nt matter whether what we sell is good , usefull , ealthy or not .it is only important we sell it , in order to earn as much as possible and get very important and famous in our society .experts call it business and some times society improvement .but if we think a little more deeply , we realize it is not that .to reach this goal , we use all the tools we can .one of the most effective means is television .by using tv and its tricks , experts are able to persuade people to by things they do not need at all !!great !!everybody knows often advertisements make products brighter than they actually are , but when we are in supermarkets , shops , etc , we forget it . ..it is a magical !i can see that even with some friends of mine .they change mobile very often , but not because their mobile does nt work any more : just because the new one has got more capabilities . ..and they realize they are stupid only when i ask them if they need those new functions . ..they do nt . ..and the sadest part of the story is that , often , the most usefull product are not supported by rich companies and thus they ca nt get known and spread .while stupid and useless products never keep unknown , as they would deserve : there is always a rich company which sponsorises and spreads them !what a pitty !!
