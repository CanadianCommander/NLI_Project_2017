its a fact , that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .the newer generations are at an advantage when you think of the luxuries , comforts .the new inventions and rapidly developing technologies are resposinble for this .these are the factors which are very attractive and young people forget their prime duties towards the community which includes their family , school , college , locality and the town or city wherever they live .world has become very competitive , you ca nt be successful unless you are calibred and you have exceptional talents .in order to resist this , the adults and parents are busy in their works and not giving enough attention and time to motivate the younger ones to perform their prime duties .in a way , most of the young people lack in guidance and motivation to help one another .the influences of certain movies make the young people think wild and a few sports like w.w.f. , gradually turn the young people to start thinking that they are real heroes and thus their thoughts are diverted towards wrong ways .internet , its a bliss for this generation - but in the same time , its often misused too .young children , thesedays love to spend their time with computer in the form of games , chatting and some kids in browsing the bad websites also , which are easily available .in the process , the young children are busy with school , homework , time with computer , etc , they spend whole day .they do not find any time to mingle with the friends of their age and thus they do not develop any kind of attachment to one another .at times , we get to see some children growing in certain families with least attention and love , who gradually turn very materialistic and help in no way to their community .every adult and parents must take up this task as important one and start thinking about the future world .they must motivate the younger ones to work towards helping their community , starting from home , school in whatever they way they can .
