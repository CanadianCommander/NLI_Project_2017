today , cars are the easiest way to travel .the car is just one of the differents way to travel .it s probably the easiest one , but not the cheapest .in a first time i ll explain the differents postive point of the car , in a second time , i ll describe the others way to travel , and in a third point compare both of them .today the car is the easiest way to travel .to go from a point a to a point b. even for short trips we take the car .the cars get better and better day after day .most of the teenagers are just waitting for oine thing , a car .they are able to go wherever they want , whenever they want and they do nt have to ask their parents , people feel that they are getting more freedom with a car .we do nt have any rushes when we take our car , we leave whenever we want .the car is less stressful than the others way to travel .the car is not the only way to travel .there is the train , the plane , the bicycle , even by foot for the most courageous of us .the train and the plane are a safe way to go from a point a to a point b. but the plane is pretty expensive , but it s getting cheaper .but the train is not very expensive and it s very easy to take a train , you do nt even have the stress of the road or getting an accident .and today , we want to get things without any effort .so the train is a very good way .in twenty years , a lot of things will change .even right now things are changing and they are going to have an impact on our futur as the price of gaz , safety on the road . ..the train or the plane become very cheap , it s not hard to find a plan ticket from paris to london for 20 $ .i think in twenty years it s going to be better .so the car is going to be the most expensive way to travel .i think , in the futur , we will still have a car .but we are not going to use it as many times as we do .most of the big cities are getting better in transportation ( bus , metro , rental bike ) .so i m not agree with this statement , we will still have a car but we will not use it very often , so one car will probably be enough for a family .
