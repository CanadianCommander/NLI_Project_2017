young people enjoy life more than older people do .i disagre to this statement .i have 1 reason to support my opinion .the way of younger people and older people has diffrent ways of enjoying there lifes .from younger people , what the olders do does nt look so enjoyfull .i think that is because youngers have many things diffrent from the olders have .like strenth and ideas they have .when a younger people spends a day , they can do lots of diffrent things .for example , they can do any sports they want to do like soccer , tennis and any things even hard sports like american foot ball .but when a older people spends the day , what day can do is limited .for example , they ca nt do hard sports that move around lot , they ca nt travel as much as the youngers and lots of ather things and what they can do is like sleep , have some walk , have a chat with freinds , stay home and somethings like that .when people look at this and had to choice from two of them , i think allmost all of the people will serect what the younger does because it looks more intertaint then what the olders do .allmost everybody thinks young people enjoy life more than older people do but it is nt right .it look as if how the olders spend there life is boring .but for the oldres , it is nt boring .it is enjoyfull .i can say that because it is not what you can do is enjoyful , it is
