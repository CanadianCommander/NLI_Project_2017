in today s highly mobilized society , cars have become an indispensible part of daily life .it is now common in most families to have multiple cars , one for each member of the family .however , while enjoying the innumerable advantages that cars bring to their lives people are becoming more and more aware of the down sides of having so many cars .considering this point , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the future than there are today .the biggest price that today s societies are paying for the convenience of having so many cars is definitely the deteriorating environmental conditions .cars probably have the largest contribution to air pollution among all the technological advancements that we can think of .in the recent years , on the other hand , environmental awareness has been awakened by means of international treaties , scientific research and public advertising .in my opinion , therefore , these efforts will have far reaching consequences and make future generations more sensitive on the issue .what effects an individual directly , however , is not the global environment that he must do his part to protest but more than that the expenses that comes along with having a car .as the organic energy sources on the planet diminish , oil prices will keep increasing , possibly at higher rates .in the end , it will probably reach such to limits where people will be willing to give up their comfort in favor of their pocket .the final point that i d like to make to support my argument is the gigantic technological advencement that we are witnessing in the fields of computers and the internet .nowadays , one can work , buy , sell , communicate , read the daily paper and do much more on his computer without leaving the house .this , however inadvantageous it might be for the health of the society , will surely have an effect in cutting down the number of cars that people have .after all , what s the point of having a car if you are only going to use it once a year to take it to the mechanic for its annual check ?
