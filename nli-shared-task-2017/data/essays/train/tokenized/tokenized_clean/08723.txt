in terms of limited availabilty concerning natural resources , which is a common topic nowadays , this is quite an interesting question .in the following i will proceed by depicting several arguements and ideas , either supporting or speaking against this statement .as already mentioned shortly above , resources which are necessary for a car , such as gasoline , do only exist on to a certain time in the future .some specialists state that oil will be sufficient for at least another 50 years , others calculated only 15 years .with our todays technology , hardly any car will drive once these resources have been wasted .therefor , the number of cars may have declined significantly in 20 years .a further point supporting the statement is the fact of growing environmental pollution .in order to save our planet , people will have to reduce emissions , for instance by driving around in car less often .instead people could rely on public transport .on the other hand , there is a remarkable trend towards a growing number of cars in the world .nations like china or india for example still have only a very low percentage of car owners among their inhabitants .while economy and prosperity in these countries are growing rapidly , the number of cars is growing even faster .and this trend is not going to weaken within the next years .besides , new technologies are developed permanently .one common example in terms of the automobile market is the solar energy .already today , solar energy is used in car technology and presumeably it is only a question of time when these new generation of vehicales is available on the market .from my point of view , there is another very important fact one should consider .over the last 100 years , since henry ford started to produce cars in huge quantities , the car has become a normal thing to own for people in the industrialized countries , representing a certain comfort and as well a status of social recognition .obviously people will be unwilling to up things like cars just in order to safe our resources or environment !altough resources are limite and a growing number of cars will mostlikely not be a support in order to save the nature , i am absolutely convinced that the number of cars will increase within the next 20 years .peolpe will always find a way to stay mobile , mostly through new technoligies .
