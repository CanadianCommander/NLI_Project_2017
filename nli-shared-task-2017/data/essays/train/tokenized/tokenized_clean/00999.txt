i do not agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts.  , because this statement generalizes that ideas and concepts are always more important than facts .as a student there are always classes that contain for huge parts of facts , for example history .other subjects , for example psychologie , concentrate on ideas that have to be prooven later on .in deed it is important to always have a general idea what somebody is explaining and to understand how a concept works , but using a concept practically without having the knowledge of the important facts around and behind the idea is mostly not possible .for example : it is good to understand the concept of a war , but that includes not from when till when it actually happend , what the factic conseqences were .a concept is always just fifty percent of reality , the other fifty percent are the facts that set it into context .on the otherhand would it be almost useless to collect all the facts about for example the second world war , if you have no idea about the causes ; the ideas and concepts each party of this war had .with only one , fact or concept it is neither possible to completly understand something nor to make the step from the idea to reality .therefore my opinion is , that understanding a concept is for students as important as the facts surrounding the concept .both must be understood to realize a topic .
