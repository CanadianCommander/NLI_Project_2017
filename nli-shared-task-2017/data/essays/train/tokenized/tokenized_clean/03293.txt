although some students can not understand ideas and concepts until they learn facts , ideas and concepts have more value for all students to learn than facts .understanding ideas and concepts is the first step of studying .for example , at the beging of studying new thing , a teatcher may give its concept first and then tell facts as an example .this can happen many times especially in chemistory class .firstly a teacher tells a theory , and then students clarify that the theory is correct in a lab class .this is because to understand chemical experiences , understaning the theory is the neccessary step for students .if students take a lab class first , they cannnot understand anything even if what they are doing in the class .thus , teacing concepts and ideas must be the first step of classes .however , it is also the truth that there are some students who can not under stand concepts only in explanations by theachers .for the students who can not understand whole of a lecture , this sequence can also work because there is no students , who can not understand any part of leacture , in class .during lecture , all students can catch at least so words , which are mainideas and helpful to understand ideas .if a teacher write these important words and drow some pictures on a black board , all students can write and drow them on their notes .after a lab class , they can review their notes and will be familiar with the ideas .therefore , for this kind of studens , this is very helpful .
