with the statement of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , diferenr people have defierent ideas depending on their own personalities and personal experience .and in my view , i most like to agree with the statement .i know it is irrational to assert an point without anlyzing , so i ll get a help of my own experience .last summer holiday , some friends with me have a travelling to the beautiful coast city dalian , which locates in the nothereast of china .the reputation of dalian is very good in china , and surely we are all delitly for the chance of travelling to the beautiful city .but things not always go on as we wished .as the strangers , we are exciting for its fatastic landscape while arriving in dalian .for the sake of saving money , we have nt hire a guide , and we thought a map could handle .the coming things prove that we are wrong absolutely .soon after the exciting , the sunset s coming , we faced the problem of accomodation .the summer is the best season for touring in dalian , thus all the rooms are reserved .at last we only ask for helps from taxi driver , and eventually he sent us to a hotel in suburan , which locates far from the city center .in the following days , we are all depressed , as a result of withouting a tour guide , we just paid most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in dalian is not terrible .we just searched our routine all the time .hence , it is really a low quantity travelling .in otherwise , if we have the travelling with a guide , the situation will be better .first of all , we can easy cope with the accomodation and routines .what s more , once we have a tour a famous place , we just know it is famous but have no sense of why it is so prestige .therefore , if i will travel to another city or place i m not familar with , i ll set up accompany with a guide for certain .travelling is just like the studying , and the guide is like the teacher , when we have problems we well ask helps from teachers , and role of the guide is the same in travelling .
