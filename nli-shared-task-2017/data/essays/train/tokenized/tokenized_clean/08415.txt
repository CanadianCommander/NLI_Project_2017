in my opininon , the statement does nt represent the reality in a completely way .i am agree about the fact that the number of cars is increased today , but i disagree when it is said that cars were fewer twenty years ago .during the eighties there were many cars , a lot of traffic and the hustle and the dustle like in our nowadays cities .therefore there was pollution in the air and also an acoustic one .obviously pollution increased during the years and today it has reached an alarm level , especially in big cities like milan or rome .i know this fact because i live in milan where the air is really heavy and streets are full of noise and waste .thus i go to the countrysyde , when i have the possibility , in order to live some days in a natural atmosphere .i think that our enviromental conditions is terrible .one reason for the increase of pollution depends on the fact that today a family uses often two or more cars , because maybe is necessary for working or for reaching other places .although i think that every person could contribute to improve the situation by using the underground or other public transports .the only positive aspect of today s situation is the help offered by technology which has modified specific parts of new cars and the engines in order to control the emissions of toxic gases and to decrease pollution .twenty years ago these solutions did nt exist and cars emitted all toxic and dangerous gases and other substances .
