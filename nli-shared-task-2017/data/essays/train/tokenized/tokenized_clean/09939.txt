in the world there is a great market of exange in which people have to do many choices buying a product .so it is difficult for a single company to get a considerable part of this market to take advantage from it .so i think that a common method used by a company to reach a wider part of the market is that to use advertisiments .an example supporting this statement is that a company presents a product in a way thanks to which you see it better .you know only the good qualities and not what is wrong with the product .this is the purpose of advertisiments , to enchant yourself in a lot of different ways such as using famous actors like people who use that product .on the other hand , a company should use an expert to present its product saying him to enphasize the new concept of the product .i know from experience that advertisiments make products seem much better than they really are .for example , one time i ordered a product by internet because i was very fascinated by the way in which it was described .but when i had had that product at home i was very unhappy because the product did not function as it was described .this was a very bad surprise for me .another common method used by advertisiments is that of fulling the page of a newspaper or the screen of the television with a lot of colours .in this way , people  s attention is focuzed not on the product but on other things .it is a very successiful practice .summing up , i think that advertisimets change the real characteristics of a product in order to convince many other people to buy that object or that solution .for me , this is a very bad way to sell and to trade a product .using these methods , companies make only tricks on people and before or after they will be discovered .on the other hand , the best advertisiment for a product is its good qualities .
