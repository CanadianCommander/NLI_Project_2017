in today s life advertisements are everywhere , they are part of everyone s life .everytime we go to a mall , we recognize some of products we see because we have already seen them on a commercial .advertisements play a fundamental role in marketing : they tell people what is worth buying and what not .most of the times the wonderful shiny product we can appreciate on a commercial is not what we expected it to be once we buy it .that s the power of advertising , and that s why industries would pay several million dollars , for instance , to get a 10 seconds advertisement space during the american football superbowl .why would someone pay so much for ten seconds ?it s quite easy to understand . ..i do agree with the fact that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are , and i think this is quite understandable .people would never buy a product which can be classified as `` normal  .people need to improve their life by owning something better every day .i believe this is a psychological strategy , and industries do exploit it to make their income grow as much as possible .sometimes i think that those who create commercials do nt believe their own words , or maybe do .maybe an advertisement is good when its own creator can tell what s real from what s a lie .in my opinion , advertisements , particularly those based on lies , must not be trusted at all , even though it is also true that the customer really ca nt avoid beeing the victim of this strategy .the customer has the right and the need to tell the good product from the bad one , in order to save money and buy what is best for him , not for those who sell these products .
