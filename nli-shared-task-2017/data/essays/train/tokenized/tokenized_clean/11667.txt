making so generel a statement ( such as `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  ) can only lead to an ambiguous answer : one can not divide the world so easily .it appears theoretically right to say that young people enjoy more life ; i would say they have less reasons to be bitter : they have not yet been confronted to the affliction .for example they do nt know about the wounds of love , the stress of work or the responsibilites of adult life like monetary preoccupations .children have much to learn and their ignorance protects them from unhappiness .but it is this same ignorance that rules their somehow unstable behaviour : unhappiness ( manifested through abundance of tears , screams ) can hit them for an unimportant reason .a child who sees his parents go for work might seem to have seen them die , crying for long minutes ; their despair is intense .this emotional unstability has another side : unhappiness does rarely last and the crying child can be seen a few minutes later playing and laughing .older people feel sadness differently and it changes their overall happiness in various ways : some will bear with pain the numerous difficulties they have encountered in their life ; they will accumulate and eventualy they will spend all day thinking about their preoccupations or afflictions , neglecting the simple pleasures of life .a grown-up man will think about the girlfriend he just lost and think that there is no happy love ; he will see his parent grow old ant think of death , of the vanity of life .but on the opposite hand a man with the same background can react very differently : if he has a philosophical temper , he will not fear death and think of a forthcoming love ; the thunderous atmosphere in his workplace will seem mundane , because they have seen it twice , thrice and more .nothing surprises him and he lives in serenity , or at least he knows how to deal with the pains of life .to say that young people enjoy more life than older people can be true , but we must add that young people suffer more intensely from life and its small details than grown-ups .older people normally have a more linear behaviour , generally sad when they do nt know how to gauge the importance of what affects them , generally happy when they do .
