advertising is the art of encourage a customer to buy a product instead of another one having the same qualities .therefore , it should not be surprising at all that , sometimes , advertisements can make a product seems much better than it really is .toys , snacks and mobile phone services are three kind of products that are not usually as good as you may think after having seen their advertisements .last year , i decided to buy a new mobile phone , and so i also had to change my service provider .since i did nt have enough time to compare all the offers available on the market , i decided to make my decision just looking at the advertisements .i choosed a provider that offered one hundred minutes of free calls every month .one month later , when the first bill arrived , i discovered that this offer was valid for international calls only , and not for national ones .for sure , i did nt get what i paid for .when i was a kid , i once asked my parents to buy for me a new bike .i did nt want a traditional bike , but a bmx , which was the most popular model at that time , mainly due to a big advertising campain on tv and newspaper .the result ?my parents bought that bike , which , by the way , was also really expensive , and it got broken after just three weeks .it seemed literally unbreakable on tv . ..there is not a big difference from one snack to another .if someone gives you an hamburger , i bet that you wo nt be able to tell in which fast food it has been purchased .indeed , advertisements can make a snack seems better than another one .for example , you may think that , since a beverage has been promoted by a celebrity , it is better than a less famous one .the truth , however , is that they are practically equal , and that , if a difference exists , it is almost unnoticeable .products are not always as good as advertisements may suggest .i had bad experiences in my life when i had to purchase a product , and now i do nt trust in advertisements anymore .when i need to buy a new object , i ask for suggestions to someone who has already bought it , or i just wait for a few months .time only will tell me if a certain product worths its price or not .
