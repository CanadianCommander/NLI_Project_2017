i totally agree that most advertisements often make products seem and sound better than the actually are .there are meany reasons why adevertisements seem that way .first , because those product makers want to target and attract the biggest amount of people , they will try their best to `` putify  their products by using colore and mainly by using attracting words .mostly the will use words and expressins like `` 99 % guranteed ,  and  it will change your life  .one good example of a product the uses colorful attracting words if a beauty product called `` aveeno  .on it written , `` recomended by dermatologiestes .it will make , not it makes , your skin very soft , it will whiten it and will give you a beautiful skin for a life long .my wife have been using this product for a preiode of few years and i never noticed any changes .asecond reason is that dvertisers use tricky and misleading words like `` help  , and `` aim  or 99.99 % , never 100 % .by using these words , they make their product more convencing to the customers and consumers , especially hopeless people who tried other product , but did not get any positive results , will run after thrie products .as an example , i have been complaining of teeth [ problems for few years and i tried different kinds of toothpaste .i was attracted by one of those kinds called called `` crest senstivity  .i used this product for a long time , but my teeth never get better unti i was seen by a dentist who clarified to me that the use of a toothpaste may help in some xcases but not in all .after he examined my teeth he said that i had a bad infection which can not be treated merely with any of the tooth paste brands .instead he said i need to have a clinic treatment at different sessions .my visit to the dentist confirms that product advetisers use fake and misleading words which do not give enough information to the customers .to conclude , in the field of advertisement and promotion , advertisers use colorful words and expressions , fake and misleading words and umproven facts just for the sake of attracting customers and consumers and selling the biggest amount and making more money .
