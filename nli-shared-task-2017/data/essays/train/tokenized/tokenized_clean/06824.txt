i very much agree with the statement .research , development and innovation are certainly the keys to success in modern and developed economies .it seems to me quite obvious that people who dares to take risk and try new things are successful people .if nobody tries to risk the economy will never be competitive .however , i would add that , once you take a chance and dare to risk you must prove that you are actually capable of keeping that success .in other words , trying new things and taking risks will only make you successful if learn how to run well your new business .we live in a world which is becoming more and more a global village and the new economies like china , india , taiwan and south korea are becoming more and more competitive compared to the countries of the so called developed world .developing countries can produce what we can already produce with very low wages , which is why we have to compete with them in terms of innovation and new things .in order to be successful you have to do something well but you can not just do that .i will make an exemple to make my position clearer : milano , the city where i live in , is famous all over the world for the fashion and furniture industries .clothes and furniture are very easy to copy , so if we want to compete and keep a leading position in these sectors we have to add some extra that can not be found in products made elsewhere .it may sound strange but innovation and research can be found and have to be extended to fashion and design industries as well .the point is that the success that italian products have all over the world is mostly due to the fact that we can do some things well and better than others , and we have to keep this leadership .this makes me think that keeping on doing well what you already can do is as important as trying new things .as usual , both aspects are important .
