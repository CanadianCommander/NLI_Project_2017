do i think that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than nowadays ?it will be marvellous , but it will not be happened .there are several reasons that substain my thought .a )past years  trend .in the period 1980 - 2000 , the number of cars bought in the industrialized countries has increased .every year new models are sold , cars are cheaper than in the past , new tecnologies are built inside ( airbags , abs , an so on ) .new laws have be iussed by goverments requiring more specific characteristics .all these reasons have increased the number of new cars b )new countries are becoming industrialized and rich ( see china , india ) .those countries have millions of habitans that in the future will require the use of new cars .do you immagine what does it mean a new car for each chinese ?how many car will be sold ?what kind of business will be ?c )oil energy is not considered to be finishing .in the past years the issue of oil reserves was considered a world s great problem .but now , new drilling tecnologies have been discovered , more reserves have be found , so at the moment this issue is not considered imminent .d )people have to move faster than in the past .very often , peole find a job far form their own houses .for that reason they have to use trains , buses , planes and cars every day .how will they be able to get to work without their own cars ?it s a great deal , how can be solved if we would want to reduce the number of cars ?on the other hand , if the number of cars will increase , enviromental issues will grew up .pollutions is the most important .new forms of energies will have to be found to move the new cars .
