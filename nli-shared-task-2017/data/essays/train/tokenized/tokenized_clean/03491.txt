succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in first i think who it  s very important to take risks or try new things because the innovation it is the best quallity for pass in the life .for example if i open a restaurant i would like who he is different of others restaurants .it is very important who are difference between my restaurant and the others .the most quality of one cretors it is a innovation .in second it  s true who take risks and try new things it s not a good idea because it is very dangerous .if i open a restaurant with a new concept it s not mentionned that i will have a good results at the begining .it is a risk : we take it or we not take it .i understand that people try new things and take risks but i think who it is very dangerous but we must try or take risks for pass in the life .
