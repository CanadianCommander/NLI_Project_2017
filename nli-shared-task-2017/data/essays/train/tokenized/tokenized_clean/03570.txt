i agree with this satement .let me say definition of car first .according to our common sense car is a kind of transportation .it has a wheel and engine to make power .it consumes gasoline or disel .this is traditional concept of car that we knew .but in the future those definitions are can change .for example , future car can move without wheel and driver .may be it dose nt have to run on the street .future car can use solar power , elecrticity and water .it will be semi-airplane .but shape look like a car and function will be quiet diffrent .sometimes we see in sf-movies like `` star-wars  .these days air pollution is becomes big issue in this world .main cause of air pollution is a car .many motor companies are developing electric car and hydrogen car .it can be a solution for reducing air pollution .but still it is not a popular car .price is very high and function is not perfect .however within ten years it will be more popular car than present .modern hig-technology is changing rapidly .think about computer and electronics .it ca nt compare with just ten years before .changing is more faster than our imagination .i believe that ten years of tufure has same value of era with 50 years of past .it means twenty years of our future has same value with one century .during last ten decases how much changed our world ?it was really beyond our immagination .we will experience again , those kind of rapid changing in our culture within twenty years .therefore i can say twenty years later we will use diffrent kind of transportation with car .i do nt know what we call future transportation .but it will be diffrent with traditional cars .traditional cars we will see in the museum .
