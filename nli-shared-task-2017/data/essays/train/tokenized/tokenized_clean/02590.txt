enjoing life` `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my openion i think it s not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .happiness does nt come by age it comes by satesfactionyou may find a young man who can do every thing he wants but at the end he is not happy .or you may also find a young man who he is not happy because he does nt have the aportunity to get maried and to creat a familly .enjoing life is not about doing things that will make you feel younger .you may find an old person who he enjoys eech second he spends in this world by seeing his grandchildren .it depend through the persons intrest .for example my father is an old man who have grandchildren but he is enjoing his life by spending time with his family and taking care of his house .his happiness when he sees his children and espescialy me because i am the youngest getting high grades in school .this is what happiness mean .
