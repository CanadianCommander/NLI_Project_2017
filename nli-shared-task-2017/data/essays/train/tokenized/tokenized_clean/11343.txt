a community needs the help of every members to be a nice and pleasant place to live in .young people have to participate like any other members , have to give the same time like anyone else .i think that they do that but maybe they do not do the same thing as an adult and maybe adults do not see what they do .young people do things they like to do .that can be a problem because , as young people , they accept less easily things to do than an adult who now that he does it for the well being of the community .youg people like to do things they like .the problem is that adults often think that what young people are doing is less important than what they are doing .so for example , when there is a party to oragnise in the community , young people will be happy to organise it , but as it it less serious than something than adults can do , it is not considered like it has to be considered .young people have not the same vision of a community like adults .times are changing and adult-s idea of a community is not the same as a young people-s idea of a community .young people can show their love for their community by writing a song about it , or bye painting grafitiy on walls about it , so that is is pratical help like adults do , but in the mind of zoung people it is a kind of engagment for this community .so i think that youg people do things and give enough time for their community but in a different way than adults , but i do not think that what the adults do are more important than what young people do .
