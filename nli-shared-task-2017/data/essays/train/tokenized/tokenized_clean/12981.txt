i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are several reasons for saying this .the group tour is not only convineant but also efficent .first of all , i can gain more information about visiting places easlly although i should accept a rule that is made by guide .for example , when i went to japan alone , i was confused because i could not know that were taking subway or how i can go to hotel .therefore , provided information by a guide is more convineant for my trip .in addition , group tour is not expenssive than along because a tour guide provides useful information .also , i can choose reasonable restaurant and shop .saving my money is more efficent for me because i am able to prepare suvinior for my families and friends .finally , i can make relationship other tourist .it can be useful experience .whereas , if i went to foreign country , i could stay alone .for example , when i went to france in group tour , i have met a friend who is there are reasons why i choose a group led by a tour guide .
