i am totally disagree with this idea .there are some key reasons for the disaggrement .in today s world , developments continue at very high rate , so this circumstance requires dividing the subjects into some number of parts .this is also valid for academic subjects , since academic life is directly related to development process .you must look at the procedings , provide some new idea and make it real .this means that you will add someting that will be work on it for the further time , maybe it will be another subject which will be considered as a new branch .the main reasons can be listed as diversity of a subject , the new ideas on them and turning the idea to real .first of all , we can examine the situation of expansion of the subject that is a academic one .today every academic person works to provide some inventions or developments about their fields .what is the way of solving problems about a subject that is studied ?the most effective way of this is dividing it into some reasonable number of parts .for instance , think about the biology , it is a huge area that academic people work on it , but when you look at the academic life , you can see one important thing which is the subject has been divides into many parts such as microbiology , plant systems , genetic science etc .we can find many other subjects that are worked on them , today .why did they divide the subject ?actually , the answer is obvious , many people work on it and the area is expanded , to solve the problems as quicky as possible you must work like a team that the members work for a specific part of it .secondly , we can think the situation that is alive about new ideas .actually , this is about the expansion process , but we must think this as separate part .academic people works on many subjects and they try to put some new ideas into the field .how can affect these ideas the division process ?the new ideas mean the new woorking areas , think the one of the most invention called computer and its acedemic side .the computers came out from the electrical and electronical progress .that is , the people who study for the development of electrical process thougt an idea about usage of electricity as bits ( 1 and 0 ) in the scale of current .after this idea , the related academic filed started to thinking it and provided some other developed ideas that required to create a new branch of study .so , they divided the electrical and electronical field into two .this is also valid for today and we can combine this approach with the development process .because , these new successfull research theories .new developments have gone out .that is , all of them like the example make the area bigger and bigger .as a result , this needs a division for being faster about academic improvements .finally , we must aware of the process that is division is neccessary for being developped at a higer rate .this makes me being disaggre with the idea that is stated .
