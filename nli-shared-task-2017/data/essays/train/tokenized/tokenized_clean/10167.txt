as i have never had the opportunity to study one specific subject , i do nt really know how it is like , but i will try to imagine it the best that i can , comparing its advantages to those of the other alternative .a student who attend an university course have to do an important choose , he had to decide if specializing in one specific matter or not .i thinks that specializing in one specific subject is necessary in a lot of camp , for examples for a medic or engineering .in fact , is impossible to arrive at an high livel of knowledge in many matters .on the other hand , exsist the risk of a wrong choose about the subject of specialization .i know many person that have changed the university a lot of time , and this may become very dangerous for the career .it is also important have a complete view about an argument or a problem , and only a broad knowlodege of many academic subjects allows that .so , after looking at all these different advantages for both the sides , it is very hard for me to come a conclusion .i guess the the best solution is to specializing in few subjects .
