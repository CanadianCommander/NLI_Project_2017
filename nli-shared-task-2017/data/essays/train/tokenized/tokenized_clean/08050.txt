some people argue if it is a general truth that it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than facts .but to be frank , i totally think the ideas and concepts is more important than the facts .here are numerous reasons why i agree with this statement .understand the ideas and concepts is way more important than just learning the facts .both ideas and concepts are the two main elements for students to understand what is going on and explain what is happening during their learning period .it is like havin a good background always make yourself more succesfull .for example , my best friend and i both doin well in the english class , but when we were testing on our toefl , he got lots higher marks than me .becuase he understnad the ideas and concepts .and i am nwhen students have a good understanding of ideas and concepts based on the subject they are doing .normally it helps them to learn faster , and able to memorized it .most of the test questions came from one simple idea or concept , teachers just make changes to the question to make it looks more tough .for those students who understand the basic ideas or concepts can easily answer the questions .on the other hand , for those students that only understand the facts can easily be fool and not get the answer correct .to sum up all of the examples aboves , i definatly agree understand ideas and concepts is more important than just lean the facts .
