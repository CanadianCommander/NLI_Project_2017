there are much more things that students must know than the students used to must know .especially after industrial revolution , in the area of engineering science there have been lots of development .some are not used anymore , some are still being used .if it is used , students have to have knowlegde about that .however there are so many thing which students have to know that it can not be given into a single person .so learning ideas and concepts is more important than to learn ideas for two reasons .first , it is the idea that create facts .all the facts come from a inventor or from a group of inventor .they have got first the idea , then try it and see whether it works or not .if students know the concepts , they can know where inventor made things wrong .actually , this is the way of development .for example , for all people know that if apple falls from a tree , it hits the earth , but newton asked why .from this point of view , he got another idea from a fact and created another fact .as in this example it is beneficial students to learn ideas in order to increase their creativity .secondly , as mentioned above , there are lots of things to learn .in a limited time period students learn either some facts and its applications very well or ideas and concepts of many thing .second one sounds better .the reason why second one sounds better is because of globolization .if a person has some ideas about a issue , he or she can many available information about that issue on the library or on the internet .so the only thing is to know basic concepts of an argument .
