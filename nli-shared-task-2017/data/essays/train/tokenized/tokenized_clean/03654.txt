this question is not easy to answer .on the one hand , i think understanding ideas and concepts is very important .on the other hand , i think learning facts is also very necessary .understanding ideas and concepts , mainly determines or belongs to evolving a good sound knowledge .a good understanding of such ideas and concepts is always a basic component of a sound knowledge .ideas and concepts may be taught in a very casual way , so that students can remember such ideas and concepts easier .perhaps they re using quizzes or games , for example .learning should not consist of just learning facts by heart .of course , pupils and students have to learn some important facts , for instance , geographical or historical facts .it is proved that pupils who have to learn only facts may have good or even excellent results in exams , but they also tend to forget things faster .if pupils understand ideas and concepts , of what they have been taught , they can reproduce it more quickly .they see basic relations between different ideas , concepts and aspects .they probably wo nt forget things as fast as pupils do who only learned facts .reproduction is a very important part of the learning process .as long as you can reproduce ideas and concepts , you know or you are able to understand what you have been taught so far .by way of conclusion , i think students should have both , an understanding of ideas and concepts and learned fact .the mixture is important .emphasis should be on the understanding .a basis must be designed and this basis must be completed with single facts , which students have to learn .but , the facts can not be missed out .it would be unthinkable to know the ideas of , for example , the french revolution , but not knowing when this event took place .the same with geography , it is good to know the customs and habits of , for instance , japan , but you also have to know were it is situated .so , as mentioned before there should be an approbriate balance between both , understanding and learning .
