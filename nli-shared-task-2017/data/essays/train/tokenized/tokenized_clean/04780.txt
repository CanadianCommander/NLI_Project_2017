i disagree with the fact that in twenty years time there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .infact i believe that their numbers would have gone up ten times .cars have become the most basic and primary modes of transport in the world today .from the time they were introduced until now , their numbers have gone up exponentially and there has been no decline in their sales .providing both riding comfort and safety , cars have become the basic necessity for all and for some it has evolved to become a fashion statement and an article of pride .people now a days , are in the false belief that the use of cars might stop in future because the petroleum reserves are slowly getting exhausted .but what they fail to realise that petroleum is no longer the only source of power that can drive the vehicle .after years of research new technoligies have been devloped realising this danger hybrid cars are already being produced and marketed .so are electrically driven cars .however some researchers are working on using hydrogen as a fuel .sucess in this will be the biggest break through ever in the field of automobile engineering .hydrogen is available is abundance and it also has a very high calorific value .thus capable of producing greater power than petrol driven vehicles .in addition to this the problem of pollution is also solved as , the only exhaust that would come out of a hydrogen driven vehicle would be water .twenty years is a lot of time and by then this technology would have not only been tested but would be driving the entire world .seeing the latest innovations in this field , cars with better looks and aerodynamics are being manufactured .in twenty years time concept cars , which have already taken a start , would be in full production .our world is full of people who admire beauty , safety , comfort and most of all technology .thus making cars not a curse of the past but refined gift for the future .
