it is not easy to say which is the better approach , but i personally do not agree with the statement , because i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject .i say this for two main reasons .the first reason is that it is more practical for students .i mean , if you can concentrate on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lots of things on that subject and you will be able to become prepared .but when i say `` more practical  i refer also to the fact that studing one subject instead of more than one is good for the student s path .i mean , once a student has entered the subject he should know what that subject requires , what the important aspects are and he would be able to organise his studies in the best way .maintaining your mind open to a lot of subjects is a big effort .it is true that keep your mind open could be a good thing , giving you a wide range of knowledge , but the question is if this knowledge will be useful in your future .this question brings me to expose the second reason that supports my opinion .i argue that specialising will be useful for working .companies , or institutions , usually do not hire people who have a generalistic approach , that know a lot of things , but that remain on the surface of them .companies require people to be expert in something and to become an expert you have to get into things , to discover all the aspects , to prevent all the problems .as for my personal experience i have to say that i m in a class with a very generalistic approach and i think it is not good .i m glad that i ve got a solid basic culural background , but i am sincerely worried about my future .you could ask me why i am in such a class and the answer would be that i do not know .when i chose my class i thougth it was more specialistic , but i was wrong , but i think to be lucky as well because i had the opportunity to attend lots of intersting courses and to meet lots of good professors .
