now a days young people are more occupied with their needs and wants .they usually get less time to serve for their community .individualism is spreading across the globe and youngsters are getting most affected by it .they are becoming more selfish and care about only few people around them .this makes them indifferent to the problems of the community .the needs and wants of the young people are increasing at a very high rate .thus , they spend less time doing community work .the high level expectations of youngsters out of themselves make them study and work harder .this leaves them with less time to help others .though the young people are getting more conscious about their enviornment and people around them , they consider the problems associated with the community and the enviornment less important than their own problems .they consider personal enjoyment more important than societal development .this can be seen by example of lesser number of younsters who go for social service than number of youngsters who party quite often or study more .in some segment of society , young people now are more distracted by the modernization of the society .they prefer to go to a party or hang out with friends as compared to help their parents in their work .in other segment of the society , the decrease in concern for the community is also due to increased pressure from their parents .now parents are more concerned about future of their children and thus nurture them to study and work for more hours .this results in less interaction of the children with the society and hence , less concern for the community .the pressure from the society and parents make them introvert and selfish .but sometimes the youngsters do help their communities by inventing new things and implementing new ideas .for example , some young scientist may invent a machine which can efficiently remove hazardous materials from water in lesser cost .this invention does help society .youngsters now a days do not help their communities much .instead they prefer either to party or study .they have developed selfish attitude .though in some cases they help their communities indirectly by their inventions , but that happens occassionally .
