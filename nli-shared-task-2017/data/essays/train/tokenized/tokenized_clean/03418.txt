to tell the truth , i do not think that concepts are more important than facts .to my mind , both of them are significant and essential in a student s training .first at all , i am convinced that understanding concepts and ideas are really important for a student .indeed , learning facts can become very useless and it is impossible to understand those facts without understanding their origin .theory is essential in a student s training and a student can not devote his time on facts he can not understand .however , if a students only learn concepts , he rapidly has trouble likening experience and theory .consequently , i think it is very important to learn facts for many reasons .first , when a student learn facts , he can on the one hand , learn a situation , and on the other hand the mistakes made during this situation .furthermore , general knowledge is essential .first , in order to have his own opinion concerning a topic , and then , to liken those facts to an experience .for example , i am major in material .i have learnt a lot of facts concerning different microstructures , and when i carry out an experience , i can observe a microstructure i can easily liken to what i have learnt before .as a consequence , i think that in order to understand the theory , it is essential to learn facts .concepts are essential in a student s training but a students can not make the most of those concepts if he can not liken them to an experience .furthermore , general knowledge is essential to have his own opinion about a topic .to conclude , concepts and facts are not contrary notions .a student will be well educated insofar as his education draw a parallel between an understanding of ideas and concepts , and the facts which arise from those concepts .
