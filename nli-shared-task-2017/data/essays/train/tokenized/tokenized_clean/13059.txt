without any doubt iam strong agree with this statement because i see thiough my experences that we must keep our students understand any thing which we learnd to them not just give them the fact of any subject and , keep them to understand the fact with thierselves because they may do not anderstand the fact in the right way so this thing sure will make wast of our life .for example of my opinion : when we learnd the students about some thing such as learning or education it is very important thing and everyone should learn , when we told them these words just without make them like it do you know what this means ?this means that our chieldren may learn some time but , witgout beliving ant of information and the information do not keep in thier maind any more time after finshing thier high schools for example .another example is when i take with any one who wants to drive car about the methods of driving and saving others lives this person should understand exactly why i mean because if not he or she may drive fast so this will make a very big waste for all .in a word i think that understand any small thing in our students lives will save our lives and i thi thin ; thise the very important thing and , this the resposbilty of parents and teachers .
