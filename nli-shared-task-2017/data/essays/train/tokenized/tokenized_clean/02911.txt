nowadays advertise occupies a central position in our life .some person belive strongly in it , instead any other are sure that it can produces negative effectives in the quality of our life .in my opinion advertisments make products seem much better than they are in the reality , and so in the following paragraphs i try to explain my point of view .when we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easy see adverstiments ; they talk about food , for instance , or clothes , cars , bank services etc . .in all these situations the objects , or the products , appear beautiful , confortable and in same case chip , nethereless when we decide to buy one of them we have a surprise .for example , the last year i saw a beautiful photography machine in a television advertise , it seemed very small , easy to use and with a lot of different functions .in this way , i convinced my boyfriend to buy this model becuase i thought it was an incredible occasion , infact the price is not so high in relation wiht the quality .the day after he decided to buy this photography machine , and unfortunately my boyfriend and i , using it , understand that it use not so good .the same situation happens when we buy a food only for the fact that it is presented in a particular way in the advertise ; for example , the advertise uses a specif enviromental , color or situation to expain the caracteristics of the food , and as a consequence we immidiately decide to buy it .to sum up the adertisemntent make products seem more different and much better or more cheap than they are in the reality , and so we note the differerence unfotunately only when we decide to buy it , i think it is not right !
