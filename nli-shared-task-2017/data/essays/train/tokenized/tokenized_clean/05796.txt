as i am try to assess the state of the number of cars being used twenty years down the line , we can primarily look into the things that might actuallly be the core reasons , which can minimise the use of carsthe reasons i see for decrease in the number of cars is to decrease consumption of fuel as fuel is being scarce day by day , to decrease the environmental pollution , people looking for more faster means of transport , might become too expensive .as we can see the reasons , to decrease the consumption of fuel , there is no need to curb the use of cars instead we can try and invent new mean of fuel for ignition , for instance people have already started using cooking gas as fuel , but it is agreed that it is too dangerous as a small spark can ignite the whole vehicle , so research has to be made to develop furthur .and the ease of availability of the cooking gas is also specious , but there is definitely alternate way to produce fuelanother reason for decrease might be that maitaining a car might become too expensive , as the number of cars increased the consumption of fuel increased too , this led to decrease in the availability of fuel or over all depletion of the fuel in the world , this will lead to increase in available fuel cost .not only this for maitaining a car , we need a space to park it , increasing use of this means of trasport on metropolitan cities have decreased the availability of space , sometimes getting small amout of space is much more expensive than one can visualize .people might choose more reliable and faster means of trasport , may be some cheaper air transport .this not completely imaginative idea , but this already put to practice to create few planes which can be used by common people , if these bcome more compact , easier and faster means of transport people might well opt for the same , but this might not be possible in just twenty years .infact , i believe that there might be much more cars than the what we currently have , if the raise in the use of cars is considered .if we just consider the case of developing contries like india , the raise has been significant for the past twenty years .that can be seen from the fact that number of brands of cars that india used to have twenty years before and what it is now , and also the increase in the traffic level .may be developed countries might have already exhausted their use of cars in all their metropolitan cities , but we still have the scope to grow in the developing countries .another point that can be described is the fact that growing population needs increases the scope of travel , thus increases the number of mean of trasport that we use .as population of the world is defenitely in an increasing state , there will never be decrease in the number of means of transport they use .as car is the significant means of trasport in this modern world , there are prone to increase too .so , on the whole i believe that will never be fewer cars in this world than today , though
