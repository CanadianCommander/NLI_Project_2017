life is fun as long as we are young !in most family contexts , children until the age of 18 do nt have heavy responsabilities .all they questioned about is school , health care and family help .in the other hand , parents ( older people ) undergo all the family s responsability .ensuring feeding , clouthing , housing and so on , they do nt have at most times any mood for fun .childhood is the period where kids have to learn , to grow saffely and particularly to enjoy life .they do nt have to care about any of the life difficulties such as bringing food to the family , housing and security .instead , they are aload to play as much as they want , to get gifts from all the relatives and to learn what they enjoy the most besidse abligatory school .this time period gives to children the opprtunity to be free from all life problems , so thats how they enjoy most of life moments .assuming that the older people discussed are parents , they are the personnes who have to give the youngers the opportunity to have fun .being at work all day long , most parents see their jobs as a responsability and not as a source of fun .even if they can enjoy spending time with there colleags , there only one purpose is to be paied so that they can affoard to make joy at home .in addition to all that , a grown up person start to have a citizen obligations .olde people have to vote , to participate in the country activities and particularly stop having the right to make big mistakes .all in all , young people do have time to enjoy life more than older people for the most important reason , the lack of responsability thye have .at the time whene they start thinking about there feeling and purposes in life , they start to have less time to have fun especially once they make their families .
