as the modern society is developing faster and faster , more and more better facilities , interesting things that did nt happen in the old years appear , our youth is absolutely served more confortable than those older people in such world .3 aspects of reasons or exemples can be shown to support my vote for the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people .for instance , my city has just built an gorgeous play park where you can enjoy most excting and thrill play facilities .i have been there 3 times with my parents .every time when i immersed myself into those attractive play events my parents just sat there to look at me `` flying up and down  because they are a little bit of old for those play events , they may have some worries even a little fear toward them .as we all know , young people nowadays often prefer to do a lot of things on computer such as shopping , reading and sometimes studying through the internet .on the other hand , older people more often have trouble dealing with these machines which can bring a lot of convinience to our work , study and life .as a result , older people can only solve problem all by themselves .but how can they keep up the fast pace of the modern world with their lower efficient ?they will have less time to enjoy the beautiful life .as far as i was concern , young people are more adaptable to the quickly-changing world , they easily convert their thoughts of things ; they are more likely to change their attitudes towards life and the way of living .whenever newer and nicer things appear , the young will be the first to take them , follow them and enjoy them while older people always have cold feet to new things and always over thinking `` so-called  risks of those things .in conclusion , i raise both of my hands to agree with the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
