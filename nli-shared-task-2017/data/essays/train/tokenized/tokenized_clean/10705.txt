according to me , ideas and concepts form the base for successful understanding of a subject .facts are also important for subjects like history or biology .but having knowledge only of facts , student can not fetch much .facts can be developed if a student possess an understanding of ideas and facts .there are many daily life examples that would differentiate the importance between both .for example , let us consider a pocelin flower vase that is placed on a table at one corner of the house , a child may break it though hearing the fact that the porcelin would break .but , if a child has the idea regarding the product , if he has a knowledge about the charecteristics of porcelin then he would never break it .unless and until something happens accidentally .if students possess a background knowledge about a product or anything they would handle it with care .having knowledge of ideas and concepts would help students in their research work .with ideas and concepts they can enhance the existing theory and develop a new theory .facts are also important but possessing facts alone cant help students enhance an existing theory .having knowlede of facts holds good for subjects like history and political sciences .these are the subjects where dates have to be remembered .when talking about other subjects like computer sciences , it is necessary that students possess idead and concepts about the subject .for example when a team is woking on a project ( each person allocated different job ) and suppose a person leaves suddenly then it becomes the responsibility of the rest of the team to complete the project .this can be done if the students possess ideas and concepts regarding that part of the project whick is left by a person .hence the above reasons holds good in convaying that facts are important but ideas and concepts are important ,
