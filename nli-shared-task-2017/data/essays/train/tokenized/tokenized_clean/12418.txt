i disagreee this statement .because , i think it depends on people .i take one example and approach this problem .now i live in tokyo with my grand mother .her name is kazuko .she is 68 years old .usually over 60 are rentnerin and have no work .but she is still worker .she works in drug store .every day she gets up early and leaves house .and she goes back to home late .i thougt that hard working is difficult for her .so i asked her`` such a hard working is difficult is nt you ?`` no , it is enjoyable !!she said .i was surprised to hear that .she continued .`` once i retired .but then i was at a loss what should i do .and i had a boring life .after that i determined i work again !!generally speaking i think a lot of people assume `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .but strictry speaking , it is nonsense .thinking `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  is neglect to older people , i think !!now i m second grade university student and major in english literature .when i was a freshman , i majored in gerrman literature .it was boring for me.so theni did nt enjoy life .but i decided changing my major and could achieve this desire .so now i am enjoying my daily life !!conclusion states that `` enjoying life  does nt matter age !!thank you !!that s all !!
