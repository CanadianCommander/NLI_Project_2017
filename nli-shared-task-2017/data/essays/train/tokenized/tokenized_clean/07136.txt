basicly , i do strongly agree woth the idea tha successful people would like to try some new things compare with doing somethings that thay already know how to run it .i support this with the following reasons .as we know , new we faced a new time that millions of people suvive in this world .the compete increases every day .if we just following other s step , we could not success .an example could give some light to this point .bill gate , who is growing from a poor boy to the richest person in the world , gave up his undergraduate study when he is a junior and then donate himself to his own caree .just think about that what if he didnot have this decition ?we may have a good professor or a good researcher , but not today s bill .secondly , this is a idom that  no pay , on gain  .this is just tell you a truth that you can not success without any payment .it is real that someone can gain a good lives by chance , but in most condition , try new thing and take risks mean you have more chances than other person .last , but not least , under some circumstances , some people do have some good result by doing some mormal things before .however , in this special environment currently , most people spend their lives in the same mode : go to school , graduate , get a not bad job and finally get married .how can you distinct from others ?just use your special thought .for instance , you think about thing in a totally new way , you may get more advantages to success .so , based on the above disscusion , we summurize a conclusion that the success always like to come to those people who like chanllage theirselves and dare to take risks for their caree .
