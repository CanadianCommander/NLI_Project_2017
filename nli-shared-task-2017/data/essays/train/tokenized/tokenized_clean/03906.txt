i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .examples from academic theories , successful enterprises and real life proove the validity of that statement .for instance , on stock markets there is a rule that states that it is more likely to get more return when accepting more risk .whereas if you invest your money in a secure option , your yield will be fairly less .this theory of the positive correlation of risk and return can be easily transferred to successful business models .amazon .com , for instance , is a good example of a successful company .the founders of amazon .com took a great risk in investing their money in this project .the idea of selling books online was completely new and no one knew if this business model would succeed .another successful entrepreneur is bill gates .creating microsoft was very risky , because the use of personal computers was still new at that time and bill gates could not be sure about the selling success of his programms .trying new things and taking risks in everyday life , will increase one persons  ability to react to unexpected situations .it will thus reinforce one persons  self-esteem and self-conciousness , which are important characteristics in todays society .a person will more easily succeed in its personal life since that person will be able to face and resolve problems with less fear .in my opinion , all these examples proove that trying new things and taking risks contributes possitively to success .
