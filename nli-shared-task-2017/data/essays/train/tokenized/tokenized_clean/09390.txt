i heared about syria is a beautiful country .i went there with friends two years ago .it was one of my worest travel trip , we were a group of four and we satied there for one week and we did nt know where to go .because we did nt know about the place and we did nt a tour guide , the trip was boring instead of funy .after one year , i went there again with the tour guide and the trip was totally oppiset .i had fun and i saw the beautiful places .therefore , i think in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel because you can schedule your time and many visit good places .basicly , time is very important factor during your travel because you do not have enough time and the time go quickly .when you travel to other places , you do not usually have a time to visit every thing there .in this case , the tour guide can help the group by manage their times and this person will set a clear plan for the group to wrk on .since you are in vication , you have to fell the pleasure of being in vication withou forgeting that the time is going quickly .beside the time management , the tour guide can show you more places by providing you more options and direction .althoughthere will be more places to go and visit , the tour guide will offer you the best places .in addition , he or she can give you more advice where to go .on the other hand the tour guide is going to save you from lost because you know the places and how to get there .in conclustion , if you want your trip time to be managed properly and also visit more places , the only way is to have a tour guide in your group .you have to remeber that you are in vication and you need to save every moment for f
