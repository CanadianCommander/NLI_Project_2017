i agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well .successful people always try new things because they can see the long view in their eyes .why they will want to try the new things ?this question is similiar as why people will creat new things which old people never imaging befor .it is because people all need to grow up .how can we grow up ?if we always do some thing we alreafy know how to do well , can we grow up ?it is nt said do the old thing is not good at all , we need to do that but succeessful people will do that when they take risks .so what will succeessful people do ?succeessful people will try some difficult things they never do .maybe they will fall down but they can learn a lot form ther fall down .for example , a man always play foodball in high school , he was the team s leader and many college invide him to go to their school to play foodball .he go to one of those college and he have long vacation during this time .what should he do ?play foodball again and again ?no , he use this time to study by himself .he know he can not play foodball forever so when he have time he work hard to study .in the end of story , he transfur to another famous college to study commurce .is he a succeessfull person ?he make coise to study when he is free because he see the long tern in his futhure .people always do some things their already know because they are afraid .they afraid their will do wrong things .succeeful people will take risks because they believe even they fall down they still can learn a lot that help them succeed .
