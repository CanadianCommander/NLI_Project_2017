i agree with the idea that success is mostly acheived when people venture into new terrotories and explore things that they may not know so well .usually trying new things or venturing into uncharted territory results in outcomes that can be extremely good or bad for an indiviudual .when pharmaceutical companies invest in new drugs , or inventions they are well aware that they might lose the money that they have invested .however , they are also aware of the fact that the risks have to be taken by someone in order for success to happen .people who take risks often try new things whilst being aware of and for the most part having experienced great losses .however , what makes a person succeed is the ability of this person to handle the new and risky .without the risks that many took in science and in experimentation , many of the simple diseases known to us now would be fatal .if people stuck to what they knew and everyone contiued doing the same thing .then the world would be a stagnant place where not much will change .people who take risks and change what it is that is known to them allow new areas to be explored , therefore , becoming experts in things that were previously new .we currently live an evolving world , where new discoveries and inventions are made on a daily basis .in order for a person to live in this world they have to prove their ability to contribute to it .in many ecomonies jobs are scarce and people struggle to feed themselves and their families .people who want to be outstanding or who want to deliver more to this world find themselves having to think outside of the box , and assume more personal risk .success may vary for each individual .what remains the same is the fact that in order to excel in something a person has to expand of that which is known to him or her .expansion can not be achieved if people limited themselves to what they felt they new .it is when one tries something new that they might realize new abilities and strengths within themselves .
