the more technology develop , the more people are required to have a lot of work to do .of course , the fact that young people do not want to give time to help their communities is a bad happening .however , if they already get streessed out by overloading work , how can they care about their communities .first , most high school students living in korea should stay in their schools for almost all days .they have a lot of strees to have to enter the good university like seoul national university .they are forced to study hard in a school .actually , the forcing that they should study hard and hard is decreasing lately .but there are still many students who are forced to study in their schools from eighty am to ten pm .if they spend most time which they can have in a day on studying , i doubt that they can help their communities or poor people , even if they are truely interested in it or want it .moreover , there is another serious problem .most parents and most atmosphere in societies have been instructing young people as selfish ways .they say that helping other people or communites is useless because that can benefit them .most people estimate a stuff what byproducts it can make , especially money .people think that if some event can make a lot of money , it is definitely worth to consider .but if that can not make money , for example helping poor people , free service for disable people , and aiding senior people , most people tell their children that they do not have to spend their time on it because it will not help thier ability or career .if their children concentrate on it , their parents think their children may not keep up with other students and then they will be defeated in competitions .looser means people who failed in their life .to conclude , it is not that young people do not want to spend their time on helping communites , maybe it is just that their parents and the society do not want them to spend on it .
