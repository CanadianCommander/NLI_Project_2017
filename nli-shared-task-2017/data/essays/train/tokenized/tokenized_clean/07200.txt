althougth i woud like that it is not true , i am agree with this statement , because it is that happens nowadays .in fact , the majority of young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , because they are not enough interested of their communities , and of the probelms of them .i think that the people of the generation before this have not the same behaviour , and i do not know why now that happens .i supposed that the parents has not learnt to their son the importance of helping their communities .therefore , many young people are interested only of their problems , maybe very little problems , and of their , probably , few friends .they do not consider the community s problem , and the problem of each member of the community .therefore they do not keep part in solving that , he do not give their precious contribute .
