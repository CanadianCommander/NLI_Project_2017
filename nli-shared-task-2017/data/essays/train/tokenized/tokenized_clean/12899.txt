in my point of view , i agree with that most advertisings or commercial messeges make products look much better than they really are .there are three reasons of my opinion .first , all of company advertise their product to sell as much as they can , so they try to show their product much better than they really are .they even spend their cost for advertising tremendously , and in these days , many of companies consider how to make the best advertisements or commercial messege and hire some specialists for that .for instance , one of the big companies in country , toyota usually estimates its cost for advertising approximately 20 ~ 30 % of their budget annualy .i assume that others also spend the budget for that .second , the companies usually try to make their image better and advertising is the primary stragedy for that .in my country , images of companies , industries , and productions depend on what sort of advertisement and commercial messege they do and how they make the consumers impress about them .in my country , about 10 years ago a small venture company got bankruptsy because of the commercial messege and it was brought to the court .the judge ruled that the image was part of sexial harrassment .i think this is rare example , but that is the advertising .finally , the advertising companies are also doing their business .in my country , i think it is the same as in the united states , the competition between the advertising companies are also hard and they try to make the best commercial they can .so , their motivation is also very high .in asia , there is a big competition of commercial messege and they decide the best commercial in every year .in conclusion , i can not say this is good because we are confused because of the advertisement and we just buy something , even if it is not good .all we should do is just look anything carefully when we buy something .
