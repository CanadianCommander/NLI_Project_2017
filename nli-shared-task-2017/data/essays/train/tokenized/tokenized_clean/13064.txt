i do agree with the statements .we need to start from ideas to draw our own personal conclusions .i believe our mothers are our best examples , they tought us not facts but ideals , values , good purposes to that in our life we can use what we learned and apply them into actions and facts .and we understood them as concept at firsta nd we applied them in our life seeing each day results .the importance of facts in the process of learning it if of course crucial .a fact that happens , especially if unexpected , can be a ` short cut  to understan what thet idea or what the concept it is and how it is hidden behind it .in general , i think the two parts are very much linked almost two halfs , infact i think that the first is very often the conceguence of the second .thus we can not split them nor we should invert them .to understand the power of a concept we need to see the facts that this idea produces as well as seeing a fact will make sense completely only when we can deduce the concept that sustained it ; by doing it i believe that what we learn will be stored in us as a complete information cause-effect and we will be able to recall it when a similar need will emerge in our lives .that is the reason of why we study , eventualy to prepare us to the real world and to give us the capacity to overcoming problems and help us solving situations .we can learn the trueness of this sentence considering as well how could i understand if a concept or an idea that by definition it is thoretical will answer me the same way
