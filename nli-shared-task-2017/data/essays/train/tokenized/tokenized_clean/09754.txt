the best and most popular mode of trivelling today is a car .you can reach any where at your own time schedule with the help of a car .it does overcome some of the disadvantages of other systems such as bus , train etc .to trivel by train or bus we have to go by their schedule , and they can be used to reach only specific locations .but the future is not so good for the cars .i agree with the statement that twenty years from now thier will be ferwer cars than today .cars require fuel to run .today the fuel used is mainly petroleium or natural gas in the form of lpg or cng .these are fossile fuels and they are non renewable , so they will tend to decrease over the time .the supply of these fuels will decrease over the time .so they will become more expensive to afford by normal people .as a result number of car owners will decrease .cars make lot of polution which is responsible for various health and environment related problems such as global worming or lung cancer .the problems related to the cars are all related to the fuel they are using .so if we can get the alternate energy souce to run a car then it may have the bright future and we can see more cars than ever in next 20 years .the alternative energy souce for this fossile fuels is solar energy , or fuel cells , which use hydrogen as their fuel .the problem with use of fuel cells is that it requires carring hidrogen along with the car .hidrogen is very explosive if it is exposed to atmosphere , so carring hidrogen along with the car is like sitting on a bomb .as far as other option goes , there are very few cars which run on solar energy today , this is mainly because these cars are expensive .but as the technology grows these cars may be affordable and can be available for use for resonable price .the other point that we should note that world is going towards globalization .it means increase in the competition .so people will require faster routes to trivel .todays cars are limited in speed not only due to the car itself but due to over crowding of cars , remember the time we spent in trafic .so in order to promote the car in future one need to see to these issues as well .answering all these questions will shape the future of cars .so twenty years from now , if we see cars in musiums or on roads in day today life will depend on all these issues .
