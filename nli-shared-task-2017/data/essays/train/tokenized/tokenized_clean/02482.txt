i agree this statement , `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i ve been going to school for 12 years .i am a high school student .i learn many things at school .my favorite class is english class which i think is the most important subject we have to learn .in english class , we read some books and discuss what the book tells us .when we discuss about the books , everybody has different opinion and it is stimulating to know what other people say and figure out what the author is trying to say .there are too many messages in books for a person to understand by oneself .i think we need to discuss with many people who are smarter and have different ideas .the books do nt tell us facts .they tell us ideas and concepts .that s why we need to get together and find those ideas and concepts .those ideas and concepts are only clear to the author who writes the book .the author tries to tell other people his ideas and concepts by writing books , but it is impossible for him to perfectly tell them .this is the reason we keep studying ideas and concepts , and i think it is important for us to understand them .i think ideas and concepts are more important than facts .facts are like the things we learn in physics , chemistry or math .we need to know all those facts to be investors or some scientists , but i do nt think learning facts is the main purpose of education .i always have a special feeling for being a human , because we can not only know the facts , but also creats ideas and concepts .other animals can not do that .i think to understand ideas and concepts make us more cultivated and better in many ways .facts let us know what is going in the world we see , and ideas and concepts let us know what is going on in our mind .i think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts because they have deeper meanings and they will make us better people .i believe that s we have to do throughout
