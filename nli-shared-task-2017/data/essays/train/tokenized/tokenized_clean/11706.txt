i agree with the statement that , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is them to learn facts .for example , in science lab it is more important to understand ideas and concepts so that there after we can learn that facts to do the experiments with the concepts that we understand .in any field , the above sentence matches .suppose in games like cricket we must first undersdtand the ideas and concepts in the game including foot work , line and length , only after understanding thoroughly the concepts of cricket we can learn facts i.e. we can practice .and also in the field of engineering , it is more important that the student understand the concept first and than to apply the concept he learned to learn facts about the experiment .in the field of design also we have to first understand the concepts behind that design and ideas behind that design and there after we can design a particular object .for example , take the design of a car .first the designer will understand the specifications and concepts behind the design af the car and there after he put on the ideas how to design a new car .so , for most of the areas it is important that we have to understand the ideas and then to learn facts .without learning ideas and details we can not know the facts about the product or a system .so , it is important for us to understand ideas and concepts to learn facts .for example , if a new theory is proposed by a scientist , it is more important for us to understand the idea behind that principle and concept of the principle and thereafter we canable to learn facts about that principle .all above examples will give information that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts , so by using the ideas and concepts we have learnt will help to understand to learn facts about a particular thing or an experiment .
