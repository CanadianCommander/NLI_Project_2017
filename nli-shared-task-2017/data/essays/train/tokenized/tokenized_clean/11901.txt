i agree with the statement which says that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .although there are some legal rules for advertisements to prevent it from being advertized with wrong information , there still are some problems .for example , when you were to do online shopping , you can easily find some products which are advertized completely different from they actually are .once i bought a necklace online from a store in other country and when i received it , i was very surprised how different it was from what i thought from the website advertisement .i am sure that many other people must have experienced this kind of situation .i think this online shopping example clearly shows that many products are overly advertised to seem much better than actual product .when you do the online shopping , all you depend on is their advertisement and maybe its picture .sometimes pictures show only the good angle of the product which attracts buyers .even the advertisement on tv have the same problem sometimes .tv advertisements for food products are one of the example .usually , when they advertise about their food products , they would not say the food does not taste good or they are ok to eat .they always have to show that the food product tastes very good .you see a advertisement of a food product and you expect it to taste good from the impression of the tv commercial but sometimes when you actually eat the food product , you think  it does not taste as good as i thought !!.i think it shows the fact that those advertisement on tv makes the products seem much better than they are often times .it would not be an advertisement if it makes you an impression that the product is not good , but i think that they should at least not let the buyers to surprise a lot .they should either produce better products or not to advertise them at all .
