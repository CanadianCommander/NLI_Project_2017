in my opinion , i agree with this statement because i believe that understanding the whole context of an specific topic , in other words , capturing the ideas and concepts , would allow a student to develop a better meaning of what he is learning which could be reinforce with the different facts described during the course .for example , when i was a attending classes at university , i always tried to pay more attention to the main ideas the professor was trying to explain , which does not mean that i found facts less important , but in my case , i knew that in order to understand and facilitate my studying for an exam , it would better if i could develop the topic thinking in a different way and not just memorizing each word he said or each fact stated .nevertheless , facts would help me have more specific details about the class but if i have just learned facts or be more interested in them than in concepts probably i would forget those facts faster and may have more problems in answering questions that were not asked during the class because i did not understand what the main idea was about or what the professor was trying to teach us .another important example why i am convinced ideas and concepts worth more than facts is related with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is being developed .for instance , most students have a knowledge on how a country s economy works or why it is important to have accountants in a company without needing to study economics or finance just by understanding the concept of free markets and how important finance are for companies to succeed .students are going to have a better knowledge of what they are learning if teachers put mpre emphasis on the ideas and concepts rather than facts .
