ideas and factsi desagree with the statement , because the facts are important as the ideas and concepts , the are connect because the ideas and concepts give the students the facts , they are always behind , in any explication and understanding of ideas and concepts , we have to consider the facts , to have a deeper reasoning about what we want to learn , but why some people not consider facts as important ?many people think that the concept or meaning is the only thing that matters , because they are superficial and do nt look behind to see the facts .for example , in a high school , the students are only interest in learning the concept as it is , not to know what cause it , or why it is there , this lack of interest on going deeper on the information they have , led them to not be well prepare to present some knowlege tests , but also the teachers do nt pay attention to this lackness in their students , so the students only understant the ideas but not learn the facts that remarks that idea .it is important to always have some facts , so that we can make a better analizis to the theory , that involves the ideas and the concepts , analyzing all the things we have in our head , to make a better job .this doesnt mean that the ideas and the concepts are not important , thay are very important because with them is that we can take in account the facts , so undestanding ideas and concepts are very , very important , to have a clear thought of what we have .this is like when a bird born , at the begining it is only interest or focus on the food the mother give him , but later needs to know the facts that involves how the mother obtains the food , how she procceses it , and how he can do that .are things that maybe at the beginig it doesnt put attention but at the end would be very an important thing to him .can be concluded , that the facts , and the ideas and concepts , are both very important to have a better knowlege about something , that when we see the concept , we also have to consider the facts that are behind .
