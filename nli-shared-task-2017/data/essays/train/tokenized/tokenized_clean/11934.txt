young people and their communitiesyoung people have the ability and the time to do many things for their communities but nowadays they are busy in other things like playing games , watching tv , spending too much time with friends .i agree with that statement because of the following reasons : they think that the othe things ( playing , watching tv , ...ets ) more important than helping their communities ; and they think that the young people themselves need help from their communitis .many young people are interested in the computers and video games , internet , wathing tv and movies , and visiting friend and spend much time with them .so they are very busy with these things and they ca nt find time to help their communities .also the young people think that they themselves need their communities help by giving them advise by the older people about studying in universies and how they can choose a good univerdity and a good major .also they want to learn from the experts .those experts are usually from the old people .moreover , we have to give the young people a feeling that they are men we can depend on them .and if they feel that , they may provide help to their communities .for ecxample , if you deal with ayoung person as a chile he will hate you and the community and wo nt help you .for these reasons i think that young people do nt give enough time to help their communities .but if we provide advise for those young people they will help their communities but when they get older .
