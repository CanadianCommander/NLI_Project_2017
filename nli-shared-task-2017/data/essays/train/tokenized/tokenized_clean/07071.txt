in order to be a successful person many people have acomplished it by trying new ideas and taking risks .doing what you you already know to do will not take no anywhere if it is what most of the people do .many of the best inventions on the world were the outcome of risks taken by common people , just like you and me .we should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new projects .a short example to help me prove my point is the following : there is a man that has been doing the same work over and over again , his life dosent change .he is good at what he does but just like him , many others are good as him .if this man would try out new things of change some of the things he does in his normal rutine and find a way to be more efficiently , he could change his life .he is the only person who can actually do this .taking risks is good to do once in a while .business men are known to be risk takers .in a business , many decision have to be made .once simple decision can make a difference on the final outcome .some times you might have taken a risk that you didnt want , but it happens to be a sucess .we should also learn from our mistakes in order to not make them again .also everyday we make simple decision with out even realizing it .these decision can be things just like what you will wear that day or what you will eat .for example , going to a restaurant and asking the waiter for a different plate of food which is not the one you normally would order .sometimes , your risk may not have been a success , but you may not loose anything .as an old man once said , `` you loose 100 % of the shots you do not take .
