learning and understanding are two cognitive abilities that are closely related and are part of the every day experience of a human being .i would say that , since students are constantly interacting with their environment and with others , learning from these experiences come as the main factor .this ability could be defined as the disposition of the student to process information he receives from his environment , through his senses ( what he sees , listens and feels ) and is capable to categorize and keep this information for adaptional purposes .each information is contained in what we commonly call : experiences .and by experiences i mean facts .facts are part of reality , part of the outside world , and helps a student understand a world that should be articulated with his internal experiences ( such as thoughts , and emotions ) .moreover , become socially adaptive and in coherence with his own thoughts about how the world works and how will he explain to himself the actions and reactions of his enviroment ; including natural scenarios , people and the diversity of this interactions , which are all part of the process of learning .understanding becomes an ability where the student considers what of all that he has learned is comprehensible enough for him .that is , if he distinguishes significantlly between events and parts of reality .for example , a new subject ( chemistry , to mention one ) is being taught to a student , first he receives all the information about it , theories , authors , investigations , etc ; but right after he has , lets say , accumulate all this information in his mind , after he has learned about this new subject , he will begin to comprehend , understand it , by re-reading books , articles , by talking and expressing his ideas , by reproducing the author s point of view , etc .therefore , i do nt agree with the statement .i consider that facing the oustide world is first and it is a process of learning ; understanding is that second part of the process on where the student ( or human being ) will form in his mind ideas , concepts , opinions , even hypothesis about what he has already learned .so learning and understanding are in the same level of importance .it is a matter of what comes first and how they influence the interaction between the student s innerworld and reality placed outside .
