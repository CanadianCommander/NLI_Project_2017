although peole may think that there will be more cars in the world as the years go by , i hold a different view .i strongly believe in 20 years , there will be fewer cars in use due increasingly high-maintance costs and better alternatives .first of all , i hold this opinion because i believe that the increasingly high - maintance cost of cars will discourage people to drive cars .during the past few years the oil prices have increased more than two-fold , which is making it difficult and unreasonable to keep up with automobile maintance expenses .although , having the luxury of driving and owning your car may seem more glamorous , it just istn practicable nor reasonable anymore .as such more and more people are being discouraged to use cars .in addition , i believe that there will be fewer cars 20 years from now due to the fact that people now have better alternatives for transportation .30 years ago , using a car was essential , as a means of transportaion .if you needed to go on a business trip or visit family , there was not much alternative methods .however , nowadays , a car is nt the only method of going somewhere , there are various alternatives .in places like new york or hong kong , you really do nt need a car to move around , you can use the subway or buses as your main means of transportaiton .these days , in the major cities of the world , i believe rather than owning and driving your own car , it is more wiser to use public transportaion .in summation , due to surging oil prices and reasonable alternatives , i would have to diagree with the statement .though driving your car , whether it is on a date or to work may have many benefits , i do not believe those benifits will out weigh the rational of choosing a different means of transportation .
