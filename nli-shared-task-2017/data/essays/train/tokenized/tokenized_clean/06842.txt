i agree with the statement and there are many examples to support this idea .nowadays young people do not help their communities at all and inside the changes of society and culture can be found the answer of this behavior .in my personal opinion , i think that the reasons for which young people do not help their communities are three .first of all , it has become very common to live in cities which are not very small in size .living in a big city means that a young boy or girl do not have the usual places that there were in the past .during the last decades , the church , for example , was the typical place where young people could help the others , for instance , they helped old people or the little community near the church .secondly , in the past it was usual to live in little houses and your neighbors became your friends and all this friendships formed a community in which everyone gave their help for the others , everyone did something to the overall benefit .this was a great advantage because young people , living in this particular atmosphere , could see their work appreciated in the community which transformed itself in a big family .today this kind of situation is not possible because people usually live in a block of flats and everyone thinks only about his | her own bussiness , nobody thinks how can be important to have the possibility to have the help of the community .thirdly , today society and culture has changed very much and , of course , young people are changed too .every young boy or girl live in a world without the others , it menas that young people prefer to stay alone .nowadays young people thinks only about themselves , for example , about not intelligent things such as their games , their shoes or bags .they are only concerned on them and not on other people and in particular on community .in conclusion , all these three reasons can not explain this phenomenon in all its features , but can make easier to understand why young people are so far with their hearts from one of the most important thing inside the society : the community .
