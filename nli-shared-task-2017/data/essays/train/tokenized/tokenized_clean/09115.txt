i am agreeing with the topic that in twety years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now today , why because for better convenience , due to less cost , to show status purpose , and needs of the humans .day by day the technology is growing and also at the same people also improved technologcally and these people preferring to live better convenience , those convienients are protection from rain and sunlight etc. , and also people can travel longer distances with out suffering than that of other vehicles like two wheelers and three wheellers .secondly the costs also shows some reflection on the usage than that of past 20 years back .at that time people may not be able to put that much money why because at that time he resourses not available properly .the old people thinks about money not for what they are using for travelling .day by day cars becoming cheaper and people willing to purchase the car .thirdly status purpose .some people think that if one have a car he belongs to some higher range , not only status purpose but also for build-up .finally earinings of the people incereasing day by day at the same time living cost of the people also increasing .if some budy earns more than $ 2000 he must have acar in this tren people changed like that .people thinking that there is no need of saving money for future , what they have they have to enjoy now it self .thats why the number of cars increased than than of past twenty years back .in conclusion definately the number of cars increased due to some of above reasons .the main reason is accorind to the technology the people modernizing them self , owning the car is also one of the modernization .so the numer of cars more than what we have twenty years back .what ever it mat be the usage of cars incresed in these twenty years .
