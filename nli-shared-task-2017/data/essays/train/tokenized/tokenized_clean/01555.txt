i agree with this that .it is really important for students to unbderstand ideas and concepts .it is more difficult thing than learn facts .first , they can learn facts anytime , if they wish .but how about the ideas or concepts ?the answer is it wo nt .because to understand ideas and concepts are nt on the text or online .even the teacher wo nt teach about that .and i think the most of the kids does nt know which of these .do you know why ?the most oof the parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them .but i think it s wrong .if we get the facts and concepts , the children can understand the really really basic part of the things .and that makes children interests .second , the facts and concepts are more specific thing .every adults thinks , they are difficult for children so the children do nt have to know about that .that is not true .the truth is the adults do nt know about the facts and concepts .that s why they saying about that .they do nt know so the children does nt have to know .i think that s kind of stupid .and the adults scare about the kids will learn that something they do nt know .i think it is very good thing to know about the facts and concepts .i know it s hard , but if you learn that your world will be change .do nt you think that s more interesting thing than ljust learning from the text ?i think yes .so iwant to kids to know about the facts and conceots .then they will interest about the lots of things .if all kids interest in facts and concepts the world will be change more interesting thing ever .so , if they learn and know about tfacts and concepts they will theach their s future kids .and the world will change .i hope that world will be come as soon .
