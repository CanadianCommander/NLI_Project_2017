the beauty of flower is time .and so , if we as a community do not use our time appropriately , we will dramatically suffer , especially young people .the major problem arises today and it is that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to help in contributing their communities .unfortunately , they spend much of their time on futile and fruitless things , such as watching television for hours , surfing on restricted sites on the internet , and spending less time on reading beneficial and andvantageous stuff .unquestionably , most dwellings today contain at least one television set .the problem is that young people do not benefit from televisions nowadays , where instead of watching useful stuff , such as ` the discovery chanel  or ` animal planet  , they tend to watch things that are noxious and ` brain washers  .without a doubt televesions today are considered ` like a white elephant  .young people nowadays need to contribute harder and use the internet more efficiently .i am sure that there are abundance amount of people in this world use internet unwisely by watching porn and bad things on the internet .my point here is that the internet is a colossal source of information and many young people look at it on the decietful way , which is really depressing and exasperating .i strongly agree that much time should be spent on reading rather that watching television .and that is because reading makes the person more productice by giving him crucial and pivotal information about many things in life .moreover , reading is exceedingly useful for the brain , as it makes it more active and vivacious .in the long run , i strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .and neccessary action should be taken for the whole community to make an end to this unwanted crisis .
