in our modern societies , we more frequently come across zoung people laughing and entertaining than older people .does it really convey the idea that young people enjoy life more than people do ?i believe that with maturity comes experience and a tremendous knowledge which helps individuals navigate their life more easily and have more time for fun and entertainment .we will see how the periods of life , the personality of each of us and our aims drive our enjoyment of life .it is a matter of fact that different periods of life offer different opportunities for enjoyment .a younger person will believe he has his whole life in front of him .naturally he will feel less concerned about his future and long-term objectives .usually younger persons have a better health and feel invicible like if they would never die .taking all these concerns away is probalbly the reason why people who just came of age give the impression of enjoying very much their life .going through studies , youngers are for the first time facing their first fundamental questions : what do they want to do in their life ?older people have already gone through these fundamental questions and have their life accomplished , giving them more opportunities to relax and enjoy life .of course , given the fact that each of us is unique , we indeed have different personalities .personally i am an anxious person who always think about my future and the next steps in my life .for this reason i sometime have the impression to enjoy less my life when i should like many other have a more cursory attitude towards life .older people when they reach the third age are concerned about how people will remember them and what they have accomplished in their life .although we all experience stress and difficulties at different period of our life , it is important to see the positive aspects of life and benefit from the experience we build throuhout our life .therefore i believe there is no specific age for enjoying more life .what is important is to keep an open and positive attitude whatever difficulty we go through .
