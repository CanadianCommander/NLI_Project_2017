the world is big and there are lots of things that we are not aware of what happens around .most of us go to the collages and try to be best in our depatments and graduate with the high marks .but i thing we miss someting when we really focus an what we are doing .i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of working on a specific one .i am a biologist .i have graduated from the universtiy 3 months ago .i am very hard-working and ambitious student .i always wanted to be best and get high marks from the exams .i think i achieved this .but sometimes i think that whether it was good or not to be ambitions like me .when i look those days i thing that i wish i was not so ambitions .i could have thougt that there were many things in the world more then exams and schol .life is not worth living wihout noticing events that happen around you and also what was happened in the past .why i say this ?past .one of my hobby is reading about history .i would really concerned about how people were living in the past .their cultures , customs , behaviors to each other and differenced between generations .because i belive that this is a chain .what we do today will be related to the past .those are our ancestor and we are the hiers .every one should know something about their country  s history .i realized that time it is never to late to do something .i hope i will attend my education in biology because it was my dream .i will continue to my researches in one of the tecnical university in my country about the medical plants ana tissue cultures .and i hope to go abroad with my researches .but this time i will not adopt myself only my workings .i will create time to read much more about the news around world , politics , also art and history .i will educate myself every kind of subject .
