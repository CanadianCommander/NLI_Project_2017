traveling in a group led by a tour guide could be a great alternative especially of you have never been in a place before .taking a tour guide could take you to the most exciting places and also you could learn about the history of it .however there is another option that you have if you want to travel , which is travelling by your own .traveling by your own is a challenging experince where someone is taking a risk .in spite of , he is his own guide , so he could go wherever he wants , in any time of the day .imagen that i am traveling to a country that i have seldom heard about it , but i did not want a tour guide .this means that i could get loose , specially if i do not know where i am going throw .nevertheless , i can get some information about this place before i go , investigate the most exciting places and things that it could do and selected it according my own likes .on th other hand , tour guides usually takes you to memorial places related to the history of it , which some people found it boring .instead they would prefer to visit beaches , cities , taste traditional dishes , etc .this could be done if you travel by your own , without the feeling that you had payed for something you did not enjoyed and that you are wasting money on it .finally , when you travel by your own you can spend as much time as you want in one place than in other .case that is not posible in a tour group because each visit is specifilly measured so that you have to adjust your time as the schedule thay have plan .travelling
