the number of cars appering on traffic is groving rapidly everyday .some people argue that in a near future there will be way too much cars than the roads and cities can support .however this is not the only idea on the issue .some people has firm beliefs that in two decades , the number of cars will reduce .i agree with this statement .first , the way of living for the most people is changing substatially .it is now possible for much more people to work at home with the improvements in technology and the internet .the need for going to offices everyday between certain hours is fading away .also , the energy supplies that are needed to run conventional automobiles are getting lesser everyday , unless a new energy source will be found , which will also have to be very cheap , driving a car will become much more expensive than today .the rises in the petrol prices is daily news nowadays .another point to mention is the negative effects of cars to the environment .the public is getting more concerned everyday to the environment issue , and their sensitivity reflect to their lifestyles .most people start preferring alternative transportations such as subways , trains , or even bycycles .furthermore , it will not be fortune telling to predict that the governments will take actions in order to discourage people from using cars .the negative effects of growing number of cars on traffic has serious impacts on economy .even today , the structures of the cities are not capable of supporting so many cars and some measures to reduce the number of cars , are in public opinion .in conclusion , there are much more supporting reasons to predict that the demand for cars will reduce .the ground for such an arguement can be based on economic , social and technological needs and requirements .there is no reason for not to believe that the number of the cars will be fewer than they are today .
