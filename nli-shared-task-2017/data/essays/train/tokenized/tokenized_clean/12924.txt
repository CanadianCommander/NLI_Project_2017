there could be several benefits of the travel led by a tour guide : travel more efficientlly , communicate better than individual travelling , not wasting times , and could be much cheaper and easier to explore new world .but if one , who thinks the experience is most important than just sight seeing like me , will disagree though all the benefits i mentioned .there  re much more things that individual free travel could get .first , the communications .if you travel as free travel , you can use your own language to communication with others during travels .through this , you may become to try more express your owns and it could help to improve your ablity to communicate with different culture s people .for examples , the free speaking with dwellers or short conversation with people who takes bus together .if you travel with the tour guide , you ca nt experience this kind of things .there will be translaters who is tour guide when you face the language problems .second , various kind of anectdotes can be your own memorial things .like many mistakes during the travels or conversations with diffrent people , and processes to enter , or culture shocks , many things that only you can experience , your own things .they make make you remember much more after travels about what you travels .if you go with the tour guide , it can be easily happened , because tour guide indicate from small ettiquittes to the large culture of the country you travel .you ca nt learn your own experience , and furthermore , what you learned from tour guide will be easily disappear after travels .the main purpose of the travel can be the experience of new world .with tour guide , you might also be passive to experience that , it will not give plenty of opportunity to experience that by yourself .there could be more opportunity , if you travel by your own ablities without tour guide .
