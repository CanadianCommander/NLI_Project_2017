many people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .on the contrary , i believe that many young people give a lot of time to helping their school mates , families , and other citizens .my reasonning here is built on the two following arguments .first , i think that many people just does not see the young people s help to their communities .i will give two very relevant examples from my own experience to support this idea .i spent my summer vacation in california , volunteering in the  trail maintenance crew  at redwood national park .during the two months i spent over there , i met dozens of young volunteers , but i met only one volunteer over the age of thirty .thus , many young people are volunteering for free worldwide in national parks and forests , but only very few people realize how much time these young people gave to help preserving the world s natural ressources .another relevant example are beach lifeguards .many people lie and rest on the beach without thinking about those young lifeguards .these young people spend their day watching for endangered swimmers , and sometimes risk their own life to rescue them .then , i think many people still focus on the damages that young people can cause .i will again use an example from my own experience to illustrate the fact that young people who feel responsible of the well being of their communities still exist .for instance , there an association in my school , whose members clean the facilities and repair broken items after parties .thus , i think that many young people continue to give their time worldwide .
