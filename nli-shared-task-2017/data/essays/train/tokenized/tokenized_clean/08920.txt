in my opinion , a choice between understanding ideas and concepts , instead of learning facts , can not be made .both clearly appear to me to be important , for different reasons .understanding of ideas and concepts is the final purpose of the study , and it is what students will retain for all their lives , even if they would have forgotten facts .knowledge about main political ideas , or major historical processes , will always help them to understand the world they are living in , even if they could have forgotten what happened in paris on july 4 in 1989 .knowing all details and dates of french revolution is not helpful in itself .but on the other hand , without facts , ideas and concepts are only empty boxes .one could not understand where they come from .e. g. in the case of french revolution , it would be difficult to recognize contemporary french patriotism s roots in the country s modern history .moreover , connecting concepts to reality is very helpful in memorizing .students can be best helped in learning if a complete frame is provided them .the best way to teach could be to present students with facts , and then stimulate them to draw their own conclusions .anyway , it must also be noticed that the weight of these two skills - understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts - is different according to the matter or subject of study .for example , in a physics course , the most important thing is learn physic s laws .in this case , understanding concepts would be more useful for students than knowing how scientists formulated a certain theory .on the contrary , without a strong knowledge of facts , many theories of anthropology could not be fully understood .finally , what is the priority , must be evaluated differently case by case .
