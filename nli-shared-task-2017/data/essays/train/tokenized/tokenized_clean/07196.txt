some people think that it s better to have a broad knowledge of many and different academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .both the opinions present several strengthens and weakenesses but i d rather agree with the former position .first of all , i think that broad knowledge is really important in the modern world .in the business world for example , you have to be able to talk both about business and about products .to talk about the former you have to know something about economics ; but if you have to talk about the latter you should probably know something about sociology and customer satisfaction .that s what i thought when i had to decide what to do after the high school .on that occasion i decided to study engineering and among the different majors i chose civil engineering because it did nt provide me with too much specialization .second , i also think that it s very difficult to decide which particular subject to focus on .in this sense , it s much better to study and cover many academic subjects in order to be flexible .in fact , flexibility makes you able to focus on different issues and on different subjects during your life .that s what has happened to me .i am an engineer but i actually work for a famous economic consulting firm .everyday life asks me to focus on different problems in different fields and that s why i say that flexibility is an important value .in that sense , having a broad knoledge of different subjects can help you to keep your mind open .considering all the things stated above , i think that specialization does nt consider the social evolutions of the modern era .in fact , in today s world , people must cover different fields in order to reach success .
