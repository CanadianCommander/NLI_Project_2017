as the dictum says : `` hard work works  .it is hard to become a succesful person , but there is nothing easier than losing what we have been working for .the goal of each person is to succeed .but there is no limitation to success .as an example , a rich person will always try to get richer .according to the old philosophies , the human nature is based on desires .a man or a woman is always in search of new things that will allow him to develop his or her experience .no one of us is free because we are all conditionated by our perpetual desires .the satisfaction of a desire systematically caused a new desir .the philosophy calls this `` the hegemony s human nature  .`` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .let s take the example of alexandre the great who was dominating all the mediteranean area .because of his desire of hegemomism , he wanted to mater the whole world and that led him the the loss of his empire .let s point out more concrete examples : in the capitalist world , a company will always try to conquer new markets ( as globalization ask for ) rather concentrating on his own market . ..this can cause the company s failure .as far as i am concerned , i completly agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .this is the human s nature and no one can denie it .but humans are trying to decrease these risks with philosophies as the oriental philosophies by defending the next theory : `` control the desires in order to master only what we know how to do well and avoid the risk of losing what we have  .
