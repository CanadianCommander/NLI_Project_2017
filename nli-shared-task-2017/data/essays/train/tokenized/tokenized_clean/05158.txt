i like traveling and i have traveled many times in my life .from my experiences , although i understand the merits of traveling alone , i agree with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .especially i do when the visiting place is unfamiliar to me and the period is within a week .there are three reasons for that .firstly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone .when the place is unfamiliar to you , it is very dangerous and troublesome .if you traveling alone , you should take all the responsibility for what you do ; eat , walk aroud , buy tickets , get a loss , transfer .however , the tour guide can solve almost all of the problems and sometimes the member of the group also can help you .when i was traveling europe last year in a group , i caught a cold and a member of the group gave me medicine at that time .secondly , traveling in a group is cheaper than traveling alone .for example , the cost of transportation or entrance fee for museums are discounted in a group .thirdly , traveling in a group provide chances to get close each other in the group and that is a lot of fun .but i have an experience that some people quarreled and battled in a group tour which i belonged to .and i think that possible happens when the travel continues more than a week .therefore i added the premise that the travel ` within a week  .accordingly , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide especially when i visit unfamiliar place within a week .
