i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities .to be more clear , by young people i would mean people in the age group of 20-35 yrs .as times are changing , people are getting more and more involved with themselves , and the materialistic pleasures of life .this is especially true of the young generation , who value money more than anything .as a result , most of the attention of our youth is on earning money , and hence they are busy fulfilling their aim .today s world is very competitive and in this struggle , young people often do not find the time to contribute to their community .another reason for such a thing , is that communities are no longer close knit as they used to be .there is a lesser feeling of belonging to some particular community , and there is the emergence of a global community .more and more people travel to various places , and hence it is difficult for them to associate with a particular community .reasons apart lets state some examples from our experiences .one such example is the lack of participation of youth in voluntary organisations , such as those for educating the poor people .it might be true that young people contribute money in such schemes , but we dont see too many young people , actually going out there and teaching .another example is the absence of young leaders in our government .young people do not find such a career very financially rewarding and hence abstain from actively participating in the functioning of a government .so as time is progressing , young people are getting motivated to work more for themselves , than for their communities .i would not say that this is true for all young people , but it would hold true in most cases .such a drift away from community responsibility is primarily motivated by the current lifestyle of the younger generation .
