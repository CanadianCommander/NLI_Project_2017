i agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people because there are several reasons to explain this firstly older people health will not be well compared to youger people by this most often they can not go for out of stations for picnics , excertions or tours but younger people visit all the places and enjoy the beauty of atmosphere .they even learn how to survive in different weather conditions in future if they have to face .secondly , older people can not able to learn new things faster and they can not able to update their knowledge as compared to the younger people .younger people has that stability that they can change themselves from changing world .they can even give the world a new product for changing world as concerned to older people their brain doesnot work properly after certain age and they can not develop new products for the changing world as compared to younger people .another main thing about the older people is that they stick to their old taste that doesnt exist in the present life this is advantageous for the youger people that their tastes exist in the present life and they can enjoy more than older people such as movies , clubs , pubs .but in case of older people they can not enjoy the tastes of present life .younger people can participate in sports such as cricket , soccer , baseball as it is starting age for them but in case of older people it is not possible for them because their health conditions must not satisfy the requirements of the sports .in the present busy life older people are not able to survive the fastness of the current world as in case of younger people they are able to survive and their are becoming the creators of the present world .for all this reasons i agree younger people enjoy more than older people .
