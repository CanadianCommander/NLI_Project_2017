university courses nowadays are made of ideas , concepts and facts .but i disagree with the statement that says that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .concepts and ideas are only a basis , concepts and ideas are often born from facts and facts allow students to go out of the theorical field to be closer to the professional life .in university courses , concepts and ideas are only a basis .it is essential to understand them but it is also worthful to learn how tu use them through facts .facts are in a sense concrete examples or elements which will help students to learn concepts and ideas and help them understand that concepts and ideas alone are worthless if one do not learn to use them through facts .in economics sciences lots of concepts are very abstract as for instance the concept of utility .if you do not apply it to the everyday life it is stays hardly understandable .secondly most of the concepts are born from facts .sometimes ideas and concepts result from reflection but most of the time they are the result of experiences or facts .in the chemical industry a large number of formulas concerning chemical materials are born from experiences made with this same formulas and which lead to an unexpected conclusion .that is the same for cooking .lots of recipes are issued from a test .moreover facts allows students to pass through the theorical field to adapt the concepts and ideas they learn to professionnal life for example .a student learning commercial relationships will understand selling principles much better through concrete examples .actually concrete exemples or experiences related to concepts really help to be closer to the professionnal world and to understand better professional relationships .so as a conclusion one can say that concept , ideas and facts are working all together and one can even underline that in some fields like history for example , facts are most of the courses .
