i totally agree with the statement because not only i find that memorizing facts is most of the time totally useless , but i strongly believe that there is no use in learning if students can not apply the acquired information in different ways .facts such as dates , names , places , and definitions are recorded in books , encyclopedias , newspapers , and electronic documents .there is no point in spending time memorizing them , when we can have access to such data if we know how and where to find it .rather than having students memorize the meaning of a word , they should be taught how to look it up in a dictionary .instead of asking students to memorize facts in a particulary history passage , they should be presented with such information just to help them understand the background in which a historical moment took place .when students are given the opportunity to transfer the ideas and concepts that are being taught into different situations , particularly when those situations are closely related to the student s reality , the learning process `` sets in  .show them the relationship between speed , distance , and time on the blackboard , and most of them will not be able to understand it .but ask them what happens if they are late for their first class , and most of them will answer without any hesitation that they would drive faster .in my experience as a computer science teacher who teaches programming in a local high school , i d rather have my students try to figure out how to solve a particular problem by understanding what needs to be done , than letting them worry about the implementation details .this approach is not easy for them at the beginning : they want to know how all instructions in a particular language are written , and they often feel frustrated when instead of giving them the answer right away , i ask them to check the developer s documentation .once they understand that the language details are not important , because they can always go and check how a particular instruction is written or can be used , they can focus on what is truly important in computer programming : developing the skills that are needed to solve any given problem .the most rewarding comment i have had in these 12 years as a computer science teacher came from a student that is now in college studying a major in engineering .i found him this morning here , at the ibt testing center , and he said : `` ms. cannon , thank you for teaching me problem-solving .you ca nt imagine how i still use the strategies that you taught me in your class , even in subjects that do not have anything to do with engineering .
