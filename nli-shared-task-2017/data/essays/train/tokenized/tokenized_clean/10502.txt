yes , i do agree with the statement stated below .having a broad knowledge of many subjects is more good than having knowledge ioin one subject .because , every subject in the acadmic year are related with the other subject .as we know that mathematics is father of all subjects .it has the major influence on all other subjects .ther is no such subject which do not have an influence on it .having a kowledge on it only one can have the kowledge on the other subjects completely .for example , in our bachelor degree , we have the subjects mobile communications and wireless communications .each have the influence on the other .the mobile communication is the study of the science on the wireless transmissions where as the wireless transmission is the path for the mobile transmission .both have the influence on eachother .mobiles includes the telephones or the data transmission devices such as bluetooth , infrared devices which are used in the data transmission .and the wireless transmission is the study or the process involved in the data transmission .not only these both subjects , ther are many other subjects which are very closely related to each other .that is why i strongly agree with the statement that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialised in other subjects .as we know the proveb that `` knowledge is devine  .no matter what the subject is , having a knowledge on it will surely helps in kowing the other subjects .
