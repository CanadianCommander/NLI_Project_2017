i do agree with the opinion expressed in the statement .in every day life is it possible to hear statements like that .simple statements not deriving for philosophical thoughts , just simple expressions of every day life s observation .i think that is possible to explain such a cliche  giving some examples that truly confirm the point .young people have more time than adults to enjoy their life .usually young people go to school and have the opportunity to meet people of their age .sharing school-time make young people eager to play sports together , to go out at night together and enjoy life .adults usually have to think of their families , they usually work to earn the money necessary to feed their children and so they have less time to do what they want .adults actually do not have time to enjoy life .even if the adult is a rich person he has not the possibility to organize his life independently of his or her responsabilities .as you become older you have more to accomplish in order to respect what people expect from you .what i have just written could be contrasted adfirming that young people enjoy life because they do not know what life is .young people can not see the hidden difficulties that everyone experiences in his life .but we all know that sometimes is good not to know everything .i could give also a personal example , when i was ichild life seemed easy to me , i thought that could become everybody i wanted to , but now i know that real life is different .to reach want you want to reach you need to forget sometimes friends , sports , and all other things that could help enjoing life .as we all know , it is necessary for an adult person to find in his accomplishments and in his work the sources of life enjoyment .if an adult learns to understand which are the important things in his life then he or she will enjoy life .
