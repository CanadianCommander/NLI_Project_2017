depending on the cirucmstances to which the question could be posed , the answers vary accordingly .of course , young adults have completely different sources of enjoyment to middle age people who in turn , have different enjoyment to a pensioner .depending on where you find place in this chain will distinguish what you consider fun .a younger crowd will enjoy attending parties , attending night clubs , doing rather challenging and more physically tiring sports .a middle age person might achieve enjoyment from playing a game of chess or maybe going to the opera and for that middle age person person , attending noisy parties and doing dangerous sports might not be enjoyment at all .therefore , depending the age that you have , whatever you do will will bring upon it the correct benefit .there is a typically trend that young people believe that they enjoy life more than an older person because they believe that the younger you are the more fun you can have , this i believe is incorrect because , yes of course , the younger you are the more options of enjoyment you might think to have .for example , a fatehr of a child would rather much spend time with his son or duaghter rather than attend a gathering full of 20 year olds just because he has different priorities .a young person would not enjoy spendign tiem with relatives or older members of his fmaily simply because at that age , you tend to have different obligations , different points of interest and different type of mentality .younge rpeople tend to fell that as your odl you miss out on what is really fun , but we must remember that older people where young at one point and what a young person thinks an older person will never dream of doing , might just probably mean that it was already done .therefore , i do not believe that the younger you are the more fun you have but rather , the older you are your taste of fun change and you rpriorities differ .enjoyment can be derived from many aspects of life and it is not only allocated to the young adults .
