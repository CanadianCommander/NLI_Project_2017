that young people enjoy life more than older people is certainly a highly unqualified statement .one can almost never make such broad and sweeping generalizations .having said that , however , i do believe that younger people on average tend to have an easier time enjoying life than older people do .i epmhasize the words `` on average  , since there clearly are examples of vivacious , joyful elders that are much happier than glum , dejected teenagers .therefore , being old does not necessarily mean being incapable of enjoying life , whereas being young does not guarantee happiness .however , i have reasons to believe that being young makes it easier to enjoy life .the first and most obvious explanation for this is health .younger people are bound to be healthier than older ones : their immune systems tend to be stronger , the time that it takes for younger people to recover from wounds and diseases is shorter and their motoric abilities are stronger .young people can therefore engage in a variety of activities that they characterize as fun , whereas the elderly are prevented by their aformentioned disadvantes from doing so .take my grandmother ; she used to be an active hiker .she would stop at nothing , and even conquered one of the highest mountains in europe , the mont blanc .however , with increasing age ( she is 76 now ) her bones and joints would no longer support any such activities : she decided , therefore , to abandon hiking .of course , this did not plunge her into a depression ; nonetheless , it represented a sacrifice and deprived her of one source of pleasure .i can not overemphasize , however , the risk of jumping to conclusions based on this example ; the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  still remains unqualified .to come back to my grandmother : with her resourcefulness , she managed to find sources other than hiking that give her enourmous pleasure .she found out , for instance , that she loved playing backgammon and even joined a club .she rediscovered her love of reading , an activity that she has nt pursued intensively due to her many distractions .one could say that she as just as happy now , at age 76 , as she was when she was still young .it is clear from these examples that ones happiness ultimatley depends oneself , rather than on one s age .nonetheless , old age does impose restrictions that require one to be resourceful and vivacious if one seeks to retain happiness .not everyone can muster these things .my conclusion is , therefore , that young age does make it easier to enjoy one s life even though one s individual character is the ultimate factor .
