in my country in korea , there are time to helping their communities in elementary , middel , highschool .they have sixty hours a year , so they make them helping communities .so they help their communities not one-self .these system show that young people nowadays do not want and give enough time to helping their communities .there are several reasons on this situation .frist , nowadays young peopel do not perticipate the importance of their community .so they think one-self is the most importance .the do not think of their communities , so they could not think of helping their communities .this situation is cased by only one child custom .many parents do not want to have many childern , so many families have only one son or daughter .this son or daughter can not have their sisters or brother , they do their own .in addition , these days young people have many thing to do .for example , when my cousin who is in eleven years old finished the school , she goes to learn about piano , math , so on .when she finished her schaduel , the time indicates the evening .otherwise , they can not have enough time to do another things .in brief , i firmly agree with nowadays young people have more time to helping their communities .young people need to thought of helping their communities , and we are not live alone .we should know the importance of community .also , governments should young people keep this thought continue .
