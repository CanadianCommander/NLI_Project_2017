nowadays more and more young people do nt care about their livning communities .they spend a lot of time on their study works in school or cream school .even they have free time they may use it on their entainment activities , like go shoping with friends or family .although there still some young people have pay some attention to their communities , it is my believe that they do nt give enough time to help their communities .the first reason that caused the young people ca nt devote more time to their communities is that the high competitive pressure in the education system .their parents wish their child can get a good grades in different subjects that caused them need to attend different courses .even ater the day time from the school , they need to take some courses in the cram school to do some supplements .in addition , while they have free time after the hard work in their study .they usually use it to do some entainments , like see the movie or sing the song in the ktv with their classmates or friends .furthermore , due the the busy work of their parents that cause the fathers and mothers did nt have much time to edcuate their kids , not to metion to teach their kids to do something helpful to their communities .so from point of veiw , if we want to encourage the young people to do more in our communities , we need to take more effort on our education .firstly , we need to encourage the parents to take their children to attend some activity in our community .let these young people to know more their society .then in the school , we need to allocate more time to teach the importance of helping communities , not just ask the student to focus on their study .through these improvement , i believe the young people will pay more time in their community than before .and the problems in the community will reduce and whole socity will become more stronger .
