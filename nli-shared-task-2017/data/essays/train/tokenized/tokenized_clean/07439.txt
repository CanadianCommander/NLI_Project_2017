i definately agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i have to admit that i am not the type of person that watches a lot of television and i am also not paying too much attention to advertisements i see on newspapers or magazines .however , it happened a few times in my life that i trusted in what i saw on tv , but i do not want to mention all the disappointing moments i had , trusting too much what i have seen on the advertisements .so let us try to imagine what is in the `` company s mind  .since it is the aim of an advertisement to make it look great and to make it seem like you , the customer , really needs it , the company has to do everything in order to make you believe that the product is great .the consequence is that marketing plays with pictures , sounds , words , and emotions so that the customer gets appealed to the product .if this mathes with reality or not does not matter at all .even the last `` finish  on the computer makes the product look a thousend times better than in real life .what matters is that the product sells - and that s why it has to look great .in order to sell the product the company has to make up an image that really makes you think that there is no better product available on the market .- that s why we think we have to spend money in detergent that makes clothes whiter than white or in tooth paste that makes teeth cleaner that clean .sometimes you sit there and wonder how it can be possible that you are fooled that way .looking at the facts , it is widely known that companies spent thousands of dollars in market research for the purpose of finding out how the breaking of a cookie has to sound in order to be sold or what color the tomato on the big-mc-advertisement has to have so that it looks appealing to the buyer .maybe it helps us , as the consument , to view advertisements as a plain product information , just to find out what is there on the market and not rely too much on the opinion , the value , the image it is trying to come across .then we do not have to worry whether the product is better or not , but just make up our mind on our own .it is obvious that reality is not as colorful , tasty , clean , white - whatever you want to take as an example - as the advertisents make you think in the first place .however , if you as the customer keep that in mind you do not get too disappointed and still can enjoy your big-mc .
