i do not agree with the idea that successful people are the ones that try new things and take risks , instead of only doing what they already know how to do well .there are several reasons that make me not agree with this statement , but i would like to concentrate in three of them .firstly , i do not believe that been a risk taker or an innovative person is a necessary condition to achieve success in life or your professional field .in fact , every aspect of life ( interpersonal relations , family , labor relations , religion , social life ) and academic discipline , or professional field , require a different approach to succesffully interact and solve problems .secondly , taking risks might lead to failure .even though failing is not always negative , it represents an interruption on a task or process , which certainly causes delays on accomplishing a project s goal or task .thus , incurring in activities or behaviors that involve high chances to fail will definetely not lead to success .lastly , it is important to considering that in fact , doing the same things leads you to specialization , which will make you an expert on doing something or in a specific field and probably a successful and well-known person in that particular area .opposite , it is really difficult for someone to do something new or an invention if he or she does not know the object or field .this means that people require certain amount of knowledge and familiarity with a field or object to actually make a new thing that will deliver personal success .i believe that the key to success is not hidden behind being the most original or risk taking person , but to actually get to know what you do .going deep into one activity , dealing with it in a daily basis will allow someone to achieve success .
