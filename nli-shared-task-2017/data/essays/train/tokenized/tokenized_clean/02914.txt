i agree .history has teach us that successful people take risks .when people take risks they take the dificult path .a more complex and difficult path its in front of them .they are in front of the unknow .the unknow its a very difficult path becuase people do not know what its going to hit them next .important is when the people accomplish the unknow and make a use of it , they become a successful man .i want to become a successful man , and for that reason i need to take risks .the risks that im going to take is to go away to a different country and study there .a new world with out my famiy is going to shape my soul .im going to learn new things and take new risks .i am trying to become a better man .i am trying to become a better person , and that is success for me .in the path of success there are many unknow traps .i have to learn from the traps and use them in my future life .i could stay in my house and do what i do well .i know i can be a successful man doing what i know already well .but i ca nt stay home and not try to accomplish my dreams .i feel a successful person has to accomplish treir dreams and take new risks .this is the second time i take the toefl exam .i need 90 points and i got 89 .do you thing im going to stop there .no , i need to take risks and do the exam again and again until i pass .a successful person is someone who acomplish what ever they are looking for .when you want to accomplish something you have to take risks and do not stop ; you have to try new things and do not stop until you accomplish your dreams .my dreams is to study in sydney and im not going to stop taking risks until i accomplish that .becouse that mekes me a successful man .that is what successful people try new things .i believe people have only one life and they have to take the best out of it .for that reason there is a need of every successful man to take risks .thank you ,emilio chalita
