nowaday , an increasing number of people like travelling .someone said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because the guide know the place deeply than the travellers , and a group of people will make more funs .but others think that travel with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfertable .and i m one of them .first of all , if you have a tour guide and a group of companiers , you will feel not very free .travelling with a tour guide , the plan will be formerly ordered , somethings you want to see a other thing or want to go to another place will not be alloweded .you ca nt change the plan .but for me , the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like , but i ca nt change , because of the whole groud .that makes me feel very upset .and a large mount of people will have a large mount of oppinions .it s difficult to recognize the idea .and some people will not follow the rules .once i joined a travelling group , but we have to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some sceneries .i felt that s a waste of my time .then , travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy , you ca nt visit one thing in a comfertable way , there s only limited time that you can stay in one place .the whole journey is in a quick pace that you ca nt enjoy it .and most of the tour guides will let you to some place whice they will get benifits from it .but this kind of place really wastes our life .as a result , as for as i am concerned , i think travelling only will one or two best friend or relatives without a tour guide is more free and comfertable .
