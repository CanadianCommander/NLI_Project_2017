in my opinion this statement is true .i think this is since young people are at the beginning of there lives and not in the middle or at the end of it .you can reccognise it if you start a new work .generally at the beginning it is interesting , because you have never done it before , but after a few weeks or month you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting .here are some examples why from my point of view , young people enjoy it more to live than old people .when you are young you have a lot of changes .you grow up , become interested in the other sex and have to go to school .you have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not .it does not care you .on the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there lives .the most grown up people i know , have a house or an appartement somewhere , children and a job .those people have really not a lot of changes in there lives .the time schedule is nearly every week the same .however i know some other peoples who have a completly different way of live .for example one guy i know , he is 50 years old now , stopped to work with fourty .he has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live .so he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world .he works from time to time if he can at a bare in jamaica , but only one ore two months in a year .i think in his case the mentioned statement is wrong .he never stoped to be young .i think that he enjoys everz daz like it would be his first on this planet .with this sentence i would like to say that the sentence wich i am writing about is not absolutely true .however generally i have the same impression .
