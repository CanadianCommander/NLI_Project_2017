overall i would disagree with this statement , i believe that travelling on an independent basis is more rewarding even if it is more challenging .i usually like to do my homework beforehand about places i want to visit and plan it myself to a certain extent .i am very much interested in the history of places i am visiting as well as the local culture of the inhabitants , therefore i prefer a travel formula that maximises my interacion with these local residents .this planning and interaction with people will enrich the trip many folds versus going with a group led by a tour guide where the information one would receive is prepared and digested and then presented to the traveller .i have travelled to southern spain many years ago , i had planned my trip to a certain extent only and i discovered many locations that were not pointed in tourist pamphlets , just by walking down the streets and talking to people .this is what i call the surprise effect of trips , see the unexpected by going places not necessarily frequented heavily by tourists , this allows me to interact in a more personal way with local residents of areas i am visiting and have a better feel of the life of these people .travelling indepently gives me more control over my time , i can manage it the way that works better for me , i can stay longer in a place if i deem necessary , or i can just pack up and leave to `` greener pastures  if i get bored in a particular location .also there is the financial aspect of it , i find it more cost effective to travel on your own than with a tour guide .i can choose to settle in less expensive hotels and have my own agenda as far as meals are concerned during my trip .of course going on a loner basis may pose some challenges and maybe some risks in certain situations but overall it is a much more interesting and rewarding approach .
