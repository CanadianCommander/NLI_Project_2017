according to this topic i can neither agree nor disagree .on the one hand young people have a lot of energy for instance they can dance through the whole night or go in for every kind of sports they like .regularly they do not have physical problems and they know that they have lots of life-time .but on the other hand they are often struggeling with themselves .first love , future and a lack of experience etc. are difficulties in their lives .personally i am often so worried about my future , my job perspectives and so on that i can not sleep in the evening .older people are more experienced .although they have got problems , too , they mostly take them easier .they know life goes on .that is why they see the things differently and can enjoy other things than younger people .after years of good and bad times they can analyze situations in another way .if your are young you want to change the world , you are thinking about the big things .when you are getting older your values change .my mother is a good evidence for this .she told me that went on parties as she was younger and that this was her way of enjoying life .but today she enjoys staying at home with the family , she enjoys cooking and playing with my little cousins .maybe older people think more positive about life and to my mind that is a sign for life quality .maybe older and younger people have just another way of enjoying life , but neither younger nor older people enjoy life more like the other group .so personally i feel that it is impossible to decide wheather young or old people enyoy life more .especially the fact that i am young makes it impossible .so i have to become older and maybe then i will be able to answer this question in a better way .
