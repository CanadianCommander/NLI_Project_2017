i do not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first of all , car industry is now developing very fast in the developing countries such as china and india .these countries have large numbers of population .large population means big potential of car comsuming .people living in these countries are becoming richer and richer .therefore , more and more people in these countries are able to buy a car .in the future 20 years , the number of these group of people will grow bigger so there would be more cars in developing countries in twnety years .secondly , in developed countries , most of the families have their own cars .cars play a very important part in people s livies .people will feel very unconvenient if they do not have a car .this situation will change little in twenty years .although scientists has created many kinds of new tranfic machines , none of them could take the place of cars .cars have influence people s livies so significant that it is impossible to change the situation in twenty years .thirdly , the style of cars may change a lot in the future .it is true that resources on the earth are declining very fast .it is also possible that one day we would have no petrol to fill our cars .however , i believe that human beings can find new resources used for cars to take the place of petrol .in fact , nowadays there are many cars which use electricity .i think this techology will be very useful in twenty years .it is much more practical and cheaper to improve the cars than to creat a totally new trafic machine to solve the resource problems .cars have served people all around the world for nearlly 100 years .car industry and car science have improved a lot in these years .i think scientists could find out new ways to make cars more useful , more suitable , more clean and more popular .to sum up , it is very possible that there will be more cars in use than there are today .
