for the past four years i have been the director of a group of misionary adolescents that helps impoverished communities in the caribbean , and south/central america .as a part of the program , we developed a cultural dimension to it .we have traveled all over the americas , the caribbean and europe .i have been the planner of the excursions , trips and tourism .in the process , i have learned that the best way to travel is without a tourguide .usually the tourguides tend to plan and direct an excursion or trip based upon their own interests .therefore , you re completely attached to the person s caprices and circumstances .tourguides exist as consecuence of the capitalist society and are nt neccesary .they are part of economic processes and do nt consecuently appeal to cultural knowledge and interraction .for example , i once took a tour , led by a person who told us that he has been working for the company for almost twenty years `` [ this meant that he had a vast knowledge on the themes he was exposing ]  .when i asked him a question i already knew but wanted to confirn my hypothesis about the tour-guides , he exposed an irrelevant answer on the theme , and redirected the consersation .on the other hand , the tour was programed to visit all the shopping malls and and places that seemed to have some kind of economic dimension .the tour itself appealed the personal interests of the persons who organized it .i have organized all the tours i have done in my life .i jhave learned the best way to plan a trip is to do it yoursel .
