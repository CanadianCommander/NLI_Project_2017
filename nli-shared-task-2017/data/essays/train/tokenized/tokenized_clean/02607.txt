i do not agree with this statement .i believe that we are , now , able to see what it shows really in advetisements .i will tell you reasons using advertisement of car makers .first , we are having , now , real eyes which we did not have about 40 years ago where tv advertisement was introduced .at that time every car shown on the screen might have seen much better than it really were .because we could not get much information of cars as it depended on only visuality .but now we have so many sauces of infomation , for example car magazin , special internet site and so on , in order to know real products of cars .after we collect all , we can know the reality .second , whenever we saw advertisement , we became to suspect what it said on screens or papers .in other words , we became wiser enouth to know the real products .now we are living in the world full of information , we became carefull whenever we buy anything .finaly , when we plan to buy a car , we are trying to find the information from our side .we are not just waiting for it anymore from car makers .the meaning of advertisement has been changed since the internet had been introduced .advertisement gives us a chance to show where we could find our desired information .as a conuif advertisements tries to make us deceive , it does not work any more in the modern time .
