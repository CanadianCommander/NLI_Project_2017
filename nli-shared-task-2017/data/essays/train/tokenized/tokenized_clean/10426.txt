while we start learning something , we have to understand the ideas and concepts first .it seems to be critical for us to learn those things first so that we can build the foundation of what we are going to learn .actually , if we just understand the concepts or ideas and we do nt understand the facts .eventually , we are not really learning something .from my point of view , to understand ideas and facts are both important .there are wide variety of examples in our daily lives can prove my view point .i am taking psychology class right now .last week , my teacher talked about how to analyze dreams .i got to learn the basic concepts of analyzing dreams .when i understood the concepts , i wrote down one of my dreams to my teacher .then , she analyzed it for me .as a result , it was not really accurate about what i thought and what i was going to do .then , she told me that fact and concept might not be the same ; therefore , we had to learn both .on the othe hand , if we are going to learn sports .first of all , we will learn concepts and how to play .then , we will get to learn skills .can we just learn the concepts and we will be good at it ?we must practice and play games so that we can learn the fact that what will it really happen while a game .we may not be able to use all the ideas while we play the game .to conclude , students must understand both ideas and facts .those are crutial for out learning .we ca nt lack either one during our learning processes .
