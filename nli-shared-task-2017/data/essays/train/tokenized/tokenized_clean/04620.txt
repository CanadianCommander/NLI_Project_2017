i am agree with that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific .someone around me i like them very much .it is because them have many knowledge to share with me , and from different subjects .i am a person who always keep a heart of curious , i want to know every thing around me , why the birds fly , why machines work , i ask and ask , my friends give the answers , i think they are mr.know-all .it is not the most important reason for this topic .however , i may use a exampel to say .there is a chinses book wrote by many centries ago .people agrued about whether it is wrote by one person or two , and who is the second writer .many people searched in libery , history .but they had not succeed .about 50 years ago , a people who is specialized in stastics , gave us the answer with stastics mothed .he compered the signs , marks and languege signals , and then , he find out the book was really wrote by two different writers .also , as you know , in science , physics and chemistry can not be without each other .with out chemistry , physics can not describe something happened .be very proudly , there was a great chinese teacher thounsands years ago had talk about this topic .he said , if you had study one subject to the end , then you had already study others to the end .it is hard to say that to specialize in one specific subject is not so good .however , in my opinion , it is too narrow .a wide knowledge will give us a good reason to carry on our study .that s all .
