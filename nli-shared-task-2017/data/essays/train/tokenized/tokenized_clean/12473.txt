the statement of `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  is a fact .adversetising is the engine of many companies all around the world , companies that could not sell a unit of their products if they could not have access to advertisment agencies .for example , everyone is aware of the hazzards of drinking soda but because the companies that produce soda invest millions of dollars on advertising , they keep selling milions of units all around the world .another clear example that supports the statement is tobacco companies ; companies like the worldwide company phillips-morris wich business is to sell as many cigarrettes as they can , even though they are awared about the consequences of smokingas they customers do , they keep incresing their profits year after year because they great investing on advertising , this is what permits them to show their product as something that is neither bad nor good , just as something that exists .usually many products fails because their marketing policies , some companies with really good products had declare out of business after putting out their products without a good marketing support or many companies with regular products have been successfull because of it ; one example of this , is that millions of clothes companies exists around the world but no all of them are known in different countries and they do not sell as the known ones do ; many brands are selled in the world , brands like tommy hilfigher , diesel , perry ellis among to many , but is not their quality or any other specific characteristics that these brands are so successfull , is just their marketing policies what permits them to succeed over the companies that have no marketing policy .in summary there is no statement that can be so real as `` most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are  .
