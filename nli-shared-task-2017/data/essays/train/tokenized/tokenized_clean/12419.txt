travel can be a good present to a person who is tired or bored with an ordinary busy life .it can be a time for a new adventure or a time for taking a rest .some people prefer traveling with a group and a tour guide .others choose a trip by themselves or with their family and friends .personally , i prefer to travel with my family and friend or just by myself without a tourguide .trip in a group with a tour guide can be cheaper because of possible group discounts and agency deals .also , i do nt need to do my research for the place i want to visit during the trip .all i need to do is to show up the place where i am supposed to meet a group and a tour guide and to follow predetermined schedule .it sounds very convenient .however , there is limited freedom in a group tour .i may not visit the places i wish to go , must wait for others , can not eat the restaurant i choose , and can not change schedules even if i want to .furthermore , i am usually not able to choose a group i am with nor a tour guide .if i am unlucky , that trip can be a pain to bear with somebody uncomfortable .when i was in school , i visited bangkok with a group led by a tour guide .the reason i chose the group tour was that it was a very good deal .there were 35 individuals in my group in different ages .frankly speaking , it was very unpleasant because there were some people distracted .they spent too much time on shopping and rest of us had to wait for them .because a tour guide get a commission , he did nt stop them rather encourage them to purchase more .i wasted a lot of time in the bus waiting for others .also , i could nt eat the restaurant i wanted to eat .i could nt stay a place long enough i enjoy the view .besides of above reasons i pointed out , i want to have some good memories which will last long after the trip .for a group tour , i do nt need to do any research for the trip except checking schedules .thus , there are not a lot of memories i can have later .i would like to have a travel with full of unpredicted events .i may visit places nobody else visit since no tour guide goes there .there could be some challenges .but through overcoming them , i will improve myself more .thus , the best way to travel for me is definitely not in a goup led by a tour guide .
