in general i do not agree with the satetment that most advertisementes make products seem much better than they really are .i say `` in general  , because there are some exceptions where the advertisment shows you the perfect situation , which in real life is unlikely to happen .from the top of my head i can recall an advertisment that showed two people in a laundry room .destiny or the same brand of cigarettes got them together , showing in the end that they lived together happily ever after thanks to that one situation .this is a clear case where they show cigarettes and smoking a lot better than it is .another example would be the adverts selling services , a bank , supermarket , a public office , etc , are some unfortunate examples of how the service shown has nothing to do with reallity .however , most of the advertisments people are exposed to have no other alternative than to show you the product .so , when you see a car ( for instance ) , you have a realistic and clear idea of what the car is like .evenmoreso , the adverts make easier to the buyer the process of the decission at the time of the purchase after having a first visual contact with it through the advert .also they can save time once a person knows exactly what is looking for .to conclude , i think that people should always appeal to common scense .think about their needs and economical posibilities , and not get carried away by fantasies or advertisments in the few cases where the advert shows a product much better than it really is .
