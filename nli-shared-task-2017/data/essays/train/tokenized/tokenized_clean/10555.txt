in the modern society , with the general growth of population and knowledge , more and more jobs and fields of study are available .therefore , it has become a difficult task to choose a way of study .is that better to specialize on a particular academic subject or to keep a good overall knowledge in many subjects ?as far as i am concerned , i would first disagree with the idea that having a broad knowledge is the best thing to do .indeed , specialists are nowadays more than necessary because we are always discovering new things and expending our knowledge .nobody can keep in touch with the latest discoveries in every domain .for instance , one of my teachers is a searcher in a very specific field : model driven development in computer sciences .thanks to him and his colleagues , new features of programming have discovered and are now used by a lot of people .because this teacher has been fond of his speciality since his childhood , he has made and still makes some important work on this particular field of computer sciences .moreover , when he is teaching us , we can fell he his giving us the latest and most accurate knowledge available .this helps us understanding and appreciating the subject .thus , it can be a good thing to specialize in a specific domain mainly when you like it .on the other hand , it is important to say that it would nt be good if there were only specialists in our societies .actually , as i just said , it is more and more difficult to know a lot of things in many domains .so specialists concentrate on a special branch of a domain .sometimes , they can even work on very specific topics like `` how do the electrons pass through the silicium in a transistor  .this kind of work has to be handled by people who are not really specialists but who know how the results of the research can be used .these persons with a broad knowledge are also essential .they are the only one who can coordinate the works and give them some utility .they act as a manager in a company .in conclusion , i would say that both academic curriculae ( broad or specific ) can be good .at least , they are both useful in society .in fact , the choice depends on the personality of the student and the possibilities in the university .
