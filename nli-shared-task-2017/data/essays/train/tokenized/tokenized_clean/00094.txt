education is the most important thing in our modern society - someone with good skills have much more opportunities to succeed in his professional life than someone with low skills or education .the main goal of school is to well-train young generation in order for them to adapt and improve our fast progress society .there are mainly two ways of education : one way that allow students to understand by themselves theories , concepts or ideas by different means such as scientific experiences or self thinking and a second way that provide to them all teachings without real understanding .someone who really understand the roots of things is better trained as can shape things based on the fundamental knowlegde he has .on the contrary , a student who only learn the facts and does not understand the principle or concept will at any time applied what he has learnt but will be inefficient in a general case .this last can never shape things or invent new things as he does not have the capability of thinking by himself .however , thanks to the new technology , it seems sometimes even not necessary to understand concepts to accomodate in this society .many people who are trained - in the new sciences & technology like the internet , without having the fundamental knowledges , are as good as those who spend time on getting the real concept .it seems useless to get fundamental knowledge and people are living and succeding in their work based on their education of learning only the facts .to conclude , we think that understanding the real concepts of main subjects is important and required but students can not master all concepts , which will not prevent them from being good students .
