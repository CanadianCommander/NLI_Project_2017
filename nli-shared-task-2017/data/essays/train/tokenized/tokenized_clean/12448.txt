many people have asserted that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .although it would be easy to reject this statement , it s such a complex one .personally , i agree with this statement .in the following paragraphs , i d like to present some examples to support my points of view .first of all , a successful person should have the following good qualities : creativity and to do something to the best .for example , edison invented the electric light bulb .he tried so many times , and eventually , he succeed .without his tring and breave , we might used candles to light up until now .after he invented the electric bulb , he found that the form of the the electricity might be a problem .so , he tried direct electric and alternative ealetric , tried to find out which one was suited for today s usage .trying something new is always important for advancing our life .so , the people try something new and take the risk could be called successful person .for instance , the invented of the computer amd use it to get on the internet .nowaday , computer almost involved in every event , such book ticket , buy clothes , and obtain information .without those man tried to invent computer , we ca nt do those things i have describe above .they might be failed , but in my mind , those who could try new things and take risks are the succesful person .althought there is also a arguement in the opposite position to be made on this issue .nevertheless , for the reasons i have presented above , i believe my points of view are the most valid .
