i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , but i believe that this problem can not be limited to young people but extends to older generations as well .to begin with , from my experience , only few young people are involved in their communities .peer pressure , the fear of seeming ` uncool  to their friends or just lack of interest might be the most common reasons .this is a very sad development , i believe , since community work brings people of different backgrounds together .community work can , thus , contribute to strenthening people s sense of responsibility and their open-mindedness .nevertheless , i do not believe that the problem is limited to young people .particlarly in larger cities , where life tends to be more anonymous , only few people dedicate time to the community .i do not think , however , that this development is inevitable .my experience is that you can get people involved if you are convinced of what you are doing and you can transport this excitement to others .for example , i have been working in my university s amnesty international group for four years now .in our work we also regularly visit schools to tell students about what we do and to gain support for our group .the students  reactions are always very positive in that they are usually ready to help and support our work .as a conclusion , in my view , this example shows that the problem will not be solved on its own .in my opinion , the lack of sense of responsibility for the community is not only a problem among young people but extends to our society as a whole .if we want younger and older people to get involved , we have a responsibility to offer opportunities and to be role-models .changes in society are hard to achieve .we should nonetheless make an effort - every single one of us .
