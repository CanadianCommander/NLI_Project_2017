it is often said that selling products honestly is the most important commercial norm .however , i would like to maintain that effective advertisements help the products approach to customers because i believe that packaging products is more important than the product itself and advanced promotion of the products must be crucial before their launching in markets .first , outer appearance which can be described as packaging or design is really important for customers .some of them may think highly of it rather than inner elements .for instance , we can witness modern economic conception of marketing .it gives different values to product except the actual productive quality .when we see the advertisement of apple s ipod or starbucks , we do not only consider its flavor or taste , but their design , logo , symbols etc .for modern customers , design must be one of the important criterions .therefore , great advertisements are really important to custosecond , a new product can not be welcomed in markets without appropriate advertisements .customers can not purchase the product unless they know it is now available .it is a fundamental function of advertisements of a new product .on the other hand , i remember a falling motor company s advertisements dramatically changed the company s fortune .that is korean kia motor company .although it was about to face a bankruptcy , the company s advertisement of a new model stimulated customers  buying desire .we can simply see how effective advertisements provide the company with the opporunity of survival in competitive markets of motor companies .in summary , i would like to emphasize how advertisements are one of the fundamental steps as well as of the important choices of commerce .i am also confident that appropriate advertisements would result in unchanging loyalty from customers .
