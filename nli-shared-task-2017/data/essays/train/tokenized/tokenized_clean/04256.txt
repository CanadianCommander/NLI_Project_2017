to be a wise enough person people should know lots of thing from different fields .however knowing everything is not possible even for the machines having a large capasity of memory .in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject because one may do not have a conclusion while dealing with details , it is not possible to be good in all fields , filling the memory is not necessary .firstly , if one tries to investigate and make a knowledge of many subjects then he will not have time to make his conclusion or even he may not have a conclusion .if he specialize and investigate the other fields just when he need , then he must go in details so the possibility to have a conclusion is higher .for instance , as an academic research area mathematics is so wide even in the branches .it already takes so much time to learn one field .if one tries to know all the details in other branches then it is impossible to have an article about his research .secondly , it is impossible to be an expert in every fields .finally , human memory is not so wide to keep everything .the things that is not used anymore will be deleted after a time .so filling the memory with the things that will not be used is unnecessary , since it is not necessary to know everything .in conclusion , it is better to work on a specific subject than to work on many subjects .
