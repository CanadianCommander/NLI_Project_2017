what is a succussful people ?usually people will say that he should be famous and do very well in a particular thing .but in my opinion , if you want be a succussful people , you should have brave to try new things and take risks .first of all , if people try new things , it is easier and fast to success .because in this developed society , competition is the most important problem for companies or schools .we should invent a new techinoli to make differences from others that decreases the competition .although it has more risks that doing what people know how to do well , several people still want to challege what common people usually ca nt do , it s easire and fast for them to be successful .secondly , successful people have brave to challege himself .people wants to increase the vaule of himself , so thet decide to try new things .
