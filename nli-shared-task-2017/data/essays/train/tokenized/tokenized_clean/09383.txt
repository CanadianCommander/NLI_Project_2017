i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think that probably younger people have more opportunities to lead a pleasant life , unaware of dangers , economicall worries and age - related illneses ; but i do believe that young people have less wisdom to realize that those opportunities must be well used to get joy in to their lives .i often see young people overdriven to acomplish things in such a short time , that they can not possibly realize that they are missing important and joyful experiences on their path .young people are more and more feeling the pressure to do a lot , at the cost of enjoying less .this pressure comes from society , family , their peers , and sadly from themselves , pushing more and more to excel in so many things at the time , that they just end doing everything automatically , without stopping to see what they have acomplished .even though older people can be very driven to succeed , years have taugth them that as important as get things done , is the experience of doing them .i have seen myself stressed and feeling unfulfilled after long hours in a supposedly joyfull experience , as an over planned trip , scheduled by the hour to maximize the eyesightings .i have also seen my grandfather enjoying himself a lot by just sitting close to the window with a cup of strong tea , reading a magazine or watching the people who pass by the street .there are pleasures of the older people that can not compare to some rush and excitement that young people can get from partying all night and leading an accelerated life .there is the possibility to see the kids grow and become nice people , who will honor the values they where raised in .and there is of course the possibility to enjoy grandchildren , who can be spoiled by the grand parents while the parents struggle to teach them manners ant get them to bed early .i also think that older people enjoy more life because they get a sense of a `` job well done  about their families , jobs or whatever commitment they had in life , whereas young people are still trying to find their purpose .older people often have ( or make ) more time , to devote themselves to thing they find enjoyable , as learning something special or talking to people with related interests .my grandmother spent long hours working two jobs when she was younger to be able to raise her kids , and never had much of a hobby , but now that she has retired , she has found great satisfaction in taking cooking lessons with neighbors that became real friends .i am finally realizing that life can be more enjoyable than what it has been to me in the past , but this is probably because i am starting to age myself . ..i wonder if as years pass i will find more joy on the little things , and if i will be able to be delighted by seeing the passersby as my grandfather does , but i do think that with age , more things will come too , that will make me very happy .to summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .
