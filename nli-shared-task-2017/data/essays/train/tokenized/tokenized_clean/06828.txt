obviously , the aim of advertisement is to make products seem much better than they really are .i do nt see any point to disagree with this statement .if a certain advertisement is failing to stimulate this impression , this means that this advertiser is simply a bad advertiser .however , this does not mean that advertisement is simply a lie and advertisers are wellcomed to lie given advertisement is the art of lieing ! .advertisement also has to have its ethics .the positive impression in the minds of the consumer is to be created not by outright lies but by emphasizing the attractive aspects of the product in question .if the product in question is an expensive and good product , many advertisement wisely omit to mention its price .if the product is cheap , the advertisements would proudly emphasize its exact price .this kind of selective speaking is true not only for commercial advertisements but also true in our daily lives .if we were to mention a certain man , one can only mention his positive sides whereas another one can only speak of his negative sides .both men would still be talking the reality .as long as people speaking about a third person and as along as the advertisers while presenting his product are honest , there is no ethical question .to lie outrightly and to speak selectively about reality are two different things .in a commercial world , it is not realistic to expect us to criticize their own product !the advertisements also perfectly know the weak sides of the consumers .they know what attracts them and what distracts them .using the insight of pyschology , they benefit from the temptations of consumers .but this is one side of the coin .the consumers also know how advertisemnets are .they also learn that advertisements polishes the products and aim to create a fairy tale image .the consumers use advertisements for knowledge .they are not stupid enough to be deceived by the advertisements .they are educated by the advertisements themselves of the characteristics of the advertisements .a typical consumer is more or less able to distinguish what is real and what is fiction in advertisements .to conclude , although i agree with the statement , the statement has to be qualified .recognizing the fact that advertisements make the products look better than they really are does not mean that advertisers are a bunch of criminals lieing unashamedly to the whole people .they make the positive sides of the products accessible to the consumers .it is up to the consumers to make their decision and to agree or disagree with the advertisers .
