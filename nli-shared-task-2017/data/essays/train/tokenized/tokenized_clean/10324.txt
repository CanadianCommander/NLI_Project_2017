i agree the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is certainly true that taking risks sometimes scares person and make hesitate to doing something new .however , i have seen people who get to succeed due to taking risks in thire life .first of all , it is often said that high risk makes high returns .my father-in law invest the almost of his saving and posetions on bigining a new bussines when he was in mid twenties .it is really challneging incident .he resighed the company he worked as a employee .it meaned he lost his stable and countinus income .if the invest was failed , it is difficult to live form tommorrow .he could not afford his wife and children at that time .however , he s bussiness was succeed and he earn much money than before .he could make his children to take a good education and he is living without financial worries now .secondly , this is not such a successful story but may be my trivial experience .i tend to try new things always .for example , i often go to the new restaurant to seek the new receip and taste .sometimes it ends to fail because new taste was not suitable for my favourite .however , i feel very excited when i looking for new rentaurant and this proccess makes me happy .i lrealized from my experience that seeking for something new makes people happy and excited .i think that this is essential and important atittude to lead success in one s life .finnaly , i think that it is boring only to do what they already know how to deal with .it would make your everyday life routine work .we feel excited only when we have some stimulates from new things .from avove three reasons , i definitly agree the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
