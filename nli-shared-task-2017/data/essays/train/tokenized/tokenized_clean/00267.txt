i disagree with the given statement because , with a tour guide , we can not go wherever we want .with a tour guide , the places we vist will be severely limited , because everything including hotels to say , stores to go and places to see are all fixed before the trip .it kills an enjoyable part of traveling .the travel plan by traveling agencies usually includes only famous places , so even if we can go to grand canyon , for example , by the tour , we can not usually visit local towns around there .but i think one of the advantages of traveling is to see and touch the local culture or ethnics .the places we go by the tour may look to have those but they actually do not .they , i believe , are for travelers and waiting for us .in order to actually feel the country or region , we need to go actual local towns or villages , where we can not go by tours .concerning above , people might say traveling in a group is easier and more convenient .however , these days there is not so much difference between traveling alone and traveling in a tour thanks to the development of information technology .i think the only merit that traveling in a tour has is that we can rely on the professional tour guides and get various kinds of information easily .but nowadays , we can use the internet and search for what is famous , the history of the region or why the place is attractive to the travelers .in other words , there is no longer information gap between ordinary travelers and professional tour guides .therefore , there is no inferiority in traveling alone to traveling in tours .traveling alone is better since we can have all rights for the places we go , and only traveling by oneself guarantees the opportunity to touch the local culture or tradition .there is no bad point in traveling alone because we can gain much information through the internet if we want to go to the places a tour usually goes .therefore , i conclude , traveling by oneself is superior to traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
