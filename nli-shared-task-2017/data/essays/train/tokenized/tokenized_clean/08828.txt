it is commonly assumed that risk and novelty are the keys to success .while most extraordinary sucess-stories are based on breakthrough ideas or products , expertise on particular existing subjects can also yield excellent results .success of a product or idea is determined by three main factors : the novelty , the marketability ( or perceived usefulness ) , and the risk taken .novelty is in itself a factor , as new things tend to impress people .light bulbs and electricity have thus opened never-before-seen vistas to civilisation .however , something being new does nt imply its actual usefulness .a new technological device could realise the exact same thing as an older device without any added value and encounter moderate success or even failure .usefulness , or good public reaction to the product , is therefore necessary for success .finally , the risk taken should be as low as possible for a product to be successful .the higher the risk , the more likely the failure !people who try new things and take huge risks are thus less likely to succeed than people who try new things . ..with few risks .however , based on the three previous assumptions , are people more successful when trying risky new things or when doing things they already master ?novelty , while conditioning both other factors , is in no way a requirement for success .people becoming experts in a particular domain have an added credibility and get the public s trust .quality is an added value to the `` perceived usefulness  of an idea or product .moreover , with extensive knowledge of a domain , the risks of failure become ever lower , thus answering to two key conditions for success .the car maker ferrari , for example , is a shiny example of success for a company that always does what it knows how to do best : automobiles .therefore , people doing what they know how to do well have a very good chance of success .to conclude , while immense successes often stem from novelty and risk , many people trying new things take risks that will lead them to failure , whereas people capitalising on their expertise are probably more likely to be successful , though in a more modest way .
