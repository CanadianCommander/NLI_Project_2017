i agree , to a large extent , that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .but let us have a look at this phrase from a different viewpoint .specially , the young people do not have enough time for themselves so the deal comes that where can they find time for helping the communities .these days young people tend to be busy with their other sources of entertainments , other medias of time spending etc .but these are just excuses of a sort and the real matter is that may be how busy a person is he/she can always find time to do what his/her preference is .so basically the young peoples mind have transformed to this extent that their beliefs pertaining to community helping are the lowest priority ones .for example consider the extent of this phenomena , that if there is a party or a live match of some sport , it is priority ` level one  .and the priority level for community help/service basically never comes into picture .this is what we call as a modern world .where people are connected through mobiles , e-mails and chats , but what is the status or problems that the first door neighbour is facing we have no idea .we would prefer asking about our friend s health on mails and chats but when it comes to visiting them in reality there arise a lot of other problems , like time constraints and conveyance problems .so the same is the case with the young people nowadays , they would like to remain in connection with a lot of people and make friends with as many people as possible but only on chats and e-mails .but this is just the primary effect of the modern world on the youth , there are other serious effects also .the prime one of them is that the young people have lost the capability to adjust with people of all ages and cultures .they believe in only one group of friends they are living with and there is no body else they want to care about outside this group .so reluctancy on part of helping the community comes automatically as a effect of the modern world s leisures .but is this effect a mass phenomena .in one sense yes .but not in all cases there are people in the young generations also that believe in community and social work culture .but it can be observed that this kind of people are quite rare and not commonplace .though our culture and texts are filled with lectures on group-functioning and team-work and social upliftment but seemingly it is very distressing to see that the kind of tools that the modern world has provided to this generation are making them divulge of their own duties .but as they say that nothing is permanent and hopefully this culture will also come to an end and the people will start thinking and will soon realise the importance of helping the community since problems do not come to a community it comes to a person and the community shares it .
