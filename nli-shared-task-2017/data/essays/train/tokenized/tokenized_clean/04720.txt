i completely agree with the statement from my personal experiences and from my observations .the good thing about traveling in a group is that it s easier for travelers .because the traveling plan is already well arranged by the tour guide , so the travelers do nt have to spend lots of time making the plan .the only thing that need is to follow the tour guide and have fun .also , since they do nt need to worry about the schedule , they can completely relax and enjoy the tour .moreover , to travel in a group is safer because the gangs wo nt easily conduct crime to the person who are in a group .there is one more benifit for traveling in a group , that is , the price is often lower due to the special discount for group people .beside , the tour guide is more professional than us , therefore the travelers can get to know many histories and bakcgrounds of the scene .fot example , from my observations , the honey moon would be the best if traveling in a group led by a tour guide .because the couple can really enjoy the trip without fighting with each other in where to go or which place to go first .as a results , the new marriage couple can maintain good relationship all along the honey moon .on the other hand , when traveling alone , travelers are taking the risks .first , since they might not be familiar with the place they re going to , the plan they made would probably expose themself into the unknown danger .second , they need to worry about their schedule all the time .that would give them the pressure when traveling and make them become nervous .third , as compare to the group , the price of traveling alone is often higher .in sum , i agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
