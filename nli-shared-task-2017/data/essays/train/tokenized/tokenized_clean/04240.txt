life according to me is like a journey and unlike any journey it has phases from juvanile to adolosent to adult and finally the old age i feel each part has its own flavour its own enjoyment .when you are a child one basically learns , trys to know more , understand things .when a adolosent he reconfigures changes and adjusts because he has to cope with a lot of restrictions , social norms and changes inside .now comes the youth when actually one is fully prepared to do things his own way come out and declare his dreams to the world and start working to achive them .actually its like when you were a child you , you were a child now you are grown up see for your-self , do for yourself and bare the consequences thus one becomes free and this freedom makes him think what is does he really wants to do what he enjoys to do , waht he can do best .this realisation of indipendence economically and on the intellectual levels makes youth the best part of the journey for all .also when you are in your 20 s you are at the best of your mental and physical ablitys earlier you were weak and later also , thus its the apex of onse energy level and capablity hence one feels high and enjoys this height .you have some more people attached to them of the same age sharing the same vibrant enthusiasm and their for you making things more exciting .so no doubt that youth is the best part .the old age i feel has its own taste its the time when you see the path back , see what ever you have done and smile .the various expriences you had and the enormous difficultys you fought with , your adventures , your notty misdeeds and grand achivements .also one gets an overall understanding of how this all evolved and proceeded , why htings were so .thus is a nice repose from the fast and tedious journey you had , you know that the point where your shadow will set you free is near but also realise that a journey is never complete till one reaches the last point of it hence you are still walking slowly , stedly and proud .
