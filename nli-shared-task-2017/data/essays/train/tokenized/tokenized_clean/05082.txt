does the entertainment and taking pleasure from life depend on the people age or not ?i believe that it is basically the character of the individual the response lies on .it is true that by the age , people have been loosing their physical activities , capacities especially in terms of participating in sporting activities .but enjoying life is not only limited by doing sport or showing the strength of your body .as we grow up  our intellectual capacity also improve .how about reading , playing bridge , doing hobbies like medels ?all depends on the character , and also for minor factors his or her background ( education ) , the environment his or her living in ( his friendship ) and financial means .if the person is positive twords the world , life itself , i definitely believe that he or she will find the way to take pleasure from life according to his or her social-economic environment .this approach is always true when we are facing with difficulties .is it acceptable approach to leave everything aside and wait for the death ?we , human beings are thinking creatures .so we have to evaluate our circumstances and act accordingly .if we take one step further in order to develop what i am suuporting that we must creat the best condition favourable for us to take more pleasure from life .
