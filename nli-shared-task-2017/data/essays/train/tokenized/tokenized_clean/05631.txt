i have travelled abroad for more than five times .half of the travels i made was with a tour guide , while the other half did nt .i have to admit that traveling with a tour guide in a group is really a easier way to travel .everything is planned by the tour guide .you do nt need to worry about where to stay in the next stop , how to get the next destination .however , if i have time to make travel plans in advance , i prefer travel on my own .i can take my time to enjoy the journey more when traveling alone than with a tour group .i like going to museums , seeing art displays and savoring the exotic cuisines .i can keep my own pace in the journey and really have a good look at the cities .the travel plans made by the travel agencies are often too packed for me .i do nt like to be in a hurry .the other thing that i like to travel alone is that i do nt need to put up with other people in a tour group .sometimes i mett members in the tour group that really have bad habits .for example , i ve been in a tour group , and one of the members in the group was often late for the scheduled time .as a result , the whole group had to postpone our next schedule just because of his lateness .compared with traveiing in a group with a tour guide , i enjoy traveling by myself more .in this way , i can really see what i want to see and i do nt have to face the inconveniences caused by some members in the tour group .
