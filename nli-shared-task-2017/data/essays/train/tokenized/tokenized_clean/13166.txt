i certainly agree that travelling in a group with a tour guide is the best option .travelling outside of the place where you live is one of the most exiting and enjoyable things to do in most peoples lives .people tend to take vacations to get away from the rigours of daily life .most people would certainly like to go alone or with an individual family if the choice existed .however most places that people consider are far away and exotic in nature , not to ignore the fact that they could be dangerous too .take for example the bali in indonesia .the recent terrorist strike in bali killed a lot of people , mostly vacationeers .going in a group offers a lot of benifits to a traveller .most airlines and hotels offer group booking discounts as well as preferential service .travelling in a group also makes you feel secure rather than travelling alone .travelling in groups would be specially advantageous to people with kids as i believe kids are better behaved and more entertained when they are in a group .going in a group with a tour guide would also help people with disabilities .also , why do something when you can have someone do it for you ?this is the type of question most people would ask when going out on a trip .instead of spending time and researching about a particular destination , it would be better to employ a local expert ( tour guide ) to guide you to the right places and explain the history and culture of that particular place .a tour guide would also be helpful incase there is an emergency and you might need to contact the local authorities or need any kind of help .also with their experience most tour guides are able to guide us to the right spots and destinations , making the most of our vacation .
