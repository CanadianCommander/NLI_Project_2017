whether young people enjoy life more than older people do or not draws a complex issue on the topic .some people may say the youth have a lot of fun , but the old does not .while the others may oppose this oppinion .if i have to choose an view , i will personally support the former claim .first of all , young people got more opportunities to have fun from various aspects of the society than the old people do .people usually take it for granted that the conception of young means having fun , which is why our society provides more facilities for the youth to do so .for example , the manufatures produce various toys for babies , children , and even young adaults .more over , many topics on tv concerns with the young , seldomly with the old .when i turn on my tv , i can find out a bounch of childen chanals as interesting as disney .especially , in some county , like china , there is only one child in a family .so both of the parents and grandparets will love her or him as precious as an apple , and provide her or him all kinds of oppertunities to have fun .additionally , young people have a lot of energy and less responsibilies , which is easier for them to have fun .on the other hand , the old has to earn money in order to sustain the family .for instance , my father always looks tired after he comes home from his office and then he even refuse himself to have fun with me , which makes me very upset .as a wise man said ( and i paragragh ) ,time is money , and time is treasure  .these words make those adaults and olds think that i can not to wast their time to have fun at all , which might not be totoally correct .admittedly , our society provides the old people more and more oppertunities and encourage them to have fun , especially then they get retired .after retiring , more and more old people feel boring and lonely at home .so they try to make more and more oppertunities for themselves to have fun .the city government ususally orgnize senior clubs which includes gym facilities , dance center , and so no .even do nt mention the chess clubs , sing clubs , ...ect .in sum , now those old have got more and more opportunities to have fun .all in all , i basically agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .inevitably , more and more opportunities are provided by the society for those old to entertain themself .now , we can say that both the youth and the old are apt to enjoy their lives in many aspects .
