several reasons make me to agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in the streets than there are today .these reasons are of various kinds .first of all , the natural ressources of our planet may not be sufficient to make it possible to produce enough energy to maintain our traffic rate .or the price of energy will be to high for one to afford having or buying a car .gas is very expensive yet , because of the various conflicts in the world , especially in the productive regions of the globe .then , i believe than alternive ways of transport will have been developed and improved .collective transports may become cheaper and lot of people may prefer them to their car .new means of transport will be found because the world public opinion is becoming aware of the dangers of pollution .and the transport sector is the only one where restrictions can be made , since progress in industry can only be made in the long term .changes in the transport sector can happen before twenty years .campaigns can promote the use of the buses or explains that biking can be a better solution than driving when living in a city .finally , new solutions can also appear .one can have difficulties to find the link between the reducing car rate and the internet , but in fact it exists .the net makes it possible to do shopping for example .one has nt to take his car anymore .if one emloyee who deliver goods at the internet users is on the road , it makes the car rate divided by two .all these solutions , even if i recognize that they sound quite unrealistic , will necessarily be examined by the decision takers .actually , they will not have choice .i believe some global measures should be discussed , as an isolated one may not be enough .
