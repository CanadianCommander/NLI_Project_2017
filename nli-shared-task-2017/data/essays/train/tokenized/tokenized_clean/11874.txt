i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .people learn things from thier own mistakes , in order to be successful , we have to face new obstacles and overcome them rather than just doing what we know and not gaining anything .first of all , all advertising companys create new product and see how we react to it even though they might loose some money for producing it .by knowing how humans react , they can get better sense of how the product works for us .they might need to improve more on the product , or they are really helpful and we might need them .by creating the new product , they get idea of how it works for us .in addition , computers and all mechanical things are part of our life .we need them in our everyday life .it needed lots of patience to create computers and telephones to make them really convenient .people tried new things that work the best for us and computers are now big part of our society .humans can not live without them , it is a source of connecting this world into smaller places .lastly , martin luther king jr. fought for equall right , he believed that all men are created equall .we can now live safely and peacefully because of his action .his speech moved lots of people , gave opportunity for others to fight for their own rights .he no longer exists but he is known for one of the successor in our life .it takes lots of risk and courage to try new things but that is how people learn things , starts to know importance of taking risk .for instance , learning foreign language will be challenging for sure but pains we experience will turn into courage and we learn to be more confident and successful .we each should try new things and prepare for some risks in order to grow ourselves as a person .
