as the famous saying goes `` necessity is mother of inventions  the necessity has no doubt lead to various inventions .many great people have learned to find new things and discovered and invented great things in all spheres of life .as these people worked hard to try new things and later came to know about the risks invoved in it .well according to be i would definitely agree the first statement that is successfull people try out new things and take risks involved in it , rather than only doing the things what we already know how to do well .people who wants to be known have to be different in their own way .as i believe that `` winners do nt do things diffently , but they do things differently  .being successfull is every indivisuals dream come true .different people have different views , hence there is probability to learn differently .hence instead of learning the things what have already known aur performed by someone else will be quite monotonic and boring .though knowledge should be gained about the already heared subject , but inventing or discovering something on our own will be quite lot interesting and exiciting .a hardworker and dedicated man who has a zeal to win in his particular field often tastes the flavour of success .trying new things and doing research work sounds exiciting to me .i remember during my undergraduate program lessons i had assisted my very honoured lecturer in his research work in electrical department , as this is my major i was really very excited about it .but through my experience i have learnt that trying out new things is not just excitement but real hardships attatched to it .learning through trial and error method is not just fun but has pains and turmoils and dedication and hardwork required .i have learned many valuable lessons through this course of study .i had got to know the importance of lecturer in a students life .i remember my lecturer was a great person he not only allowed me to learn with him but also helped me to understand it through trial and error method .he was one of my favourite lecturer and guide .at the end i would conclude on a note that being successful is not a matter of a day or two it requires hardwork and consistency .as we say that `` success does not come to you , you go to it  ! .hence i would agree that successful people try and take risks rather than only doing what we have already known and know how to do it well .
