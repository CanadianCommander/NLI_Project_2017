`` king of every thing but jack of nothing  may be point of view of few people who think broad knowledge does nt help .but i do agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .this do help in shapng the future of a person .as technology progressed the similar happened with human being .there started a race between many but the winner was one .in order to coup up with it , there is always a need of getting an upper hand among the other s .thus if we look in the field of engineering which requires a person to have knowledge related to various field in order to be higher than odds .but if that person has insufficient knowledge as he had studied only one particular subject may let him down .for example , a person who is working in an electronics company if he doesnt have any knowledge of operating and electronic transformer that will let him down in front of many .thus , if he had a sound knowledge about transformer he would have solved the problem within seconds .in school days there are number of subjects studied such as history , geography , maths etc .the real ainm behind it is to help grow knowledge of students so that they do nt encounter any problem in life .suppose if only one subject was thought then it would have affected the future of that student .i my self being an instrumwentation engineer know the actual essence of studying broad range of subject during my students life .we were successful in studying instrumentation as it contained mixture of various subjects from different branches .the main benefit i got is during my last year graduation project where i have to make and design robot .the robotics field being main part of mechanical engineering was know to me as it was in my cirriculum .thus , i completed the robotics project successfully as compair to other students .because of having studied various subjects i was able to achieve my goal of becoming a successful engineer .
