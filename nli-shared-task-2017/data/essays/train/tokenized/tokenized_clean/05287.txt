even though there can be goods arguments found against the statement that successful people try new things rather than stay at the point where they are i m of the opinion that this statement is true .to underline my thoughts following reasons are given :first , if somebody is very succesful it is usually also very self-confident .so if there is something new a successful person will not say : `` i am unable to manage this new task  .it will be rather the other way round : `` i have managed everything to my satisfaction , of course i will also manage this new task  .the risk will not be seen at first glance .so a successful person trusts in its ablities to succed .in the past everything turned out to be right ; so it will also do in the future .a failure is not to be seen as a negative experience .a failure is a possibility to do it better the next time .there is no fear to lose bo doing the new risky thing .the second reason in my opinion is that a succesful person would get bored continuing doing the same all the time .this person needs new challenge to deal with .let s take an example from the field of sports .a good tennisplayer does nt want to compete with persons playing the same level .the players has to improve and learn new techniques to be able to compete also with persons of a higher stage .it s the same in the business field .why stay be assignements already done for many times ?a new challenge is needed .new thing have to be discussed , tried even invented .otherwise there can be no step forward seen .the successful person needs to feel the success again .after having been successful in one field somebody does nt recognise the success anymore .sucess is something usual .so the feeling of having success has to be found in a new way .this is especially the new risk which has to be taken .in conclusion , in my point of view successful people do nt have any fear by trying new things .they even need to risk something new otherwise they would get bored after some time doing the same .
