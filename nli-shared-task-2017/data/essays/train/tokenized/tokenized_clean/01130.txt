i believe that is more important for students to learn fact in a real way , rather than learn only knowledge .an example to support this idea is the comparison between university skills and work experiences .if a student learns about something practical it will be helped in the all day life and in the work life .on the contrary learning only concepts and ideas at the university is less useful in the real life .the experience that a person can achieve during a period of work , it s something that you ca nt learn everywhere .throughout the education , students ( for what concern the italian system ) do nt achieve as many practical things as they can bring from a business environment .for example i had a work period during the summer vacations in a marketing office of an international company , here i applied all my knowledge in the area .in this company i learnt practical marketing techniques that my university professors have never thaught to me .then , when i came back to the university and the marketing professor give us a task on how to develop the brand image of a business , i was ready and with many skills on this field .a thing that universities should do , it is to develop a better program of activities that students should be obliged to undertake .for instance providing working period in a business , whether the university department is business and management ; field trip at caves , lakes or mountain in the geology university and so on .in the real life learning practical issues is a very important part of people lives .if a student practice his skills since he is in the early education , when he will enter the world of work he could be more prepared to struggle with the competion .therefore he could have a good curriculum in comparison with people that don-t have experience .
