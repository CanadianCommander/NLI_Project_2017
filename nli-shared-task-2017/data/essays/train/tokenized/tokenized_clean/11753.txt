i disagree with the statement and it is what i do nt like of the intruction system of my country .i m studing engeneering and i have to study a lot of things , a lot of ideas and concepts of difficult subjects .my professors only explain concepts difficult to understand and , important too , to remember for the exam .i see that there is something wrong because if i study very much for the exam and i barely remember a concept , two weeks before i ca nt remember that concept because i do nt undertand it or because i have nt a fact that can conduce me to remember the concept .i think if a professor tell a fact or a story to support a main concept or idea i can using that fact or story to remember and , most important , to understand it .i can say this because i had a professor of ecology and he was very different from others professors .he only spoke about facts of little animals to reach the main concept of their reasons to leave a place .or for example he explained a chinese problem with the women population .he told that a chinese man can be considered a man only when his son put him in the ground for his death .for this reason when a chinese man had a doughter he kills her because chinese government do nt want families of more than five persons , so the women decreased .with these examples i understand and i remember ecology things after three or four years .i think that is the best metod to explain complicated concepts too , and it is a funny and not hard way to understand and remember things of different subjects .
