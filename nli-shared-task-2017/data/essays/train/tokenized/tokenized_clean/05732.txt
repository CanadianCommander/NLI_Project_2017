there are two kinds of people around us in basics , successful ones and unsuccessful ones .there are a lot of reasons affecting the success or causing the unsuccess , we all aware of them .but when we search the lives of successful people , we generally face with some success stories .nearly all of these stories starts with a risk factor .but in my opinion i am against having too much risk in life .at this point i want to give a saying that i heard in my school life `` more about less or less about more  .when i am asked to choose one of them , i chose more about less part .because i believe that specializing on the area you are working will be the best and guaranteed way of being successful .when we think about our daily life we can see the examples supporting my idea .for example , think about two restaurants one is specialized on pizza , and the other has a lot of kinds plus pizza .and you want to eat pizza .most of the people around us will choose the pizza restaurant because the human logic states that `` they are experts on this job  .to be successfull i believe that person must be one of the bests in his/her area .but at this point i want to clerify something .what i mean here in text by success is not money , therefore rich people are not accepted as successful in my mind .my successful persondefinition is that `` someone who contributes much to society  .in order to earn big moneys it is true that you must have risks , but successful people , in my mind , are the ones who are really knows what to do and can see far future from today .in this way a person can react to the changes in society quickly and this can result in reactions that may make people think as if the person is taking risks .but the person knows the reasons and the result of the reaction very well so that he can see the success that other people can not see at that point .to sum up i want to ask a question ; living is risk by its own why to take more risks ?
