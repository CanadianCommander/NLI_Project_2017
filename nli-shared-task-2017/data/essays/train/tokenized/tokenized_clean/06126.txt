today , the new generation is not as sensitive as their parents .they hid after their childhood and escape from the responsibilities .i agree for the statement .young people do not give time to help to other people .i guess this situation comes because of only one thing .`` technology improvement  .technology refers so many areas .television , advertisements , music , i-pods , games and of course computers and chatting .young people prefer watching tv or playing a computer game to giving time to help their communities .they all friends do this as well .they spend so much time at their rooms and do not talk to theis parents as well .in school theis conversations with their friends are not about the community .in spite of the problems they share only the games and their online communications skills .internet is now widespread .it makes the distance closer .the young people find friends from other countries .they improve their foreign languages and they learnt the culture of the countries .they like chatting to unknown friends .on my opinion , the young people are not guilty but their parents .parents should be a leader for their children .they can coordinate and organize the times to play , to study or to meet the helpless people .sensitivity begins in childhood .sensitivity is teached only by parents ; not by teachers or friends .they can learn their children that the life consists of not only the music , friends , tv or chatting but also people , trees , ecology , and the world they ca nt imagine .technology is a great strength and opportinity but its necessary to learn how to use it .be sensitive and be awere of the community .spend time for them .
