i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i really think that travelling should be a personal experience .this way you can travel alone or with someone who share same interests .you can even travel with your loved one s and spend more personal and quality time .travelling is not always fun if it s layed out for you by the tour guide .travel should be adventerous and it can accomplished only if you travel with out a guide .you can have more adventures and stories to tell when you travel with out a guide since you can find out new ways of doing things .it gives a great boost on how you could achieve things which you might have never imagined .travel should be an experience not a reservation .it also provides some time to think about yourself and how you have acieved it .you dont have to time your travel and can spend time based on your interest .you can always take a break at any place you want , if you are tired or just love spending more time at a specific location which is not possible travelling in group with guides .travelling in a group has lot of disadvantages than advantages .first of all you are grouped with lot of people you are not even familiar with .even though its all layed out for you to make it easy , it really takes away the personal beauty of travel .your interests might not really match up with every one in the group .so you end up spending time where you really do nt like to be .so personally i would like to travel by myself rather than in a group led by a tour guide .and make the travel more peronal .
