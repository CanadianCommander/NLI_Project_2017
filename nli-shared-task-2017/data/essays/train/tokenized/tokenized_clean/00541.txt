i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of several reasons .in general , it is because that young people nowadays have so more much responsibilities than they did in the past .first , they are expected to achieve academic success .this means that middle school and high schoolers have tremendously pressure in school because they are expected to get straight as and do all the community works in hope to get into their ideal colleges .second , young people have tremendous peer pressure in school .this is true particularly as many of them strive to fit in by wearing the right clothes and using the right terms .thirdly , after finishing their education , which is generally expected to be a minimum of a bachelor s degree from a considerably respectable university or college , they are expected to find a job with decent amount of salaries .ideally , because of the way hollywood protraits the so-called `` american dream ,  they should be able to buy a big house , own a couple of nice cars , and start a family .thirdly , after getting their first jobs , they have to work day in and day out and at the same time deal with pressures of uncertainties in their future , including the possibilities that they might never be successful in their careers or could even lose their jobs .on the other hand , older people that retired from their works are much more at ease with their lives .first , they have a peace of mind because they have already done most of the challenging tasks in life , including school and work .second , their daily schedules are much simpler are less task-oriented .rather constantly worrying about getting done with the next thing to study for or attend to , they can just enjoy life and be without the pressure to keep up with a schedule .as going to museums , listening to concerts , taking a walk on the street , day dreaming , or reading simply for enjoyment are part of their daily activities , they can simply enjoy life for the beauty of its simplicity .
