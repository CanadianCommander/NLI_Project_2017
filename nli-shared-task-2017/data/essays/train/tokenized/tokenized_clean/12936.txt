i dont agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people .the given statement can be accepted only to the extent of physical strength .the older people can not do all aspects of work physicaly as actively as young people can do .but in other aspects they can be on par with people .before saying how let me categorise different types of enjoying life .it could be in terms of spirituality , philanthropy , through experience which comes along with age , perception of life etc .an older person can how to relieve from stress compare to an younger person which leads to hapiness or unhapiness in life .well i believe that an individual can enjoy his life only when he has peace .an older person can better deal the traumatic stiuations that every one faces in life than a younger person .the younger person enjoys his life mostly through matrliastic pursuit which is only temporary and not the real joy .but at the most an older person who swam accross the age of youth is more inclined towards spiritual bliss .he is more religious and he can see the path between him and the god and that is the real and true joy .what is so sick about among people is that they dont have time to enjoy different aspects of life like nature , literature and arts in their busy schedule of life of accademics and carrier .an yong person may not experience the same quality of joy as an older person can while jogging or listening to music or showing concern and understanding people come to them .what iiwant to conclude is that the definitio for enjoyment may not be same for all .each individual can enjoy life according to the way he perceive it .so i dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
