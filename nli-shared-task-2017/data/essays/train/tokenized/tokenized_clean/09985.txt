some people agree to the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning concepts .others think learning facts should come first .in terms of critical thinking , i have to say understanding ideas and concepts is more helpful and worthy than learning facts .based on the field of study , facts are playing a important role .for instance , if you are a biology student you should know all the terminologies related to the human body in order to explore further topics .in art , knowing the differences of realism and classicism is the foundation of your knowledge .then , you can classify genres and styles of movies .however , students will not be able to develop critical thinking unless they understand ideas and concepts if they know about only facts .for example , with a scientific fact is presented in class and no discussion or analyzation is followed to help students understand the concepts , once students understand the ideas why a certain history event had happened in the past , it would be easy for them to understand the consequenses of that event .in conclusion , both understanding ideas and concepts ant learning facts are critical in learning .
