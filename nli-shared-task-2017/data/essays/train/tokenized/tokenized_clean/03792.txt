broad knowledge of many academic subjects than one specific subject is a wonderful thing to have .it is every man s dream but i totally disagree .the ability to memorize things is a gift from god , and it differs from one person to another .only a small percentage of people in the world are capable of memorizing information of multiple academic subjects with ease , the others who are the majority ca nt do that easially instead they work harder and read for longer hours trying to compensate for the lack of this ability .in the other hand the majority of people are capable of focusing or specializing in one specific subject which is again not an easy task to do but still without doupt much easier than broad knowledge of many subjects .broad knowledg of multiple subjects has many disadvantages , apart from being difficult , chances to forget things , make mistakes or confuse one thing to another are very high compared to specific subject knowledge .in the other hand , specific knowledge is easy to maintain , low chances of error and perfection is easy to achieve .i admit that specific knowledge has some disadvantages too , like being boring sometimes and if you do a mistake you will be badly blamed .in the end , choosing between the two kinds of knowledge depends on the person s capability and interest .both are really good and helpful to the world we are living in .but i am sure that i am not capable of general knowledge and i d rather to sepcialize in one specific subject .
