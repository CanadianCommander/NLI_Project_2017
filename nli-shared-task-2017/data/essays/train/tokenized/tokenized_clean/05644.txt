`` do anything as if it were your last and up to the point of perfection .i firmly beleive in the statement but i do nt really beleive that only by trying new things and taking risks a person can be successful .you can reach the zenith even if you are doing what you know how to do well with sheer hardwork and perserverence .behind every spectacular event lies unspectacular preparations .i would rather like to work hard on my assets and plans to excel them other than trying something new and exciting which has the probability that i might not like it .the roots of success lies in the will to exceed in life and a continuacy to a purpose .i loved helping people , dealing with the children so pursued teaching .i think if i continue my same profession of teaching i would be more successful other than trying a new thing all together like nursing .if i continue to teach , i have an enriched experience in the field of teaching and later on i can also apply for the position of a principal .but if i change my field to nursing i have to learn all about medicines and have to start from the very scratch .secondly i think a person gets a lot of satisfaction if he or she is doing something they already know .it gives a sense of self content and hapiness after that hardwork .if i offer to cook anything for my friend but i do nt really know how to cook , i might have an unpleasing experience after that chore because that dish might not be very tasty .so instead of taking any risk i would rather do something i enjoy and know how to do well .and i do nt think if i wo nt try that i am unsucessful .instead i know how how to avoid ruining my day and how to get the most of it .when you are doing something you already know you develop the sense of perfection and there are more chances to excel in that field .well in the end life is a tin of sardines and we are all looking for thye key .so sometimes we might have to try new things but my main chore would always be what i like doing the best .
