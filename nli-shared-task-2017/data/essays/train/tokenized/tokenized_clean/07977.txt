the question which is discussed in the following passage is wheter a broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects is superior to knowledge specialiesed in on specific subject .the idea to specialize in one activity is supported by the economic theory .the idea behind this theory is that the efficiency increases as we specialize in doing something .for example if we start playing an instrument we are getting better and beter the more we practice .the more we do something the better we can do it and the better we know which way it is done best .this theory can also be applied to education .a student who studied a subject longer and more intense than another is likely to know more about it .on the other hands side , there are also many advantages in having a broad knowledge .everything that happens , no matter if it is a ecological , sociological or another issue is somehow linked to other academic field .a broad knowledge helps to see an issue in the whole context which is in my opinon very important .if you are running a business for example , it is important to be aware of the ecological effects you cause .if you would just concentrate on the economic side of this business and neglect other factors this could drawback on you in the future .for example think of fishermen who want to increase their profit by fishing more in one year .this behaviour could cause that in the following years there are to few fishes .another advantage i see , is that it is easier to communicate with other people if you have some idea of his main interest .a broad knowledge can also be an inspiration .you can adapt ideas from other subjects .i personally prefer a broad knowledge because i like to undestand many aspects of one problem .i see a lot of chances in it because of the interaction between the different subject .but i also undestand if someone prefers to focus on on subject .
