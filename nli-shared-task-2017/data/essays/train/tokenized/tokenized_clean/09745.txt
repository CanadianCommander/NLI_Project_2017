today , there is a competition in every area and the one who is succesful is gaining it .succes comes from different ways .someone gets it by trying new things and taking risks and someones do the things that are experinced before .i thing the curiosity is sometimes good .when you try the new thigs that noone did , you may invent someting .for example , i am a biology student and i want to do some projects about genetics .in this area there is a pcr machine which incereas the numbers of the gens .if i work on the prensibe of how machine is working , i will never find new things .because it is allready known .however i want to study about the real-time pcr which is not obviously known .by this way , i am choosing the risky way rather than doing common things .i might study too much but noone can say that i will not invent a new thing .if i manage it , i woul make a big succes .so it is sometimes required to take a risk for being succesful .because it is not real succes to get the others experinced .
