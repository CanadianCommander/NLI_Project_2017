i agree with these statement and i will support my point of view through three different arguments : the fact that our cities in the near future will be saturated , the need for living organisms to have a clean atmosphere , and the problem of finding energy to fuel the cars .to begin with , it is precise to note that these days a car owning a car in developed and developing countris is becoming easy .the car dealers present the costumers with many financing options .these options and the present day necesities are incentives for poeple to own cars .the fact that many people are owning cars presents a problem of saturation in cities and makes it hard for people to effectively transport .furthermore , the fact that many cars are being produced and put in circulation present a mejor problem to our atmosphere .the fuel used by these cars produce polutants that are harmfull to living creatures on the planet .soon , in my opinion , government in developing and developed countries will begin to make laws in order to make it more difficult to own cars .many countries have developed efficient public transportation as an alternative .finally , it is imperative to be aware that manking is rapidly using up the available natural sources of energy such as natural gas and crude oil , the basic elements from which the fuel car fuel or gasoline is derived .finding alternative sourses of enrgy are costly and not always as efficient .by reducing the amount of cars in circulation , mankind may save these natural sources of energy making them last longer .today many developing and developed countries in europe , asia , and the americas are making available other means of efficient transportation like rail systems , metro lines , buses , and tramways that may be used collectively to reduce the amount of cars in circulation and as an alternative to people who can not afford cars .
