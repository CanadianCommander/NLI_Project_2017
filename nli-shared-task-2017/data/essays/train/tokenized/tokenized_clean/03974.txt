i disagree with the statement that students to understand facts rather than ideas and concepts tthere are two reasons for this statements : time and knowridge .the first reason why it is more important to students to learn facts lather than ideas and concepts is that they can learn wide variety of knowridge .this way students get more knowridge .the second reason why it is more veneficial to students to learn facts lather than ideas and statement is time .students can use the time more usefull .if student understand ideas and concept for each facts , they have to spend so much time and energy .for instance , when i was elementary school , i learned mathmatics formura without concept .in order to remember all the formuras , the teacher gave us a song for the formura .thus , we can easily remember this formura without spent exstra enersy and time. , and it is still usefull to me .i disagree with the statement that students to understand ideas and concepts than facts , because students to can use time usefull and get more knowridge .
