young people and older people enjoy their life in different ways .some people think that young people enjoy life more than adults , however other people think the opposite .i will discuss both points of views and finally give my opinion .young people enjoy their life in several ways .children have fun playing with their toys , they can spend hours playing with them and they do not get bored .teenagers like to go out with their friends and also to go to parties .for example , as a teenager i like to go to the beach with my friends and go to discos and pubs .young people also enjoy life when they reach a goal .for instance , i felt really happy when i won the first place with my friends in a rugby competition .children also enjoy and feel happy when they know someone protects them and give them love .older people have fun and enjoy life in many ways .adults feel happy when they reach a goal or they get something important .for example , when my father was hired in a very good company in my country he was really glad and i noticed he was enjoying it .other way to have fun is travelling , most adults like to travel and meet other people .for instance , my mother is a person who likes to travel a lot and i always go with her , i enjoy it too but i know thats the way my mother enjoys her life .something that is very common is that adults lay on their beds and watch television and they seem to enjoy it , even though some people find it boring .in conclusion , i think that younger people enjoys life more because there are more moments of happiness while they are children and teenagers .they have fun in easier ways than older people .therefore , in my point of view , children and teenagers enjoy more their life .
