yes , i definitely agree with this statement that young people nowadays dont give enough time to helping their communities .in this modern world , younsters seem to be too engrossed with their work .they are really striving for success .but while doing so , they forget their moral responsibilities and duties .the older people really care about the society .most of them are philanthropists and are concerned about the development .they offer their help , wherever they can for the upliftment of their community .for example , in a locality , if there is a major power failure and the locality is plunged into darkness , it ll always be the older people who will report this problem to the concerned authority .the younger people feel that they have better things to do in life , rather than performing acts of altruism .such kind of an attitude should be done away with .they youth should realize that the future of the society is their hands .words like ethics , priniciples seem to have died out in todays s world .take for example , a student studying in high school .he is doing really well in his studies and scoring high grades in all of the subjects which are being taught to him .but besides this , he should also offer some help to his community .he can do this by helping the weaker students out with their academics .also , he should think about the students living in the sub urbs who can not afford to go to school .he should be inspired by this very famous saying `` each one teach one  .hence he should take the initiative and rise to the occassion .he can offer help by taking lectures there , because education is the pillar of the nation .social service should be an integral part in everone s life .therefore , i feel that its high time , that youngsters start contributing to the communities by offering their help in whichever field they can .be it in schools , hospitals or offices .they should set an example for the generations to follow , by being benevolent and therby make this place a better place to live .
