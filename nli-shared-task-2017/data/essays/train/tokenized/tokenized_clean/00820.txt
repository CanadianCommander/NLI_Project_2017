almost everybody hate changes .a lot of people want to stay where they are because they believe they are satisfied with what they have and are doing right now .however many cases in the history have shown us that the people with open mind and people who are not afraid of new things have always defeated old styled and conventional people .these are fews things why the people who try new things and risk their position win in the end .most importantly , your environment doe nt always stay the same .the society keeps on changing .sometimes it is changed by the creative inventions like cars or the internet .successful people always sensed this change in the society and seized the chance .for example , who could have thought that everybody would have personal computers in almost every house about 30 years ago ?however , bill gates knew the world would change .he took the risk of dropping out of school and establishing his own company that produce software and finally achieved success .secondly , nobody knows what they are really good at or are interested in until they try new things .taking the chance to really find your talents is important .successful people have nt always been successful .after many failure , they finally found their talent and could at last be successful .some might be doing all right because they have been doing the same kind of job over and over again .however , if they just tried something more , they could have found their talent and be more successful .one should nt always fear failing and taking the risk .when you fall down , you could always stand up and run for the success all over again .when you just do what you are currently doing and never seize the chance , you might earn your living .however , to succeed , i strongly think that one should always look for new things .
