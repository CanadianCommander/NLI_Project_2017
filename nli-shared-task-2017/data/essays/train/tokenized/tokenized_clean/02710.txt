in the morden , some parents or teachers ignored student s ideai .however , i do nt understand why are they disturb the student s idea .i agreed that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .firstly , they have to see the world more wider and higher than before .later he or she have a very various ideas and concepts like tomas edison .if some parents expect to some child s opinon , they will learn very specific ideas , they can contribute in society or polictics in the world .seconly , if parent or teacher have to expect , the student can expect their parent or they can help their parnets .for example , there is a very strange a boy .he always want to make something , so their parnents expect him to make a lot of ideas .after 10 years , he became a very good inventor , .and graduated a very good university , also , he have to reply to his parent to make comfortable invention .lastly , we can make a lot of story when we are taking care of children and they would nt believe anything .most of children want to know curious something such as batman , superman and santa clause .if they did nt know the fact thet are shock their belief , and they would not believe anything later .we need to expect them continoulsy .the society is more complex , and thought of student is more complex , too .today is changing is very busy , and students want to rest something .some stuednts are retireing continously .if parents or teacher expect them first , students also try to expect them , too .student s idea and concepts is very important in this society , also student make to use their thought what ar they want we know that .
