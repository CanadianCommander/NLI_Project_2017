i agree wtith this opinion that successful people try new thiungs and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .there are several reasons .in my case , my mother is a succsessful person .however i always think many thingshappened in daily life negatively .for example , now i am in canada to study english .however i had a complain about my class .one of my reasons was that class was so noisy .many peolpe always speak a lot and i could not consentrate at all .then i discussed with my adviser , mythla .she told me that i will change the class that is more higher level .however i did not have a confidence if i can do well in this level .after school .i told all story to my mother .then she gave me an advice .she told me the story thet she experienced .the story was whar she went to skiing with her friends .and her advioce was that if you go to skiing with friend who has same skill with me , you can enjoy but your skill will not improved .however if you skiing with friend who has better skill than me , then your skill is more improve .i agreed with her advice .i think the person who doing what they already know how to do well does not take risk but they will not receive anything instead of their safty .if i will skiing with my friends , for me it is big challenge but i can learn from my fail .and , perhops i will try to do that i will never happen again .everybody have a bad experience .however we can get many advice from it .therefore i think successful people is the person who do not afraid of fail and keep challenge to get new things .
