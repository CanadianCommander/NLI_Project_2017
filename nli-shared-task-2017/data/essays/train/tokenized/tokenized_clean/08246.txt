knowledge is important .we all know it .nowadays , having a culture is needed to get a work .it is surely not enough , but it is the first step to success .the problem is wheter specializing or not .surely we have being seeing , in the past years , that employment market made many steps to specialization .but , considering how fast competence gets old , we should take the decision carefully .first of all , we have to say that a strong and various knowledge may help you a lot .knowing a bit of everything , or ecclectism , enables you with the so called flexibility , that at this time is truly imoprtant .when you know a bit of everything , when facing a decision , you may have at least a little idea about where you are going .not a clear one , though , but you cane figure it .this may be false if you have focused only on a subject .you have reached the cutting edge of it but you completely lack in other things .if you are in a statical environment , maybe you wo nt ever have any concern .but there is always some risk .i think we all should know about as much subjects as possible .the most that you know , the most you can choose .in fact , once you have tried a bit of everything , you can avoid things you dislike .furthermore , you can more likely avoid to choose blindly , because is well known that risks get bigger when you lack of informations .finally , once you have chosen your way , who blocks you from specializing on that subject ?training and training , your experience will yeld , but your eclectical knowledge will remain .so , at the end , yuo may reach the same level of the ones who have chosen specialization .but you will have more of them .
