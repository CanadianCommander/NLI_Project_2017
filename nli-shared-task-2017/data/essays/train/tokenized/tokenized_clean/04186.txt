there are many successful people around the world now and if we want to be a successful person , we can learn some things from them .i agree with this statement which is `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .i think my father is a successful person because he is a good sample for me all the time .he is a doctor in taiwan and when he was still a kid , he likes to try new things and always interested in the thing that he does not know .my grandmother told me a lot of his stories when he is young .and when he studied in high school , he already knew that he wants to be a doctor in the future .he always got good marks on the test or homework so he did not worried about these things .he started to go to some hostipal and see what s going on in a real place not just in school .he thinks this would be useful when he actually work in a hospital .after he graduated , he started to learn how to be a doctor and it was much more difficult than study in school .he try many nre things such as helping the patiens .they only did some practices in the school but not for real patiens so it is very hard for him at the first time .but after many years , he can controls everything in his hospital now .my father is a good example because he keep continue to learn new things after he graduated and also take risks .if he only did what he already know in the school , he can not be a successful doctor in the hospital now .therefore i agree with this statement .
