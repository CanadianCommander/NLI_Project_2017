when you study , there are mainly two ways of studying ; understanding ideas and concepts , and learnimg facts .in this essay , i would like to respond to the statement ; it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .but before i start judjing the statement , i would like to raise advantages and disadvantages of two ways of learning .firstly , i would like to raise advantages of studying ideas and concepts .the first advantage is that if you understant an idea or a concept , you can solve more difficult and complex problems using your understanding .it means you can use your knowledge in variety of situations and it is definitely a good thing .the second advantage is that it is interesting to learn an idea or a concept .most people feel satisfaction or feel happy when they understand new things .an idea or a concept is sometimes difficult to understantd but it is more enjoyable to study than just memorising facts .i fpeople feel happy to study , thei r motivation toward the study goes up .one advantage of understanding concepts and ideas is that iunderstanding concepts is much more difficult than learning facts .so people could stop trying to understand concepts before they succeed to .now i want to raise advantages of learning facts .the first advantage is that it is easy to remenber facts .you do not have to understandwhat you are memorising about ; everyone can do it .people could be confident if they succeed to memorise facts ; it stimulates their interests in what they are studying .the second advantage is that since facts do not depend on one  s feeling , facts are universal .there is no communication gap between facts .therefore if you learn facts , you can show off your knowledge to people who do not speak your language .however there are also disadvantages for learning facts .one disadvantage can be raised and it is that you are not understanding concepts behind the facts .if you do not understand concepts , you can not use your knowledge in a different situation .i strongly agree with the statement which says it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ; yet as described in this essay , it is also important to learn facts .the best way of studying is to combine both ways of studying .however if a student is only allowed to choose one of the two ways , i strongly recommend to focus on understanding concepts and ideas rather than learning facts .
