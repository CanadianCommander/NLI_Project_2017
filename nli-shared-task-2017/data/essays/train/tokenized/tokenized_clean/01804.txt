i agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .an article in a german magazine said , that today we live in a world of interships .whenever you have free time , you have to spend it sensible , which means by spending it in a way , that it looks good on your curriculum vitae .working in your community , helping old people for example , might look good on your cv because by that you can show your social skills .but if that community work is senseless for your further professional life , you will not do it bacause there is no use for you .that is how it works today .everything you do has to have a sense for your own future .so if you want to proof your social skills , you would probably prefer picking out an internship or any other service , that is more linked with your future working goal .one reason for this way of deciding , what to do , is competition .in my opinion we live in a world of competition .not only in school or university , everyone is competing , whether it concerns your schoolmarks or your ability to make new friends .everything is a question of competition .if you plan to work in your community in the future , helping your community is a possibility of raising your chance of getting a job later .but because of competing against everybody around you , it is kind of out of fashion just to help somewhere out without getting a piece of paper , that says what you have done .maybe there are some people , who help their community without expecting to get a document afterwards but i think , this might only be few .further there might be persons who would like to hepl , but do not have the time to do so because of their professional life for example .helping in fact means , doing something without a reward .nobody i know has the time left to do something without getting a reward .so i guess there are quite a lot of different reasons , wheather it is their profession , their goals or their opinion by not wanting to help their community because people think , nobody would help them , there are not many people left who actually help their community .and i do not believe , that the number of people , who are willing to help will increase in the future .
