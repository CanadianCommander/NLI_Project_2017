i agree with this opinioan .i think that to understand ideas are very important for a lot of studen .because of these , one thing , usually sutudent need to understand ideas , and the student should care a own skill .when i was in high scohol and junyor high scohol student , and then to understand ideas were important for me .because of this , when i was in the my class , i sometimes did not understand some classes , such as english class , math class , art class .i did not understood when i took these class , and then i always though  what should i do ?or what can i do ?  because i did not understand what my teater said and what my teater told to me , so my each clasese  galade was too bad , so i was always nervous when i got a bad glade or i did not understand my teater telling to me .in additon , to understand ides can heip for in our life because if we can understan clealy when someone who speak or tell to us , we will be able to make more friendly or we will be able to know each another  opinion .for exmple , in the company , to understand ideas are important bacause when we are meeting or making new product , and then to understand ideas are important .because of this , we will be developed by someone s opnion , so to understand ideas are importan .why i tell the company exsample , reason of this , i think that student and businessman , worker are very simalr , so to understand ideas is important for a student and also businessman and worker .therfore , i think that to understan ideas are important for student .if i always care about to undersatnd ideas , i will be successful , and i will be better student .
