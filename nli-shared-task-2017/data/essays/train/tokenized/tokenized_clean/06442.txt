some people believe that there would be fewer cars in use in the near future than today .i personally think that there would be more cars in use than these days .first of all , people are looking for alternative fuel resources that would replace the petroleums , which is the major fuel source for cars .secondly , there would be better access to places , meaning better roades for cars .lastly , many third countries are developing and that would lead to more people being able to use the cars .first , these days , people are searching for alternative resources to petroleums .people use petroleums for many uses but especially for the fuel of cars .when people are looking for another fuel source for cars that would mean they would keeping on using the cars in the future .this shows that people would nt stop using the cars even in the future , meaning the number of cars in use would nt decrease in twenty years .second , the world is getting smaller , meaning access to places around the world is getting better .so many people are not able to travel around the world since flight ticket prices to other countries are extremely expensive .since people are trying to let people move around easily , the roads for cars would be developed and built to many places to the other countries in the world .there are many people who are willing to visit foreign countries , and in the near future there would be better roads for the cars .that would lead to increase in demands for cars .finally , the third and developing countries are rapidly growing .for example , china is growing to become one of the strongest countries in the world .many people in china do nt have cars due to the poverty they are going through , but the country , china , is growing by days and nights and is suprising so many other countries around the world .in the near future , more chinese would have and use cars to move around and china has the biggest population in the world .china is not the only developing country which would become a strong country soon .there are a lot of countries that are in similar situation like china .to conclude , the demand for cars and the use of cars would nt decrease in the near future , but increase instead .there are people who searching for alternative fuel source for cars .there would be better roads and better access to so many places in the world .lastly , there would be more people who could afford cars from many developing countries .therefore , it would be impossible for the number of cars in use to go down in twenty years .
