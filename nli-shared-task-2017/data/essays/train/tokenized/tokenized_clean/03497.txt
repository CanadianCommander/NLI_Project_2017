i m line wid the idea that young people enjoy their life more then their elders do .young people beleive that only a healthy mind can dwell in healthy body .youths have revolutionised the world of entertainment and serves to be the backbone of entertainment industry .young people are very energetic and enthusiastic .they do every thing , they undertake , with extra vigour and keen intrest .undoubtedly their physical state plays a major role in making them appropriate to enjoy life to its fullest .while ours elders lacks that zeal and enthusuasm beacause of their dotage and senility .jack , a graduate student from harvard university , has variety of hobbies ranging from taking part into adventorous river rafting , enrolling for mountain tracking to horese riding .playing football is his strength and chess being his meditation .he also does yogic exercises while in gymnasium .moreover indulging himself in sports helps to stay him fit , active and alert .and this thing had helped him substantially to achieve a sense of contentment at all the three fronts of his life , be it professional , personal or social .youths beleive that enjoying life could recede stress and pressure from their life .so they go to theatres to watch a latest movie , play various musical instruments , surf the internet to gather the information about latest happenings around the world , go for paraglyding , take part in adventurous sports and many more other sports and medium of entertainment that our elders could not even think of .it has been seen that a boy would be very excited and cheerful about his new bike and would take pleasure in admiring the beauty and latest technology , the bike has .on the contrary our elders are burdened because of their social and professional committments .they do not have enough time for relishing and savoring their lifestyle .so they may not enjoy goimg to a movie or a horse riding .they would prefer to live rather a calm an serene life without excitement .
