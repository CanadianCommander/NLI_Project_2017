students should rely in factsand not conceptsafter i graduated from high school , my physics teacher taught me all kind of concepts for algorythms and formulas .later , at the university , when i was doing my internship , i look back and asked myself .why i did not learned more didactic and practical things ?facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life .concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life .actions demostrate ten times more than a single concept .a good idea is the one that it is made a reality .for example , let s imagine that i am an engineer and i only know the concept to operate a machine .can you imagine ?what am i going to do when i will be in front of my boss and tell him , `` i only know the concepts .it is ridiculous , to learn something without a logical meaning .facts are the physical prove of a hypothesis or a project. a student can not learn just an idea , they need to know how to develop the concept .in particular when i was working in a manufacturing industry , we had to give our client his product .we could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it .thus , it is important to be awarness of what a student is learning becuase if he does not , it is only an a waste of time .a student has to consider the facts instead of the ideas becuase it is the only way for the student to understand the purpose of a lesson .in particular , i enjoy taking classes at secap because they give a few theorical classes and the rest is useful practice which will help me in my career .it is clear , then that the ideas are just a vague imaginary actions that should be put into action .hence , students and myself have to rely on the facts of every lesson , for those are the ones that really matter in our life and society .between an idea and action , there is a process to work on .
