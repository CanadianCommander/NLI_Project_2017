education is understanding as well as learning .in my opinioun it is important for students to learn facts and at the same time also understand ideas .it depends upon the situations and experiences .understanding ideas and concepts is important so as to hnow how things could be .for example , a concept of driving or like traveling faster to a place gives us the idea of a car .it tells us to use a car for traveling .but for travelling a car we have to also need to consider the fuel to be used for it , the cost of driving etc .hence the students need to relate their ideas with facts needed for it .ideas are more imaginery while facts are practical .but if we dont imagine or think how can we make things happen ?but to make a practical thing happen we need to learn certain facts that are necessary to realise the ideas .for instance , a student thinks to make a garment .it is firstly important for him to have an idea of what kind of garment does s/he wants to make .s/he must decide the look of the garment like the colour , the lenght , size etc .but this is not over .to make the garment s/he has to know the fact that this will need a fabric to make it , a pair of scissors to cut it and then to sew the garment .hence a final product can be made .therefore the students do need to understand the ideas and concepts but at the same time also learn facts to realise thier ideas .only understanding and conceptualising ideas is not enough for a real thing to be made .a practical knowledge is also required for a student to be successful in his life .hence i think a student should give importance to both , understanding ideas and also learning the practicality of life .
