maybe right maybe wrong but i m not looking to this topic so dark . .because i m also young person but i dont think i m not giving time to help my community . .or at the topic what it s trying to be asked by helping ??what i see in turkey is mostly young people study in universities just for studying .few of them are really studying to be something or to make something for their community or for thier country . .but in other way not only the young people is the one to blame !so many university graduated youngs are still ca nt find a place to work in turkey . .in turkey i say because this is only what i can see . .i do nt know if it is thesame in other places . .but for sure this is being happening in turkey and i m really afraid . .in such small towns still small girls are being saled for money !and so many of them ca nt even go to scool . .so how can we wait from them somethigs to help thier community when they grow up . .they could nt save their selves . ..what is important first is to prove the parents ; the fathers , the mothers and also the brothers . ..first we have to blame ourselves before asking to agree or disagree about what youngs make for their community . ..lets ask this way then ; thus community gives enough time to help young people ? ...so last thing to say is ofcourse i do not agree this . .i wish it to see young people spending so much time to their community but i do not agree also what world or life giving to them . ..
