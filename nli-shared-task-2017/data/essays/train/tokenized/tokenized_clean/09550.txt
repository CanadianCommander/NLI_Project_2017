i strongly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .while the facts can be basis of analysing and developing ideas , it is more valuable to learn abstruct ideas for students .there are two reasons to support this arguments .one is the applicability of concepts , and the other is values of the learning process of ideas .firstly , ideas and concepts can stay in students memory and apply in different situation .in contrust , facts are fixed and forgetable .for example , i used to learn history in the facts based method and memorised historical events and peopls in details , but after several years i forgot everything which i learned .if i had chance to think about the reasons or possible solution of the historical events in my head , it would be applicable in my own situation .secondary , the process of learning about ideas and concept is the effective way of learning rather than memorising facts .in this process , students try to understant difficult things and ask themselves critically .this is very important part of learning and it makes students more intelligent .in conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts are more significant in the process of learning .
