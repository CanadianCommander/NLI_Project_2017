that is a difficult question because i think it belongs to different communities .in some regions i would agree with that statement because there are political problems that helps to let the problem grow .there you find children who grow up without a father or a mother and no one who cares about the young child .i understand that these children have no interest to help their communities when they are older because no one helped them .otherwise it could be that especially that people search in communities for help and if they find some they are pleased to help the community if the help is needed .furthermore often you find good conditions in wealthy regions .why ?i think they have not that problems like people who have to work hard for every little thing .these people live through the day without thinking how they survive tomorrow .in my eyes young peolpe spent a lot of time to help there community .please do not missunderstand me .but i think if people have not that all day problems , they are able to spent more time in helping there community of course .furthermore there is an other problem .the television shows how the young people have to live today .an there you see often that the children or young people work alone or spent more time with other thinks as to help their communities .on one hand our community wants that we are succesfull in what we make and often that is only possible if we do that alone and if we spent a lot of time for that but on the other hand the community sais that we have to spent our time for them .i think that is not possible .each person has to think about what for him is importent an where he wants to focus on .if both directions are equal you have the best way to success in that community .conclutioned i want to say that every person has to find his own way and especially the young people because they grow into that community with their choice .
