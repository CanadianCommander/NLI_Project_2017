most advertisements make products seem better than they really are , i am agree this stamente .in my expericences , i bouth products that seem to be --- really good , but threre not , the kind the publicity seems to looks to good , .one example the this is the hambuger , when they advertice looks so delicios , and when you tested is not to good .one another exaples is the car the advertise with a lot --- speeds this right , but you can not use this speed in the regular time , for my is better when adverse about the gas .an another examples the services advertise , sometimes you went to companies to have a services , and you not have the quality the services that you pay .in conclusion the advertisements play a big situation to sell products in the market .
