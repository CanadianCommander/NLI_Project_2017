this statement is highly hypothetic .how can we predict that situation ?however the situation today is obvious : we will have to go through one of the major shift of our society .even today , the crisis is so imminent and at the global scale .experts says that the world will run out of oil in 30 or 50 years .considering that our economy is completly based on this source of energy , it is easy to predict at least a change of habits from ourselves , and why ca nt we start by reducing the number of cars in our streets .that is fairly one of the decision we must take quickly , so i have to say i am really convinced that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .in addition to that , we can observe a real implication of the governments lately , wich can be found for example in the endeavour of many western countries to develop a large public transportation network .i really believe it s a decision that can reduce the number of cars , at least in the western countries .indeed , in opposite , we can see how much the car market grow in the third world countriesnevertheless , as we live in a world where the technology goes faster and faster , perhaps the solution will be less radical .indeed , in our days there are already many sources of energy are to be foud to replace fuel .for example , some scientists have achieved to create a cereal oil that can replace completly petrol .it is in use in brasil where the fuel is mixed with 15 % of cereal oil .it is clearly a great step forward , a step that can prevent the car to disappear totally of our way of life .
