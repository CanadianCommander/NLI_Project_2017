to study several academic subjects in the university is not bad at all .her , the students will learn and discover many facts and information about many things in the life .now thay may learn about things that they never though about which-in my opinion-will add to thier knowledge alot .there are many studies done recently to know if other subjects being taken by the students outside their specialized area may upgrade their general scors in the exams and improve their understanding in the general scinces .it was found that those students who took several subjects outside their specialized area they do better in their final exams .however , we should not be very opitimistic about this .there are still many academic researches belive the opposit .some of them think-from their experince - that taking subjects from outside the specialized area bring undesired effects .it was reported that some students who took subjects that are directly related to their sepciliaty are not giveing enough attention to their major courses and actualy they are not concentrating and , therfore , they waste their time and above all extra subjects add nothinhg to their knowledge .moreover , some academic principles are currently revising this issue in the universities and trying to come to a sort of strategy whether to keep the doors open for any student to take broaden his/her knowledge or put some restrictions on it .in my opinion , if the students take what ewver subject outside his/her speciality this wo nt bring bad at any how .in fact this will increase the the general information about many thing in the life .in conclusion - and based on my own experince - students should be always encouraged to take subjects from in and outside their area of speciality , but i also feel that more studies should be conducted to know the exact effect of taking many subjects on the final perfomance and knowledge of the student .
