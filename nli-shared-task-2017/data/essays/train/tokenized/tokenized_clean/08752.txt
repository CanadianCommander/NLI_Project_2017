in a modern society , people always face the dilemma of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than having specialized knowledge in one specific subject .this question is such a much-debated one that it affects almost everyone in his or her daily life and deserves some close examinations .as far as i am concerned , i vote for the former , which means i do agree with this statement .among various reasons that support my choice stance is that having broad knowledge can make you more attractive , can provide more oppotunities for you career , and can make your life more interesting .basic to any understanding of reason preferring having broad knowledge is that it can make you more attractive .if you are knowledgeable in many academic subjects , you can share more information with your friends and people arrounding you .for instance , i have a friend who has deep understanding in many fields , such as history , mathematics , music , and even cooking .i like talking to him , because i can learn much from him .that s why , in my opinion , broad knowledge can make one attractive .moreover , having broad knowledge can provide more oppotunities for you career .you have more choices .a persuasive example is that one of classmates has got an exellent job besides her major .she has both strong knowledge in both industrial engineering , which is her major , and software designing .eventually , she got the job as a programmer , which provides a decent salary .we are all admire her now .therefore , if you have broad knowledge , you have more oppotunities for you career .furthermore , you can live better based on the broad knowledge .besides , the further reason , not the last , why argee with this statement is that it can make your life more interesting .in fact , my father is just the person who has broad knowledge .in his spare time , he play tennis , translate germany literatures , and design mechanical equipment .his life is colorful .as a proverb says , `` various knowledage can make a person rich .in today s world , having broad knowledge does give you incredible experiences and make you a rich mind person .it is obviously that only these three reasons can make everyone draw the conclusion that , not to mention there are more reasons that account for my propensity for it .in summary , from what we have discussed above , we can safely come to the conclusion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i agree with this statement .anyway , it is confined to me ; different persons may have different choices accroding to their own personalities and fondness .
