fewer cars , better livesin the past century , we witnessed many dramatic changes .the broad use of internet , the faster service of communication , and of course , the great change of transportation means .though car may be one of the most beneficial inventions in the last century , i still believe that in the following twenty years , its use will reduce .the greatest concern of all car owners may be the oil price .during the past decade , thousands of people suffered from the rapid growth of oil prices .it may cost you a lot to by a porshe , and may cost you much more to afford the energy it needs .i read in newspapers that more and more people transfered to use public transportation means rather than drive their cars to avoid this big expense .some chose car-pool instead .let s focus on our environment , say , the quality of the air .a lot of countries made new policies to deal with the air pollution caused by the use of cars .the implementation of these rules and regulations will promote the environmental protection , and because of this , those car owners whose car may be not qulified according to these rules , may decide not to drive it any longer .thus fewer cars may be in use in the future .last but not least , almost everyone has the experience of being caught in a trafic jam .this inconvenience may not only cause us to angry but also cause many other problems .what could you do if you need to do an important presentation to your boss but got yourself in the flood of cars ?or maybe you were late for a decisive negotiation because of the bad traffic ?i think this may be the reason for those multinational corperations to restrict their employees to drive their private cars .efficiency is everything .admittedly , cars have brought us many precious things .but we are enjoy less and less right now due to the excessive use of cars .i think and wish that we could enjoy a better life and be less dependent on cars .
