i do not agree with this statement , although i would be glad if it were true .in my opinion it is too idealistic to assume that the numbers of cars will decrease .it might be possible if a new technology were discovered and brought into use , or if several societes around the world learned to depend only on public transport .unfortunately , twenty years is not enough to come up with a completely new way of personal transport .there would have to be a phenomenal invention like a little individual airplane for everyone to replace the car .as i said , i do not regard this as possible .concerning the public transport , it would be necessary to reorganize whole cities or even countries in order to make the car a less practical means of transport .one could argue that because of the concern for the environment that people have they would not buy new cars anymore .especially because of the increasing pollution of the air .however , i think that the numbers of those who are really and honestly concerned about the future of our environment are too few .there are still those who do not care about pollution and who regard it as more important to be able to possess an individual car .a lot of people might have ideals of a cleaner and less polluted environment , but as soon as it comes to their personal comfort they are not ready to give away the car .another reason why there will not be fewer cars is , that the biggest part of the world s population consists of people from poor countries or countries that are now growing and increasig their wealth .it is most probable that in these countries the number of cars will increase immensely .for example china .more and more people gain money through commerce , people that before lived in poor conditions .these people will now be able to buy cars , so that in the end , the number of those who buy cars is by far bigger than of those who decide not to use them .
