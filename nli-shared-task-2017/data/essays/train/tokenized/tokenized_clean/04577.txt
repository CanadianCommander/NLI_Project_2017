in my opinion , it wo nt be an exaggeration that young people do not spend time on their community .it is true that young people seldom do things for their community .the reason is simple .young people have other things to do and ; most of all , few young people have the sense of community .seldom young people in my country are required to do anythings for their communities .they are often be told that they have to study hard .their reposibility is to focus on their study and their school work is always on the top of priority .to their `` consederate  parents , things like helping their communities is taken as an bother to their children .even the task is as easy as cleaning the sidewalk around the community , parents will usually choose to finish by themselves rather than getting their chidren involved in .on the other hand , few of young people nowadays have the sense of community .they even do nt know who their neighbor are .how can it possible to ask those indifferent people to pick the garbage scattering in the house next to their house .they usually think that their will solve the problems in the community because it is adult s bussiness .they are seldom be educated to help others .they claim that they are too young to have opinion and ability to making descions about their community .i do nt think that it is all the young people s faults that they pay little attention to their community .their parents should also be responsible to this situation .our younger shoud be taught to be more earnest to their living environment instead of caring only about themslves .
