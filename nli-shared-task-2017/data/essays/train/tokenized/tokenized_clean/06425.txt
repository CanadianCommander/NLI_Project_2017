i really agree with this opionion .what i study now is the technology of electricity .but what i should learn not only this thing .i should learn maths , physicals , computer and a lot of other things .at first , i do nt know why i should learn it , then i know it .if i was asked to figure out something about the power of electricity , i should use maths , and how the electricity move , i also need the knowledge about the power and other tings .sometimes i need some special computer programmes to figure it , then i should write these programmes by myself .the more borad knowledge of other academic subjects will help me the better in my specific subject .not only in my experiences , i also think almost all learners would agree it .beacuse nothing is exist in one theroty alone .here is a very simple example : when an apple fall dowe from the tree .this phenomone support on a lot of things .such as why it leave the tree , why it fall down , how fast it fall down . ..all these different questions need different subjects to answet it .and also , board knowledge of many academic subjects will help us see a question in different way .also there is a simple example : also there is an apple .it become smaller and lighter everyday .you cant find any reason of that in botantical or physical subjects .but you will know why if you have learned chemcial .beacuse the water cells in the apple get outside , so you can kown well why it become smaller and lighter everyday .everything in the world needs broad knowledges .the more we learned , the better we can kown the world .this is my opinion of board knowledge of many academic subjects .you will find interest in a lot of knowledge .
