there are three aspects of traveling involved in the statement .first , the best way to travel ; second , traveling in group and third , having a tour guide .i do not agree with the statement as a whole and i will explain with respect to each aspect of the statement that i pointed out above .the following are my reasons for my disagreement :i believe there is no one best way to travel .it is a very personal preference and differs from person to person .the best way to travel really depends on what kind of place are you going to tour , what is your objective of touring and what are your preferences .some people may enjoy company of a large number of people while traveling and some people may love to travel all alone and experiment during their travel .i do believe traveling in group leb by a tour guide can be very enjoyable but sometime traveling in group without a travel guide or traveling individually can also be enjoyable .traveling in group has it s own problems .there might be disagreements among group members and it may delay things .if my objective of touring is to learn and at the same time enjoy the company of my friends and family members than i would prefer to go in a group led by a tourist guide .tourist guides are familiar with the place and they can provide us the history of the place in a very short time and you may not have to put lots of efforts to know about the place .if my objective of touring is to explore new place , learn more about the place than having a tour guide may not serve the purpose .tour guide provides a snapshot of the history of the place .in this situation i would like to travel on my own and explore the place in my own style .to sum up , i would choose my traveling method depending on the situation and my personal objective .if i want to spend time with family members i would like to travel with my family members in a group and would like a tour guide to help us but if i want to explore and experiment with a new place i would prefer to travel alone so that i have independence and liberty to take my decisions and experiment .
