success does nt happen overnight , it takes lots of work and dedication .i believe that succesful people are risk taker .in this paper i will emphasized my opinion with three points : to be successful , people need to make mistake , to be successful people need to take risk , to be successful you people to explore and try new things .first successful people are not perfect , they learn from their mistake .by making mistake a person depens his experience .the person also open his mind to new ways of doing things .often when someone makes a mistakes he tries to not replicate the mistake later on .let s take as an example alexander graham bell , when he invented the telephone , he made lots of different adjustment some work some did nt .second , in order to make a mistake a person need to be willing to take risk .if no risks are ever taken there is not mistake that can occur .the same things happen over and over again .the person is in a cycle .going back to our example , mr. bell was deaf , how could he have invented a telephone ?do nt you need to hear to be able to speak through a telephone ?mr. bell took a risk in trying to invent abn object that he , himself , could not use .third taking risk also means that a person need to expore and try new things .by trying and exploring a person acquire experience and is more able to open his mind to new things .opening your mind is an important aspect of being succesful because it allows you to see and experience different point of view .mr. bell experience clearly show someone who had an open mind and was willing to try and explore new things otherwise he would not have tried to invent a phone but he might have tried to invent something he could have used to communicate as a deaf person .in conclusion , mr bell was a successful man because he was willing to make mistake , to take risk and to explore and try new things .mr bell did not just sit around and do what he already knew , he went ahead and was successful .so now what are you going to do ?sit around or jump into a successful life ?
