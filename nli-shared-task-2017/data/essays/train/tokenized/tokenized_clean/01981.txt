generally speaking i fully agree with the statement that students should focus on grasping the underlying bases of a concept than to know all facts by heart .my main reason for having that opinion is because today s strucure of information flow is fast and constantly changing .today there are masses of information available through new technologies e.g. via the internet .new findings are constantly published and replace information that has previously been accepted .therefore , to me it no longer makes sense for a student to memorize all facts by heart .it is rather necessary that basic knowledge about a studying field and related investigating methods are taught in schools and university .as stated above facts are subject to changes and revision but with a profound basic understanding students will be able to absorb new facts and integrate them in their knowledge of the world .this way they are able to successfully face challenges , that find solutions to problems that have not been addressed to yet .if one needs to refer to facts , students can look those up in lexicas or consult internet sources .these are the main points why i think it is crucial for students to have a basic understanding and how different topics are related to each other , to know aspect that they have in common and where they differ .it s more a net of knowledge .however this does not imply that fact knowledge is worthless and i can think of areas where it is crucial to have the information instantly available .to illustrate this thought one can think of a doctor in the emergency section in hospital .this is a situation where time is a limited recourse and seconds might decide whether a patient lives or dies .here the doctor should know all facts about medicine and consequences of action when treating the patient .the same is true for pilots and other critical professions .to sum it up as stated above a general understanding of a field is more important for students , considering later challenges in life , than to be able to recite information an failing to come to the core of an idea .however as the example of a doctor in the ambulance shows some basic information need to instantly accessible in situation when time is scarce .
