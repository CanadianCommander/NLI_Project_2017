` failure is the stepping stone of success  .success stands on four pillars .they are efforts , risk , determination and dedication .without these factors it can not be achieved .as a coin has two faces , even there are two faces to acheive success .one face of achieving success is by playing safe .look for the companies which have already flourished , became popular .obtain farchise of the company and open a new outlet .by doing this we can not only get out of risk but also make profits as early as possible .but we need to follow some prerequisites requested by the original company .the office and the organisational structure should resemble the original company .for example maruthi company taking the franchise of suziki company of japan .as they used the brand name of suzuki which was then the most reliable automobile in the world maruthi company bacame successful .they had introduced indias first small car maruthi suzuki 800 which has beaten all existing models then .thus it can be said that successful people can acieve success by not taking risk .adding to the above example , one more example can be quoted .let us take pizza hut .the company is located in the united states .the franchise has been taken to set up the same in india .within two years of time , in all metrpolitan cities branches have been opened and they are running successfully .so , we can say that franchise is one of the ways to achieve success without taking any risk .now the other face of achieving success is by taking risk .whenever we enter a new sector in businees arena to flourish risk must be taken .but there are people who were successful and there are people who couldnt not taste success .agressive marketting strategies , best quality products and customer satisfaction are the roots to achieve success in this arena .reliance industries tried to enter communications arena by introducing post pais mobile phones .they have given the cheapest prices in those times .their campaigning strategies were creative .people got attracted to their system .within few years reliance bacame the best mabile in india .one more example is the founder of hotmail mr.bhatia .he was the first person who introdued email to the world .he invested lot of money on his research and came up with fruitful results .had he not taken the risk of investing such a huge amount he would hvae not become successful .rightnow he is running in crores .he even expanded his business .hence i would like to be diplomatic with the given statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doin what they already know how to do well .
