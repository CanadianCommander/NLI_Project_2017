first of all , it s hard to say if there will be or if there wo nt be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .this issue has to be discussed , and both points of view have to be advocated through good and reliable arguments .on the one hand , i think that the number of cars will increase in the next two decades .indeed , there will be more people allowed to pass the driving license .everyday , the earth population is increasing so , it s mathematicly logical that there will be more cars in the next twenty years .furthemore , i think that there will be more automobiles because of , or should i say `` thanks to  , the development of tourism .along the years , people have used to use the cars for going on vacations for exemple .as well , the more the society is changing and evoluating , the more people can provide them with a car , this locomotion mean is no longer a good for rich people .as well , we live in a period where it has become natural to use our cars .nowadays , we take the car to go to the supermarket as well as to go to the butchery with is 500 meters far from our house .because of the development of the automobile industry , we have become completely lazy or , at least , we tend to become very lazy . ..on the other side , i think it s possible that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years : as a matter of fact , people are more concerned about the environment and we can see the emergence of new environmental organisations struggling against car pollution .furthemore , the governement might have planned to make downtown paris , a discrict where people will have to pay for entering it .in london , the congestion charge was implemented a couple of years ago and there is fewer cars and less pollution in the center of the british capital city , according to the environmentalists people .moreover , a lot of people take the commun transport to go to work , to go out at night so , why would this change ?a lot of inhabitants of paris have understood that it was more simple to move by the subway or bus instead of by car .my last arguments will be that the cost of oil will increase for sure . ..that will be prevent people for using their cars as they usually do !
