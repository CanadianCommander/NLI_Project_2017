i disagree with the idea of a society formed by selfish young people .it s not completely true .it depends on their family , their friends and their social background .indeed , if you lived in a family where your parents think only about themselves because they are concentrated only on their job , it would be difficult to think helping the communities .in this case , the son or the daughter usually thinks about her or his studies , toys , things , goods and not about the others who can need their help .if i lived in a different family where my parents have taught me to help other people and also animals , the matter would change .we can start also from our home and our daily routine .if i taught my son that it s important to help me doing something , he could do the same in other occasions when he is not at home .if my son stayed at home in front of tv all the day and i said nothing about that , it could be negative for his sense of help and responsabilities .so all begins from the education .the education to help someone is the basis .it does nt depend on young people but on their education .i have met in my life a lot of interesting young people who help every day their friends or people in need .they always belong to a catholic society or have many strong values such as family , love , friendship , sacrifice and so on .they always believe in something : god or politic values .or they believe in some utopistic theory such as communism .i never met generous and unselfish young people without strong values .so where young people are not interested to help their communities is where there is a lack of important values .i believe in some strong catholic values and i try in my free time to help other people in differrent ways .i m a teacher and i work in some cases without earning in order to help some poor people .there is another important point and it always depends on education : young people sometimes have too many hobbies and appointments in a day and so there is no time left for helping people .if a parent prohibited this kind of day routine , young people could be less busy and they could have more available time to help others in need .in conclusion , in the souls of young people , there is the desire to help the communities and the adults have to help them to do that .
