i did nt agree with the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first reason is that i think travel is a very personal experience and that does nt need many people come and finish with me .second reason is that the travel agency will bring me to a fixed place and fixed time to travel places that most people should look and that also means i ca nt have enough time to take adventures .third reason is that most of the tour guides really just provide limit and small information from the tour text books .i will provide more detail about my points .the first reason i did nt like to join a travel group is that i think travel is a very personal experience that is a process of dialuate with myself .i will enjoy the singal travel experience that i can read , stay with the local residents and sit down to write when i meet what touch my heart as my wish .the second reason is that the travel agencies always provide some limit places that cost them less money and limit the time for the travel spots .so i ca nt have some more adventures to deeper places , talk with more people , and take more detail on the place .that is very pity .more over , they will bring me to some boring shopping centers that are always waste my time .the third reason is the most important part to me that is the toup gides are nt local residents or they are just provide too little information to me .some even ca nt give me more information except from the tour gide text books .to my point of view , i did nt agree with the point that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .because travel means to me is more personal , more relax time to go and to touch the things and to understand more about where are the culture differences .so fixed time and fixed places way of travel group is not just not my choice .
