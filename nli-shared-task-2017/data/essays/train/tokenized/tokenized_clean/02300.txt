i agree that in twenty years , the number of cars in use shall go down .at first glance , this might appear absurd and strange , what with the rapid technological , social and economic growth everyday .however , on carefully analyzing and thinking about it , this claim actually makes sense .i shall try to elucidate on why i feel that there will be fewer cars after twenty years .the population of this world is increasing day by day .public places are often jam packed .traffic jams , accidents and so on are the order of the day .if this is the situation now , one can imagine the state of affairs after twenty years if things continue like this .think of any big city and unfortunately the first picture that comes to mind is of heavy traffic , lots of people and no space .because of the rapid development and technological advancement , one often says that ` the world has become smaller  .this statement sounds highly appealing in a figurative sense .but after all , the world is physically of a fixed size too !if the number of people and their cars keeps on going up , where will all of them be accomodated ?be it small cars or big cars , the pollution levels are at an all time high .the fumes from these cars result in lung related diseases and breathing problems .when the number of cars was small , these issues were often brushed under the carpet .however , now is the time to think of these things .at an age when we are facing the consequences of our actions , be it in terms of global warming or war , people need to realize that we should look for alternatives before it gets too late .community vehicles , car pooling , even bicycling ( for short distances ) often result in much less tension and effort in moving about today .with more efficient buses , metros and trains , people have started to realize that driving around in a car is becoming more of a nuisance than a convenience .there is also a growing concern about the limited petroleum resources in this world .the petrol , diesel and oil prices keep shooting up day by day .we need to find alternate modes of travel using renewable sources of energy like solar or wind .people are researching on solar cars or wind driven cars .with the scale of progress today , the open sky might also turn out to be a very viable option .if we can introduce cheaper air travel even between shorter distances , this will not only result in much faster travel but shall also help ` decongest  the earth .unfortunately today , people have become so lazy that even for short distances they prefer to drive rather than walk or cycle down .but people need to realize that this phenomenal growth in cars can not go on indefinately .people need to look for alternatives .i am hopeful that in twenty years , we would have shifted our focus from cars to public transport , non-petroleum based vehicles and perhaps even air travel .
