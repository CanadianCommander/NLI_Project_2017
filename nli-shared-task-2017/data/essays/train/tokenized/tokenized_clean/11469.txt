i have to say before entering this topic that we can not know what will happen in twenty years or even if cars will circulate around .but , if everything continious to progress as it has been doing for the last ten years i think that hopefully , there will be lots of cars but not as much as today .the reasons are that globalization is making us move around the globe more than ever before but also more quickly .another task to have in mind is that cities are expanding , and this makes it impossible for cars to succesfully attend the requirments of people in terms of transport .so , if we have to cover longer distances in a shorter period of time i think it will only be possible if public transports become more accesible to people , more confortable and , of course , more efficient .also for longer distances , air transport but speacially trains will bring the solution to the problem .trains are more confortable in terms of working experience ( for example with a laptop ) , reading , having meetings or conversations , than in planes where taking off and landing do not permit nearly anythything .of course between places where there is sea or ocean in between planes are the only option , and i also think that they will continue to imprive in many aspects .but returning to the city ( where by the way i have more experience ) , the rush hours are a complete waste of time .governments and private institutions need to promote public transports or for example taxi cabs .this transports have two main benefits .the first one is that people in charge of driving are not in a hurry so the will drive more carefully .also they will know the better way to follow and will transport more people in less space ( what does not necessary mean that you can not breath ) .the best example would be the metro ( or underground ) .cities like paris or ny need to invest in their metro services ( witch are old and smell really bad ) , but others like madrid have invested a lot in it and , not in twenty years but now , today , there are less cars than before .also cities where motorbikes and bikes are promoted experience a big fall in the number of cars .
