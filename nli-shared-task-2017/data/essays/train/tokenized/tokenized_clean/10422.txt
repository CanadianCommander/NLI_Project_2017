i have to disagree with the statement because of the numerous points that could be immediately come up with that contradice it .it is also prudent to consider the point which might disprove my stand , but it also will be falsified in the last paragraph .the first reason for more cars in twenty years is that the fuel that is necessary to run cars i.e. gasoline , is not going to run out any time soon .a common misconception is that the world s fuel supplies will dry up in fifty years to come .actually , there are huge deposits of oil in developing and under developed countries which are unexploited .there are also huge reserve deposits in developed countries , like the reserves in siberia and arctic sea regions of russia .with gasoline , the most convenient mode of transportation for people , atleast right now and probably for atleast twenty years to come , would be cars .secondly , the developing countries generally consider developed nations as role models in community , economic and industrial development .this , combined with the fact that most of the people in developed countries would want to drive their own cars , proves that the number of cars in developing countries would definitely increase .nowadays cars are introduced in a wide spectrum of models which appeals to all .apart from this , the technology and instruments to make cars are gtting cheaper which makes cars available to everyone .this can be supported by the fact that tata motors is on the verge of introduction of a car for just one lakh rupees in india .this would enable more people to buy cars .car sports like rallies and the world famous formula one make cars even more popular .not that anyone is going to buy a formula one for city use , but the craze is enough for some people to convince themselves to buy some of the meanest machines available .the famous computer game `` need for speed  is one example of media popularising cars .in the game , cars are available in the weirdest designs and can be customised .these ideas promote people to buy cars .the only reason which might contradict the theme of this passage is fuel costs .yes , they are going high .despite this , figures suggest that car numbers are increasin in the world .
