first , it is important to know the meaning of `` enjoying life  .is this entertainment in its pure form , only constituted of liberal pleasures such as going out , drinking or smoking , staying late up , eat a lot , have sex , or does it mean to find a meaning in life , develop as a human being , have a family and a spiritual life ?actually , i think enjoying life can take as many forms as possible , depending on the persons .thus , i do nt think it is a question of age .i think it s only a question of minding .some people are just in the right frame of mind to enjoy whatever opportunity life brings .an optimistic person will in general enjoy small things one after another , and face difficulties as a challenge .we all know a negative person , so self-centered on its own problems that he or she does nt see the beauty all around him or her .and is this a matter of age ?certainly not .but being in a positive minding does nt come in any condition .it is a matter of needs being fulfilled .a person whose basic food , lodging , reproductive and affective needs are fulfilled will be a lot more likely to enjoy life .health being a main issue in this case , older people may not enjoy life as much as healthy young people .but again , it is not a matter of age .as we grow older , our body does not support us as well as it did when we were young .it is common for old people to have health problems .therefore , anyone can be sick , even very young people .it is known that the poorest people on earth can be a lot happier than us , rich north-americans , for they are often part of very close human communities .by fulfilling completely their need of affection , they maybe need less than us , who have plenty of food and physical comfort , but suffer from an individualistic society where we are often left alone .
