most of us , at least once in our lives , were dissapointed by a brand-new product we had just bought after being seduced by a flashy advertisement .after learning the bitter truth that the product is not the least of what is presented in its advertisement , we understand that we were swindled by an advertisement .i agree with the fact that most of the time advertisements make the products seem much better than they actually are .the very simple and powerful trait of an advertisement is that the very reason of its existence is to make the product seem more appealing and attractive to the customer .the advertisers primarily aim to show the best properties of their product while hiding its weaknesses behind the curtains .for instance , while watching an advertisement about a video game to be released in the market , it is highly unlikely that you will hear anything about the possible dangers of the game such as provoking violence , especially on the target audience .in the advertisement , you will only see the beauties and improvements of this video game compared to prior ones , such as its graphical superiority , or development in its scenario etc . ..secondly , an advertisement will always try to impress the customer at first sight .the idea here is to create an illusion in the mind of the customer to convince him to purchase the product .i remember a very notable example for this .when i was 10 years old , i desperately wanted to have a bicycle since most of my friends possessed one .i remember very clearly that when i saw an ostentatious advertisement about a mountain bike , i fell for it .i repeated a million times to my father that i craved for that bicycle .after seeing the bicycle i remember my father being doubtful about purchasing it because it simply was nt the bicycle that we saw in the advertisement !without giving a second thought i went furious .and eventually my father bought that bicycle .using it for several months , when my passion faded away , i realized my mistake , but it was too late .last but not the least , the advertisements try to catch the customer by aiming to the subconscious .the advertisers study the minds of the customers , namely their target audience , to make them surrender to the idea that the product is absolutely necessary in their lives .they achieve this by using certain gestures , words or displays in advertisements to catch the customer without awakening his conscience .for example , an advertisement about a car might include a beautiful lady to imply that purchasing the car will also provide the charisma or respect required to impress the lady .the target audience here which consists of mainly males , will be impressed by the car without really acknowledging this trick .all in all , there are several ways for the vendors to make their products seem much better than they actually are .eventhough , this statement should not mean that all the products with impressive advertisements are exaggerated in their display , it is definitely true for most of the products because advertising simply means to make it seem attractive .
