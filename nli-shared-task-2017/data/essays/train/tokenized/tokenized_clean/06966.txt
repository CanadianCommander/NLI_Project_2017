i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first of all , the techniques used in advertisements such as color , use of cameras , background and a cheerful music create a more appealing atmosphere that induces people to buy that product .the advertising companies are very talented to make products look bigger or smaller with clever positioning of the cameras , depending on which of these two are merited .many products are purposefully portrayed differently to the consumers by advertisement tricks .many food items are dyed with a special food coloring that make them look incredibly delicious so much so that even the best cook in the world can not give them such a look .they even create a fairy tale around a product to make people believe in the qualities of the it .for instance , many products from cars to perfumes are presented with an appealing feminine figure as if the beauty of the model does indeed convey the beauty of the product .so women may buy a perfume not because it smells terrific but because it is used by a famous celebrity .the image or the fairy tale created around the product conceals the real quality of it and makes it irresistible .the use of famous people can even be very much disappointing for the real consumer because people usually ignore questioning the necessity of buying a product when they see a famous and loved figure using it .this phenomenon which could be called the `` the celebrity effect  is very much responsible for disappointed consumers in the long run .another factor that hides the real quality of products is the advertisement promotion .people start to use or consume products for their temporary benefits such as reduced fee for mobile phones for a limited campaign period but after that `` path dependence  is created among the consumers and people are used to using that product , all of the temporary benefits are removed .to conclude , advertisers are doing everything to create an image that does not quite exist , or exists only partially .i think the consumers should go and see the products in real life to make the ultimate decision .
