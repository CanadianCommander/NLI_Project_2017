i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .firstly , we have a large number of charities where we there are considerable number of youth who are helping the need .we can also see the cases where youngsters are ready to give a part of their hard earned money to help the diseased , needy , etc. , this all help is in order to improve the poor and get their needs for their survival .secondly , effective ruling of the government is needed for the better making of the communities .the government is voted to power by the people .the large percentage of voters is the youth as given by stastical reports given the different countries .if this stastical reports are true then how can we deny that young people are not helping for their communities .thirdly , now-a-days also we find that all the youngsters have a common meeting place during the festivals .for example , chrismas the younsters will given holidays starting a month before .on the day of the chrismas all will have prayers , parties etc. , thus , letting their childern know about the tradition .fourthly , we observe that the young people are taking up the responsibility of helping the aged and old .for example , once i have seen a old person falling on the road because of some health problem .a lot number of young people who were storng enough took him to hosthus , by above all the points it is clear that inspite of having strenuous work in their day to day life , the youngsters are doing a lot of things in order to improve and help their societies .
