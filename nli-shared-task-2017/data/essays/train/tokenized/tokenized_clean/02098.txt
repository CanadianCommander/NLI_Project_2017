i agree that successful people try new things and take risks .if some one would like to become bigger he should take risk because some obne does not know things work or not without trying .even you doing some thing already know you have develop your way of doing and folow the modernism that brought by the age that we live .every day needs of people and treatments toward the life are chanching .i would like to illustrate my opinion with an example .i would like to tell you about a simple farmer who was becoming the king of oil producer in turkey .it is not important the name of the person but its is important the way that he done things .this person used to grow olive and sunflower in izmir one of the biggest city in west turkey .and he thought to produce olive and sunflower oil rather than sell his production .he could earn much if he produce oil from the plants that he growed .an d bought an old oil factory and started his own company .he worked day and night and won the belife of the consumer and growed and growed .the second of the person life wich also demonstrate the benefical site having risk to try new thing that .when the date showed late sixties people have started to chanche their way to buy oil .they before pereferred to buy 20 kg cans but now they buy 2 kg pet bins .so our hero see need of the new needs and bought some new machinery to produce the pet bins that the oil factory .finially , i can say that if this person did not try new things to do , i thing he has still remained as a simple farmer .
