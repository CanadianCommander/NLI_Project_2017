i totally disagree with this statement .why there would be fewer cars in the future ?now i m explaining my opinion .firstly , after a little time from its creation , the car has become the most useful , and used , way to go from a place to another .even if there are several ways to move , for example the public means , like the train , the bus or the aereo , every family , or maybe almost everyone , has one on his own .a car , in fact , allows to not to have limitations of time when you move and then , using it , you can go pratically everywhere .furthermore i find that s a very important thing that you have the possibility to buy the one you best like : you are allowed to choose its colour , its seats , its type , ( familiar , cabrio or any you prefer ! ) , so there is nt the problem to take a journey on a mean you do nt like .the only limitation is the money you can spend , but this is another problem .and for this there s a solution , too : at now every car-seller gives you the opportunity to pay your buyment on rates .last , but not least , i think that the only idea to own a car , gives you a sort of sense of indipendence : you re able to move without the help of someone else , it can be a great satisfation !for these , and many other , arguments , i think that people will continue in buying cars , and in using them of course .in my opinion , if there would be a time when there should be fewer cars , it s right now , because of the high ( to use an euphemysm ) prize of oil , and especially because of the knowledge we have that more cars are the equivalent of more polution in the air all we breath .so , i think , if people do nt stop buying and using cars today , why should they do it tomorrow ?
