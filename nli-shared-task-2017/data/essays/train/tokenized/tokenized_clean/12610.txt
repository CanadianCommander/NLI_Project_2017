we know that facts are synonymous of results .in another way we can associate facts as our daily experience .ideas and concepts for years years have been evoluating , changing from time to time , even if they helped and still help to solve many scientific , socilogical , and psychological dilemma or problems .i am going to show by examples how i believe that facts are more important for students , even if ideas and concepts remain good tools to them .first , i defined facts as experience because experience is one of the main element that motives a students .the experience helps every person to face a similar problem in his or her future life .from an empirique point of view , anytime we have clouds , we should have rain .from a scientific point of view this is not right .for a student , the experience of an internship is something that is enclosed for ever in mind .this is something you can measure , not like just being given 1 + 1 = 2 .it can be in the future 1 + 1 = 3 .second , ideas and concepts are tools that can help to learn facts .students should be prepared for their future that facts are the concretest elements that would lead them to success .because , facts are the element that would help them resolve daily problems they will faced in their working life .societies are guided by their past .in the same way , the students experiences will help him face dispute between colleagues , and be strong to face daily life competition .
