the statement declare that successful people take risks instead of only doing what they know to do well .i partly agree with the statement above .i believe , in fact , that to define a person as successful is a difficult purpose .apart from this personal belief , success can be defined as a situation where a person reaches a wealthy way of life .in this case , i believe the statement present some weaknesses .to reach success people needs to take risks although there are some other qualities and factors that needs to be mentioned .a person to be successful needs to be lucky in life and healthy .people that take risks are usually brave and curious , i strongly believe this two qualities are fondamental to reach a successful situation in the professional life as well as in the private life .on the other side , there are many other factors and components that interfer in life .for example people need to be helped by the fortune .i strongly believe that , in most of the cases , taking risks is not the only component that define a successful situation .a second factor that needs to be mention is the factor of health .a successful profile , usually , is based on a stable personal situation .for this reason , i believe someone that have an healty life have a big chance to reach a high level of success .in conclusion , i do not agree with the statement above .eventhough i consider taking risks an advantage for people to be successful , i trust that a stable profile has , in the same way , a full range of possibilities to reach happyness in life .to sum up , there are too many components that one person needs to take into consideration while defining a profile of a successful persons therefore the statement can be consider too semplicistic and not true .
