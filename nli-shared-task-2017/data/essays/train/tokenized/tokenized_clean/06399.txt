everyone can enjoy life whatever the situation is , how old they are and how much money they got .the important thing is that if a person is aware of enjoying time is an essential of his/her life .in my opinion , i strongly believe that the young people enjoy their life more than older people do .i am going to explain my reasons of this belief in the next sections .firstly , young people are more open to new ideas and mostly they are willing to try new things that they did not experience before .trying new things like paragliding , a game , swimming in cold water make someone s life more excieted .having fresh bodies may also help to exhibit these new offers and wishes .since the action is more easy event in the youngness .secondly , young people have not so much responsibilities like paying house credit , buying newer car or going to more expensive places for dinner .thus , they can take more risks than normally older people do .then they can move more easly then older people do since they have not settled down totally .adventuring new places also gives pleasure to everyone .a cheap trip to north america is an opportunity for young people while an older person would asks which hotel to stay , how long vacation is need .lastly , young people do not have proper job , and they have plenty much time for doing something else .assume that , i have plenty time to spend on my own .i would like to do my staff that i have already delayed but after finishing them i probablt will be get bored and think about what to do else .this brain storming gives new ideas to try .but this needs time to do and all other staff should be completed before it .despite of having enough money and being mature enough , i believe that young people enjoy their life more than older one do in the way of i tried to explain above .
