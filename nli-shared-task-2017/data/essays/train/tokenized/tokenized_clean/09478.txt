there is a recently discussion about if young people enjoy life more than old people do or not .as far as i am concerned , i think the young people can enjoy life more because of the characteristices of young people that is internatonl , mobilization and the ablity to communication .to begin with , with the advent of internet , the world we living in is becoming more smaller than before .today s young people can easily get in touch with the most popular cultures in the world .they are more international than their parents hence they can enjoy the movies in holywood from america , the most fashion clothes from paris and the most exciting football plays from the endland .because of this , they enjoy the life more .furthermore , today ; s young people is mobilization .by car , train and air , they can travell to where they want to go .just contradicting the low quality of transporation their parents having in the past time , we can responbsible to say that the young enjoy life more .the young people can go sight-seeing and enjoy the magnificant cultures all over the world .in addition , for the various ways that people can make a communication , the young peole gain more stronger ability to communicate with others and it makse them more friends .during their study time they can meet lots of people who may be come from different places even countries .those people all may help the young people or provide them many opportunities when they begin to work .so the young people can enjoy life more .but the old people may not enjoy so much friendship because of the limitation of ways of communication .from what has been discussed aboved , we can safety draw a conclusion that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
