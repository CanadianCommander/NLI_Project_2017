i agree with this opinion .i have some reasons to help my opinion .first , idea and concept are always basis of everything when we make a new product or facts .if someone have only a fact , he/she can use that fact but they ca nt use proper usage of this fact .we can use our fact to know their ideas and concepts .when i was a child , my uncle gave me a airplane of paper craft .i can throw it and it will be flying on air .it was surely intersting and exciting for me but i could nt understand why it can fly .it is a childish question but i was so serious .so , i learned to know ideas and concepts are so important at that time .in addition , some people feel annoying on facts if they did nt know ideas and concepts .one of my friend will be angry when he ca nt understand anything .we can say mathematics is also consisted on ideas and concepts .he was answering a question while we were taking a test , and i guessed he had a question which hard to understand when an incident happend .suddenly , he kicked his desk and went out from opuor class room .sometimes not to know ideas and concepts make people upset or somthing feeling bad .at last , if we know ideas and concepts , it will be fun to live in our life .because we might find other usage to enjoy playing or knowing on some facts .this discovery might be big achievement .it might be precious treasure on our life that can help other peoples life or influent good facts to our precious person .so , students should learn ideas and concepts because it can help them to know importance of everything how can we change something bad to good things .it can supply us positive thinking .conclusingly , these are my opinion to understand ideas and concepts that it is more important than to learn facts .i think it is important to know how those facts consist on what ideas and concepts .
