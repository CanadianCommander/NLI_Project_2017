it could be said , it really depends on what kind of type the person is , therefore , i agree with this opinion .some people successed with only doing what they already know how to do well but i hardly believe that the kind of peple could successed only in limit of levels .no risks but no big returns .i think that successful people try new thing not just to money but they like to try new thing .as a result of their action , they earn a lot of mony and find a different way to successed from others .thinking about our computerized life , when i was a junior high school student , nobody know what the internet means .only few people showed their interest on it and start some internet business .nowadays internet business is the one of most successful business but they always have to try new things and develop their knowledge and technics .if they do nt , no longer become to successful people !also if people in this world are doing only they already know things , our cultures and industries have no chance to improve .we always need to seek something new to us .of course there are some risks all the time to do new things , but if we do nt try , we ca nt gain anything including the meanings of successful .i do nt want to think all the time to become successful person but i always want to try to be a challenging person for everythins .and someday , i may become one of a successful person .
