i agree with the statement .in korea , all the highschool students work on only studying .also their parents force to them study .as a result , all the students lose time to help their communities .they do not even help their family .most of korean lives in apartments .once upon a time , everyone knew all the members in their town , and there was not someone who do not know in their town , because they always cared about their neighborhoods .however the apartment do not give any chance to meet their neighborhoods .one more , the jobs are getting more proffesional .everyone engage in different part of jobs .so they do not have chance to think about their neighrhoods and communities .so the reasons i think are studying , apartment and proffesionalizing of jobs .first of all , the studying culture made students do not help their communities .in highschool , all the students compete eachother so badly , they do not have anytime to think their communities .they will have to go to academies after school , and they will be so tired .after the academies , they will fall asleep right after arriving at home .this culture make this society like that .second , living in apartments is one of the reasons .apartment is a seperated place .all the people do not care about their neighbors and do not know who are their neighrborhoods .the apartments are getting so big , and they will not remember who are the neighborshoods .then no one will help each other , because they do not know each other .this is big problem of apartment .third , i think proffesionalizing of jobs is the biggest reason .originally , people engaged on same work in korea .everyone growed crops .the agriculture was developed in korea , so they always helped eachother .however , these days , everyone has different jobs .so they will help only people who are in their companies .neighborhoods will not have any chance to meet each other .helping communities is really important to live this society .if we need help , no one will help us .we need to help each other and make good realationship with all the people in our communication and society .
