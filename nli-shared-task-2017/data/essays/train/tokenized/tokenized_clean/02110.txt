through my experience , i can say that this statement is right .take a math for example , during my high school days , i had to answer lots of questions .a math teacher explained the concepts first , and then made us answer questions .if i could understand the concepts , it was not difficult to answer the questions .so when i studied other subjects such as a chemistry and physics etc .i applied same method , that is , understanding the concepst , first .here is another example .in terms of parenting , especially money related , i think good parents is not the person who can give big money to their children but teach how can make money .you might think this is a different story , but it is related to the topic , i think .all parents want their children to be succeed and rich .but ther are to types of parents .one is just tell their children how they made money , and instructs to do something to make money wihout explaning what it is the concepts behind facts .another type wants to explain what is impotant and more eccential .they know that facts will change , yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts , you can improvise to any circumstances .many young people inherit big money from thier parents , yet for those reason i mentioned above , lots of people do nt maintain their wealth .things is always changing , and i think along with the changing surrounding the facts can be chaged .
