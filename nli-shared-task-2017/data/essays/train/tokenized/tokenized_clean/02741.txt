today , there are countless cars on this planet .but are there suficient resources to maintain those cars ? .i do nt think so .therefor i strongly disagree with the topic scentence .first , let s think about the resource problems .even now , the price of the gas is increasing by second .in my oppinion , it shows how resources are limited and how much we have spent .it is so simple that everyone can assume that , if there are limited resources and increasing demand for the fuel would make the reasource to be finish faster .so after twenty years , there will be fewer cars .second , our tecnology in advancing like flesh light of camera .i can imagine how long will we use cars by , for example , i remember there was cummunicating system which can only accept the phone call .but it was disapered after mobile phone was invented eventhough it was very popular in my country .therefor advancing tecnology would not let cars to remain after twenty years after .the last reason that i suppots my idea might be the pollution problems .cars are creating pollutions like air , noise .that refer to we need more advnced type of transports .in conclusion , i claimed that after twenty years there will be fewer car .in supporting passage , i said that scaresity of resources and rapid advancing tecnology and needs for advanced transpots reason for polluting environments .
