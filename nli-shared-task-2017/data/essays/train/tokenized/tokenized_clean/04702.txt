the statement given is that the young people in the modern society are not showing interest in helping the communities .yes i agree with the statement mentioned due to many reasons .one of the reason is that the students now-a-days are showing lots of interest in the enjoyment itself .they spend most of the time with their freinds and goes to pubs or some other place and spend time .now-a-days the culture is like this and even their parents are not showing interest in guiding the children .the young students prefer to spend most of their time in playing games .this is a great enjoyment for them .the other reason is that the people now-a-days became very competitive and the only aim for them is to reach the higher positions and earn more money .so , in order to achieve this they are working more and more hours and they are not at all looking to help the social organisations .for example , i can consider my freind as he got was recruited in social community office .here service should be done to old people and the children who lost their parents but the pay will be little less .he done the job for two months without willingness and gave up ultimately .he do nt have interest in sevice and he needs more money .i think this is a good example for the above explanation .one more reason is that the mindset of the young people will be somewhat selfishness and always compares with the neighbouring people .what those people did , they want to do the samething and seek higher positions .they wont bother about the society and the people who need some help from them .
