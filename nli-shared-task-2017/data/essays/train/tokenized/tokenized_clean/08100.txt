even if it always usefull to know some major facts , i advocate the fact that it is more important , and fundamental , to understand ideas and concepts beyond the facts .there are three reasons why i perfer to understand concepts than to learn facts .first , to understand the concept may allow you to find or discover the fact .for instance , during a biology experiment you can get the right conclusions by reasoning .another way to get the result could be to know by heart the answer  , but next time the result may be totally different and you ll not be able to explain why .so learning without understanding may drive you to some dead ends .that also the case in a lot of areas linked to mathematics .you can find the most of the answers by manipulating a few concepts you understood .in addition , the understanding is the basic of any scientific domain which are , nowadays , so highly valued .second , i think that this training of the mind will help you to adapt easily in new situations .i learned japanese characters a few years ago .i was in china a few months ago and i had no big troubles to deduce the meaning of the characters and find my way in the city of shanghai .even if the chinese characters are more complex than the japenese ones , you can still deduce the meaning thanks to the asociation of the unitary characters composing the bigger ones ( called kanjis )last , i m sure it is the best way to remind things easily .for instance if i ask you : do you know what are the main colors used by miro in his paintings .you may know it because you saw many paintings from this artists but a very easy way to remind it is the following one .once you know that miro used to live in a small city called ` mont roich  , which is a small city close to the sea .you begin to understand the first colors is the red .it comes from roich , which is close to red .the second color is the blue which represents the sea .the third color is the green of a certain plant ` the carroubier  .and the least one is the color of flower : yellow .
