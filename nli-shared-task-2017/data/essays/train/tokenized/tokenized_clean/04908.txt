` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .the first question which i have to ask myself is : how to define young , respectively old ?a girl born in europe in the year 2006 will become approximately 90 years old .a couple of decades ago this figure seemed to be unbelievable .( note : also for the majority of the world s population such an age is quite unlikely . )still scientists in europe agree on describing life of consisting of different ` spheres of age  .first period : 0-20 , second period 20-45 and third period up from 45 .even within this categories there are many , many splits like the ` third age  from 80 onwards .from my point of view young people are between the age of 0 and 45 , old people from the age of 45 up to x .so far we see that life expectation has increased but the question is if young people enjoy life more than older people do .as we live nowadays in a fast changing world ( e.g. globalisation ) this has also influenced the ` joy of life  .for instance in europe in the late 1950s up to the late 1980s it was easy to predict somebodys curriculum , the likelihood of job-hopping was quite low , also the worrry about environment like global warming did not play such an important role as it does nowadays .as a result of the change of ` outer-circumstances  ( globalisation , growth of life-expectancy , environmental questions , etc . )also the way how people ( can ) enjoy their life has changed .from my point of view in the year of 2007 young people can not enjoy life as much as old people do .young people can not be sure about there future .things like job opportunities , environmental damages , wars on resources like oil , a fast and sudden changing world et cetera make life much more unpredictable as it used to be .still young people can enjoy life but only in short terms : young people can enjoy their weekends , their holidays and their free-time in general .but can they enjoy their long-term future ?can they enjoy their studies at university by being always aware of the job-opportunities ?in contrast i think older people can be more sure about there future .some of them might still need to work some years until they reach a sudden age ( e.g. 65 ) and from then on they can enjoy their pension .in contrast to their younger relevants they do not have to care so much about personal impacts of long-term future and it s problems like wars on resources ( e.g. there will be still oil for app .30 years ) nor do they have to be always ` fit for the market  .nowadays some researcher also say that old people are more financialy potential than young people which often makes life easier and more enjoyable .finaly i would like to say that this gap between old and young people scares me a little bit - on the one side young people with an unknown future on the other side the old generation with plenty of time and money to enjoy future . ..
