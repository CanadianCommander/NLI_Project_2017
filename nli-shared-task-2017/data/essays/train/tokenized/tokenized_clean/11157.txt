i tortally agree about this issue .in these days , the youth are extremly busy .i mean they have no spare time to help their communities .the society wants that young people become a perfect person .nowadays the rate of jobless people is more and more increasing , moreover it .spreads wide that the entrance exam to college is most important in one s life .because of this situation , schools and their parents require them just ` studying  .this is a middle-school student s time table .she wakes up at 7 am and then goes to school .after the class  over at 4 or 5 pm , they goes to institute learning math , english , even chinese every day .they are always stressed out for their life without a chance to do something .so the reason is why they can not have time to help their communities if they wants .
