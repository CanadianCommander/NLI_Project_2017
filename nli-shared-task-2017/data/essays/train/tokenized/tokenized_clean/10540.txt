`` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .my decision to agree or disagree on this topic might depend a lot on the definitions of young people and old people .let us decide , for the sake of clarity that a young person is someone who is below the age of 25 , who is still in undergraduate college and older people are people above the age of 50 who have achieved financial securities in their lives and are about to attain their retirement age .still with this definition too , its hard to actually quantify enjoyment .looking at the situtation from a broader perspective though , i would sure say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .let me put forward a case which might explain my point in detail .take for example , the things that young people do in their leisure time .they hang around with their girl friends / boy friends and other close friends , they party out , they go for movies , discotheques and they take pleasue from all sorts of entertainments available on this planet .on the other hand , you would nt expect the same behaviour from older people .they would rather stay at home and enjoy the pleasure and warmth the home has to provide .sipping by the sunday afternoon s tea , eating biscuits , watching their grandsons play in the garden is how many old people visualize their leisure time to be spent .they have actually witnessed a lot in the 50 years span of their lives , that these little things in nature bring a great deal of enjoyment to them than anything else .also , older people benefit a great deal through their experience .they know how the world works .they are better equiped with dealing the ups and downs of life .also , they have financial security and are more cautious in the decisions they make .thus , a great deal of your happiness depends on these small things in life .older people are better organized in sorting out these small things in life .on the other hand , most youth are in a confused state of mind .they re still maturing day by day learning how cruel the world can be at times .also , they are not financially secure .young people often take decisions in haste for which they repent later .thus , as we have seen above , `` enjoyment  depends a great deal on how it is quantified and defined .it rather depends on a particular individual as to whether he has enjoyed his life more in his youth or when his hairs turned grey .but it so happens , that your best years are your undergraduate years when you study in college and are away from your parents .this is the time where you meet new people and foster relations that you remember them for the rest of your life .so looking objectively at the situation , young people can get a great deal out of life than their older counterparts can .
