in this ambivalent society , the issue whether there will be fewer numeber of vehicles on the land in the future or not is often raised and debated .a portion of society believes that there will be much more cars in our lives , since the opportunity of delivering goods increases as time goes by ; however , i have a differing idea .in twenty years , the number of cars will decrease because the society encounters environmental and social changes : the greenhouse effect , and globalization .one example of a trigger that makes the number of cars reduce can be seen in the responses to the greenhouse effect .as society grows , environmental issues are raised , especailly the greenhouse effect .this effect , caused by damaging gases emitted from cars , harms ecological order by influencing sea level to rise .furthermore , unexpectedly changing climates threatens human live directly : tsunami in indonesia .therefore , people begin to invent alternative vehicles that does not make harmful gases , such as hybrid vehicles .in addition , the increasing uses of bikes encourage people to avoid air pollution .thus , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in our lives to protect our surronding safe and clean .not only do the current events furnish an endless array of examples encapsulating the claim that the number of cars on land will be reduced in the future , but social trend does as well ; a prime example is globalization .as the whole world become a one town , the opportunity to trade and travel among foreign countries has been expanding .as a result , rather than cars that are limited in only one continent , airplanes will attract more people in the future .for example , according to the research in korea , about 85 % of the nation prefers airplanes as transportation .also , as most companies , such as samsung , lg , and sony , expands their markets toward other countries , the importance of taking airplanes , instead of driving cars in domestic markets , are percieved by many nations .in the paragraphs above , i have shown that in twenty years , there will be much fewer cars in our live , but much more alternative vehicles that prevent environment and help to adopt international trend , globalization .so , i call the readers to make technological progress in innovating our limited transportation to prepare comming future society .
