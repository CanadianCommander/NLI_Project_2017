i definitely disagree with it .for the most people , youth is not a time for personal enjoyment for one s life but a period to thrive themselves desperately to accomplish stability in their later life .in today , almost every country in the world has a system of capitalism .as we know , a society can never make the fair distribution of wealth under this system .of course , some people might can acieve stability by getting money or fame earlier than others , but they can also lose this easily by various unlucky events .also , many young people ( usually teenagers ) have many limits on enjoying their lives .for instance , they can neither smoke nor drink , they have to follow their school s order as a student , and they are forced to learn more and more which they regard as an unnecessary thing .increase of population gives a big impact on this , too .since many young people are thriving to get an accomplishment of their learning , it is impossible for them to compete with each other .increasing population makes this tremendously harder .
