we all hope that we want to enjoy our lives .then this question comes to my mind , which enjoy life more , young people or older people ?i think young people enjoy life more than older people .there are three reasons .first , young people have healthier bodies than older people do .second , they have longer time in rest of their lives than the older people do .third , older people tend to say that the younger the better .first of all , young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do .they can continue to work longer , run faster , need shorter time to sleep , and so on than the old people do .that means young peopel can enjoy what the old people can not do .for example , they can swim in the mornig , go out for lunch , go shopping , and have party with their friends .second , they have longer time remained in their lives than the old people do .if you want to be a very good and famous doctor , it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor .young people can plan and achieve this aime because they have time .however , old people may not beacuse they only have limited time in rest of their lives .finally , i often hear old people say that the younger the better .i am still young and can only imagine how the lives of old people .the old people , however , experienced life of young people already and say the younger the better comparing their lives to the ones when they were young .to conclude .i believe young people enjoy life more than old people .they have strong body to do anything they want while old people have limitations because of their health problems .also , young people have longer time to do anything .in addition , old people admit that the younger the better .i strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than old people .actually , i think , that means young people have to challenge anything they want and have to enjoy their lives to the max .
