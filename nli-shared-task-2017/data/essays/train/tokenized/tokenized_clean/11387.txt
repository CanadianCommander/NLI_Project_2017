humankind always need knowledge to reach goodlife standarts .therefore knowledge is a very important aspect of a person s life .there are different point of views about the types of knowledges what people should have .firstly some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in contrary to those some think that specializing in one specific subject is better .i personally agree with the first idea depending on three reasons .first of all , person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would have more job opportunities than a person who is specified in one subject .secondly , i think that people should be aware of what is going on in the world for being an intellectual person .the last , but not least , if someone wants to have a deep , rich conversation he should be able to know about a lot information about the life .first of all , a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would have more job opportunities than a person who is specified in one subject .for example you are a businessman and you manage a business .if you want to hire a employee to your marketing department and you have two choices .first one is a guy with specific and exact information about marketing sector and there is other choice , he knows about both marketing and computer as well as communication .which one would you prefer ?secondly , i think that people should be aware of what is going on in the world wide on the way of being an intelligence person .therefore we could have much opportunities of communicating , applying any kind of job , being speakable and etc .the last , but not least , if someone wants to have a deep , rich and wide conversation that person should be able to know about a lot of information about the enviroment , life and the world wide .therefore he could have many topics to talk on does not matter who he wants to speak .if he gets with a dentist he should be able to know about the teeth , like brushing it , caring it or how to fix if you have a problem about it .therefore the person would have many friends and be much more attractive to the people in his enviromentall in all , as i said before people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject for both having more opportunities for jobs and being an intelligence person as well as getting more friends and being able to have a conversation with anyone he likes to .as i mentioned above i am trying to improve myself in every topic that i could be able to gain information about it .by doing this i am believing that i could reach goodlife standarts and have much more friends .therefore i will always try to improve myself in every topic that i could get to know of .
