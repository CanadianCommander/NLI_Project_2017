some people aclaim that they prefer to travel alone , while others oppsite it .despite assorted opinions to the contrast , as for me , i would not hesitate to agree that travelling alone is the best the way to travel .there are some reasons as follows .to begin with , travelling alone is free .we can go anywhere we want and have no need to listen the guides  requirement .however , if we are in a group led by a tour guide , we have to comply with the guides  .it entirely possible that there are some places we do not like to stay long but the guide still take us to go .then we will feel unhappy .there is no doubt that our purpose for travelling is releave stress and entertain our life .however , it makes us feel more annoy .then why should we go with a guide ?besides , in nowadays some guides like to take the visitors to the place which are not really interesting place but shops to let us buy a myriad things which are so-called `` memorary gift  .it not only wastes lots of money but also make us feel boring about the tour .to illustrate it , there is a persuasive example .last year , jane went to lushan in xian province with a lot of people , which is her first time to go there .she thought it would be an indelible experience .however , after she got there , the guide did not take them to climbe the mountaon instead of asking them to buy some photoes first .and them he also take them to a shop nearby and make them consume many things for the reason that they can symbol that they had been to lushan .admittedly , travelling alone is dangerous to some degree .however , it is obvious that it instrmental rather than detrimental to us .therefore , with thoroughly considerating , i can draw that i would incline to travel by my own .
