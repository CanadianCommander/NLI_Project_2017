the issue of whether or not to travel in a group led by a tour guide is controversial .some people think that a guide is important to lead them to the most popular places .others believe they can travel by themselves without the help of a guide .in fact , i agree that people do nt really need to travel in groups led by tour guides due to two basic reasons .cearly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide impose many restrictions .everybody need to be prompt .in case of an emergency or lateness , people might lose one whole day becasue the guide wo nt be waiting for them .they need to manage themselves usually staying in the hotel watching television .this might cause alot of inconvenience , such as getting bored .instead , people traveling without being restricted by a group , can take their time to do what they want .for example , they will take the needed time to sleep and rest .furthermore , they would have the option of changing their destination whenever they want .for intance , if they planned on going to disney land then knew about another place , they wo nt hesitate a minute to change their plan .truely , the tour guide will have greater knowledge about the most tourist visited places .this does nt mean that people traveling alone do nt know where they re going .there are many resources available to people , where they know the wonderful places in a specific country .for instance , people can surfe the internet or visit agencies .these places provide almost all what is needed to know .evidently , people traveling in groups face many problems that leads to vacation ruining .on the other hand , traveling alone does nt mean being lost .yet , it means having more relaxation , time and opinions .
