in my view , in twenty years the number of cars will increase tremendously .many people believe cars to be more comfortable , and with the increase in their standard of living , in time more and more peple will be able to afford cars .also , the banks and other financial institutions are helping people in many ways to buy new cars in easy installments .firstly , i believe that a car has become a necessity for every family .many people consider cars to be the most comfortable and safest way of travelling .they prefer to commute in cars , rather than using public transport etc .morover , it has also , become a status symbol for school and college students and people in their early twenties .everybody craves for a car , as soon as they get their driver s license .the popularity of cars has increased tremendously .therefore , i feel that in the coming years , the popularity of cars will definitely increasesecondly , the economies of various countries are growing tremendously .for example in our country , the per capita is increasingly continiusly , and is expected to grow even more in the years to come .this will result in better job prosects , increase in the wages , and improvement in standard of living .thus , as a result of this continious growth , more and more people will be able to afford cars .therefore , many people , twenty years hence will be able to buy cars or themselves , resulting in the increase of cars .finally , banking instituions are coming up with new schemes everyday in which people can buy cars in easy instalments these insitutions are expected to bring better plans in the future which will help the the common man to buy these cars .this step will defenitely lead to the blooming of the car industry .also , technology is improving at an extrmely fast pace .there might be a possibility that they might introduce new cars , which are cheaper and cost-effective .these cars will be aimed at the not so very rich people .thus , the advancements in the years to come will defenitely aid in the growth of cars .
