i disagree with the stament that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .life is becoming shorter every day .time is everything and every minute is worth a fortune .people have more things to do , much more responsibilities and activities to perform within society .work demands more every day that goes by , and productivity is an every day word in our vocabulary .new inventions and equipment is constantly being created to help people save time and energy .time flies and we keep flying behind it trying to catch up .a car is one of the most important inventions that save us time and energy .it is the basic main of transportation in this world of instant results .regardless the fact that is also a luxury and a pleasure to some people , it s main purpose is to take us to a specific place in the less amount of time possible .that is the basic reason why i believe that the amount of cars will keep increasing in the next several years .however , i do think that the size of the cars is going to change .vehicles will become smaller and more compact .so that there can be more space in the streets .the car will no longer be seen as a luxury or an object of comfort but as a practical machine that saves us time , just as a computer or a calculator does .i strongly believe that the amount of cars will not decrease twenty years from now , on the contrary i think the car population will increase more and more , but a car will no longer be seen as it has been these past years .it will be a necessary instrument of our every-day life , like a toothbrush or a refrigerator .it will prevail and be even more popular .it will become smaller and more practical , more economic and less exclusive .looks will be a secondary thing while economy , space saving and good performance will be the main characteristics to be considered within the next decades .the car will stay with us as long as no other machine takes it s place .
