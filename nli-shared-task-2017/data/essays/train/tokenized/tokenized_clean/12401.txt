i do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older , thus , may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activities , older people have also some advantges of the old ages provide them .young poeple are energetic and active , hence , often dominate most of the daily life activities we see around .however , when compared to older people , younger ones have more responsibilty , which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life .for example , i and my sister are working in full time jobs , which make us to spend all day in work .besides that , we are studying for graduate degrees and this takes most of our free time .however , my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement years , spend their days with shopping , wandering around , travelling and hosting family members in the weekends .another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family members more than the younger ones have been .in my culture , senior people are highly respected .they have been consulted for experiences they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span .that is , they are often visited by familty members , by relatives , which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do .one other point is that having developed a mature taste of preferences , older poeple do not spend time trying new things spend their times in a more quality way .yet , young people generally like trying new things as if they have not developed permanent life preferences .in other words , young people can be thought as they are still in their life cycle , which can be characterized by flcutuations in tastes and preferences .therefore , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .both age groups have their own advantages and disadvantages .while young people may be healthier and more active than old people , older people can enjoy many different aspects of life .the more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in , one should know how to enjoy life .
