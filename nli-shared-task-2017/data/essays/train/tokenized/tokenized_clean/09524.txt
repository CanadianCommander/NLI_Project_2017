in my opinion young people do not support their communities as much as they should .i have several resons for this opinion .young people today are very much caring about their own free time and the activities they do .they do not see the community that is around them but only their own benefit .for example , a lot of young boys use skating rinks to skateboard , however very few of them actually helped building the sites so that the kids of the community can enjoy the rinks .reason number two is rather obvious as well .doing volunteer work that is an unpayed job and at the first glance boring to do , is not very attractive to young people .they fail to see the bigger picture and are often not encouraged by parents of other respected persons to help and give some of their time .i think that it is this lack of encouragement that causes such a low rate in volunteering activities of young people .at the same time i am assuming that young people also do nt see or get any incentives by engaging in the community .this problem can be solved by creating special programmes that will spark the interest of young people .they need to be designed towards the needs and abilities of the youngsters in oder to fully work out .the creativity of the youth needs to be addressed in possible projects or incentives .if they can get an opportunity to present their talent , say they like to spray gaffity and get the opportunity to spray a wall legally as a trade off for helping out at a nursing home , i think they are much more likely to consider helping out in the community than they would without this incentive .in my opinion young people would help more than they are doing now , if the job assigned and the incentives given are more suitable to their needs today .the problems and ideas i have stated could be a start .
