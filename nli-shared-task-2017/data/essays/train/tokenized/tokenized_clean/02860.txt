the issue at hand is if young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is a very interesting question because the industrialised countries face an increasing average age of their inhabitants and an increasing life expectancy .this accelerates an aging society with less younger people .but does this mean that there is less fun in life for these people ?in my opinion , old people can enjoy life as the younger ones do .in fact , older people enjoy a lot of free time which they can use to take part in various leisure activities .for example pensioners have a lot of time which they can use to travel not depending on their company or school vacations which makes their travel more relaxing and their destinations less crowded .furthermore , a majority of the elderly possess large amounts of money which they can spend on their hobbies .having probably paid off most of their debts and not being forced to raise their children anymore they can use their savings for themselves .for example , older people can buy goods which they have always dreamed of while the younger ones still have to work and save money .additionally , as medical treatments are more and more developed , the older people can still enjoy their lives by continuing to do sports , improving their quality of life and health .for instance , compared to drugs in the past there are more soft treatments , suppressing the disadvantages of the aging process by using hormones , enabling them to do many sports the younger ones can do , too .lastly , more and more products and services for the elderly are created , making their daily life more enjoyable .older peolpe are seen as `` silver market  by several industries , being offered many products developed exclusively for them just like group travels in which people of the same age meet and explore foreign countries .all in all i think that i have shown that being old does not mean that older people can not enjoy life .they might even be able enjoy life a little bit more than the younger ones do .
