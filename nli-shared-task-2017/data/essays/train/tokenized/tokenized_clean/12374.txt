yes , i do think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .after all , it is one objective of publicity and i think it is well achieved , especially nowadays .today , there are ads everywhere you look .on internet , on the streets , in the metro , on tv and even in public washroom .big companies have the power to buy a lot of publicity spaces and by placing their advertissements everywhere it can definitively makes you think that their product is better then it actually .this can make you think that a certain product is the new trend .it is everywhere so why not in your home .many reality tv shows use such an approach .they talk about it during the news , the ads are everywhere , you can chat we the `` stars  , you can support your favorite star . ..but the show is usually not that great .also , a lot of advertisements feature stars .most nike products refer to a professional athlete for example .they want you to think that if you are wearing the new jumpman basketball shoes , you might be as good as micheal jordan .people do not think that they will be as good as the stars of course , but at least they will be equip just like they are .but having a product related to a star does not tell anything about its quality .there is also a huge focus made in publicity on the fact that a certain product is new .most people think that a new product or a new technology is always better than the previous one while this is not true .just think about the ski market .each year a new type of ski is released : parabolic ski , mini ski and on top of that , they are designed with new materials .this impression of new makes the product look better than the previous one while many scientific research often prove the contrary .because advertissements are everywhere , it features stars and focus on new , i think it looks better than it
