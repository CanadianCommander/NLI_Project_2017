i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .it is hard to agree with one or the other .but there are several reasons that drawn me into this conclusion .first , having a lot of knowledge of many academic subjects will give you different views of things .i believe that it will help you grow as a person .when you encounter a problem , if you know that there are more then one side on everything in this world and be able to try to look at the problem from other sides , it will be easier for you to get through the problem .however , if you are into just one thing , even though you know a lot about it , because all you have learned in your life is your specialization , you will have hard time passing through those problems .second , it might seem great to specializing in one specific subject , but there always are greater people above you .and more you are into the subject , more you suffer from not being the best .this argument fails unless you are not the best .but how many bests are there ?yes , one .there are more chances for you to be the non-best .third , let me put this whole quesion into the real world .if you are specialized in one subject .you might get paid well .you might get a good spot at work .but you are not a hero at home .you are just a person , who brings a lot of money to your house .however , if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people that matters , your family will appreciate you being able to answer questions about a lot of things .i would rather be a hero at home with my family i care about then a hero at work to have a happy life .the opinion you come up with on this subject has a lot to do with what kind of person you are .i am a kind of person , who values my friends and family .it is important to for me to stay heppy and not depressed .it could be a waste of life for some people .but to me , having good time means living the life the fullest .i do not want to live my life suffering .that is why i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
