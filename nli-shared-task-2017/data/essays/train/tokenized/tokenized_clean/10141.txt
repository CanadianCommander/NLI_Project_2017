being successful is about knowing what you are doing and how you are doing it .but it s also about taking chances and working hard to seek your ambitions and aspirations .and to do so , people should try new things and take new chances .but at the same time , they should be very careful with their actions and decisions , so that they wo nt regret if anything had happened wrong .first , in order to be successful , people should know exactly what they want and what they are looking for .for example , if a man wants to be successful in his job he needs to be working for something he really likes and he s really good at .and not doing something just because that was the only opprotunity he got .he should try and find what he is good at and find what he really wants .having a successful life is about having a happy , fulfilled and satisfying life .second , people who want to be successful should go and find their own chances instead of just waiting for the chances to come to them .and if they passed through something hard along the way they should try their best to make it through without crumbling .they have to make the best out of everything .third , successful people have to obtain the knowledge and the wisdom on how to keep their success rising instead of falling .being successful once does nt mean that someday you wo nt be a failure .a person has to be confident in his work so that he would nt regret his actions later .to become a seccessful person and to obtain that postition .you have to know what you are looking for , try to reach out for your goals , and being confident in what you are doing .and at the end you will have a happy life .
