i agree with the point that is successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do as well .firstly , the people who likes to explore can learn more about something news than do the old things or repite same things people .though the explore things , you can find the thing which you never have been seen or do it , and you will love to the world .because you find something which you do nt knew .it called knowledges .yeah , the world is wonderful , if you do not believe that , the only things you lost is your heart .it means you have nt bold .secondly , there was impossible that the people who knows everything .people is not god , and god will not help the man who would not do anything .you maybe knows one thing or few things more than others , others may know others things than you in truthly .people learned things from books , tvs , newspapers , computers , etc .so the knowledges are limits things .you can though you explore eyes , your hot heart , your heathly bodies , to try , to find , to do the things which is fine , is worth to do .last but not least , people do the things and get successful is not easy things .you must try you best to do this .you do nt sit a nice place and wish i could be successful .everyone wish himself or herself is a successful man or woman .if you are just think about it , and not pay your action , your time , your power , it could become unsuccessful .the man is impossible got know everything , if there is a man who knows everything , it must be from his expriense .where can we get from ?yap , try your best to try new things , form it , you will be grow up .let us try .
