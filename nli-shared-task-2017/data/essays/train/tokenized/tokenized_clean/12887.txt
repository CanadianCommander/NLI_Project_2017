i would love to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .but it is sad to see in human history that most times we have made the good choices too late .however two major contemporary problems seem to support this opinion : the huge ammount of air pollution caused by vehicules all around the world and the fact that we are running out of fuel reserves .which means that basicly we should stop using our cars as much for the sake of the environment and we are going to have to anyway in the future .at least in what concerns cars as we know them today .so the question is : why are nt we changing now the way our vehicules work since we are going to have to do it anyway ?why not find today an energy that would keep our cars running but would nt pollute ?the truth is that modern technology is able to do that - cars that run with electricity or solar panels exist - but the finantial intrest of these massive gas and oil companies seems to come first .i once heard a sentence that resumes this attitude .two oil investors , one says to the other : `` one day with all the money we make from industry we will be able to clean up the environment  .but this is simply not true .at one point it does become too late .we have to act now so that in twenty years there will be indeed fewer cars that cause pollution .this transition can be done today with significant changes .for example , why should every member of a family have a car when one is enough ?we should all start taking the bus .
