eventhogh i am not a big fan of cars , unlike my friends who have to stop when they see nice cars , i think there will be the same amount of cars as today .these are well-known turth that cars are polluting the air remarkably and the oil is running out quickly .however , the cars are such importnat machines in our society , and the scientists are developing new technologies since they are well aware of the fact that the air pollution has becoming the one of the biggest global problems and the world needs other alternative way of running the cars rather than only petrol .the car has significant importance in modern society .these days people are extremely depended on the cars , they go anywhere either using personal cars or public transportation such as bus .so it is hard for people living in mordern to imagine a day without any sor of cars .and the cars made our lives easir to move from one place to another , without cars people will be less mobile and one movement will require lots of time and energy for them .enormous numbers of scientist are working on the research for alternative resources that can be used a source of running the cars .plus , that alternative resource will create less or zero pollutant unlike petrol , i have been hearing the news about making sunlight-powered cars which stores energy from the sunlight and can work with the enrgy like the sunlight-powered houses .this will help to solve the problem of not finding any alternative source before the complete running out of petrol and air pollution .but it also has problem of no sufficient sunlight supply , and to solve this problem , the scientists will still working on the devloping or finding new resorces that can be used solely in the cars or in the sunlight-powered cars when the sunlight is not enough to run the car .the cars have too important role in the society that they canno be disapear and developing technology will find the way to solve the problem of worsening the air pollution and less oil available in the world , thus i think there will still same or more amount of cars in twenty years .
