in my point of view , i agree that young people enjot life more that older people do .young as the people are , they receive information more quickly than the older .thus , when they they want to enjoy their life they have more ideas , more passion , and more creativity .firstly , nowadays , each time we receive a piece of new information we hold a new idea .providing that we do nt have the internet we ca nt enjoy mass media resources .the older people are not able to enjoy them due to the limit of the knowledge of the internet .young people dive into the ocean sea for the sakes of the new technology , imagining that if young people ca nt get the new idea they wo nt do that .however , the old people may not or dare not .secondly , i think young people have a strong passion for life .they dream for their future .as being in the young group , i always plan my bright future no matter what problems i encounter , thus i am getting ready for anything to happen in the next minute .i do nt think the old people are willing to accept all that is not pleasant .life is full of unperdiction and i think the best way to enjoy it is to enjoy the unknown things happening .we are passionate enough to face the life .thirdly , life should be around with creativity .there is impossibile that a lot of things such as romantic things , surprising things are supposed to happen to us without our creativity .i think the young people are more creative than the older ones .if we want to enjoy the life it ca nt be emphasized any more that creativity is required .a lot of family problems is caused by less creativity .therefore , our young people should take the advantage of holding various creavitity to enjoy life .life is enjoyed with passion , creativity , and ideas .young people , as the majority part of society , should do it better that the older people .
