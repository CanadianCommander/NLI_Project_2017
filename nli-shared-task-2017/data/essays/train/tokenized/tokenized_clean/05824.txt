i am graduated from sabanci university ( su ) , one of the leading universities in turkey .in su , the educational system is different than other universities and it is the only one which is different .the difference is that all students are to take the same classes in the freshman and sophomore years , and to take their classes of interest on the following two years .the students are educated in order to have a similar background which includes many diverse areas of study , and to be specialized in their area of study afterwards .for instance , a student from the mechanical engineering program has to pass the history or the humanities class , whereas a student from the visual arts program has to pass the nature of science or the mathematics class .this system lets students have broad knowledge of many academic subjects without a major specialization and i think this system will lead future generations to more interdisciplinary areas of study and cause strong and mutually beneficial business cooperations forming more specific business fields .students , having experienced such varying fields , will be more determined about which subject to specialize in during their postgraduate studies .i , having graduated from su in visual arts and visual communications design program , am now eager to have my ma in sound design .without having been through a variety of subjects during my education in su , i would not be so determined and confident to make such a decision .
