a number of people have asserted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .while the first reaction of some people may disagrees with this statement , there are some compelling reasons to explore this issue in more depth .concering the status quo of today s society , i personally agree with this statement for the following two reasons .first , the atmosphere of competition is getting stronger in many fields , such as career or study .people treat educational degree with more seriousness , and consequently , people are required to persuit higher degree than past days .nowadays , parents are aware of this change in the society .as a result , they expect their children pay exclusive attention to their studies , or specifically , to everything which is helpful to their education .helping the communities simply turns to a waste-of-time behavior if it is not beneficial to the studies .in addition , the security problems also reduce people s willingness to help the communities .there are more crimes or robbery acts happened at the dark corner of the street all the time .parents are worried about the children  safty , and as a consequence fewer and fewer parents or adults will encourage their children hang arount outside as long as the neiborhood is alarme with a signal of unsafty .there is one true example happened to my mom .last year she just walked home after the work , she unfortunally robbered by a young man .her bags was gone as well as some amount of money .my mother was terrfying , and she started warning me that i have to come home no later then six oclock under on circumstance , and tried my best not to hang around the community becasue it was very dangerous .all of the reasons have influenced my perspectives concering this issue .with no doubt , there is also an argument to be made for the opposing position on this matter .nevertheless , with the reasons i have presented above , i believe my argument is built on a solid foundation .
