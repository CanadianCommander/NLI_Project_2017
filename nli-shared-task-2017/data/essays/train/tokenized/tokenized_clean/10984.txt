i agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .some people reccomend to know the facts , but i think tstudents should understand them first because of the improtance of knowing the basic information , the possibility to misunderstand the facts without basic knowledge , and getting ability to think about cause and effect .first of all , students usually lean from teachers with textbooks because textbook have the important information for studnets .i understand that knowing facts is also somehow useful for students and they can learn other things which are not indicated in textbooks .however , it is more significant for students to learn subjects from basic .secondly , i do nt think students can understand the facts without basic knowledge .not all facts have regular environment or situation like indication of textbooks , so students may misunderstand the facts which is irregular .however , if students learn basic knowledge first , they could recognize what is regular facts and irregular facts .some facts require people to learn advenced knowledge to understand them , so it is more critical for students to study ideas and concepts first .finally , if students know the ideas and concepts , they could think the cause and the effect of facts when they face the facts which they have not learned previously .moreover , just knowing facts is not useful for them because facts are not always normal .students can not recognize facts accurately without the basic ideas and concepts .thus , i would like students to learn basic knowledge to understand facts .in conclusion , i believe that students should understand ideas and concepts first before learning facts .not only students but also adults can not understand facts without basic knowledge .if they do not have them , they would misunderstand the facts .this is not good for students .therefore i strongly reccomend students to study the basic ideas and concepts to recognize facts .
