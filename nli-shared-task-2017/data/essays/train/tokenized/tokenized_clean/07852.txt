cars have different meaning for different individuals .for some its a neccessity , an object insperable .for others its a status symbol , an object that expresses their power , success and wealth .what ever might be the perceptions , a car is surely one of the most fascinating objects created by man .when henry ford invented the car , he did not fathom how important it will become in our daily life .the demand is high and the number of cars being added on the roads is increasing at a dramatic rate .in the developed countries as compared to the developing countries this rate is much higher .some countries take it positively as its an evidence of their economic prosperity .more cars on the road implies more earning power for a common man .however , lately the opinion has been changing as people are starting to realise the adverse effects that are being caused due to cars .one of them being traffic jams which are very common in large cities like new york , london or new delhi .a lot of time gets wasted due to this reason , as drivers get stuck in them .people have surely realised this problem and are preferring car pooling , buses or even bicycles as means of commuting .this means that in future there is a big possiblity of reduction of the number of cars on roads as the other mediums would mean reaching the destination faster .one other factor is noise and air pollution being caused by cars .this is a very big problem for people who live close to a main road where the density of cars is very high .on the other hand it is also a nuisance for the car drivers or the passengers as the pollution causes harm to their health .imagine , monday morning when everyone goes to work , the traffic jams and pollution start the day .this will surely lead to a decline in the number of cars .another strong reason could be the rising fuel consumption which is increasing the fuel prices .this is making people to look out for alternative mediums to travel .this will surely lead to a decrement in the number of cars as people would prefer buying a buss pass which would prove to be lighter on their pockets as compared to purchasing fuel for their cars .even if an alternative cheap fuel is invented , increase in traffic jams and pollution will definitely lower the number of cars .finally , the number of accidents being caused by cars are inreasing day by day .due to this reason people are preferring trains and buses which are comparitively safer .all the major reasons mentioned above will surely bring a drop in the number of cars , and twenty years down the line we can expect fewer cars in use than there are today .
