many old people think that they do not enjoy life as the did when they were younger and they generalize this opinion to hold that young people ejoy life more .i do not completely disagree with this statement .particularly , i think it is not that young people enjoy life more , but they enjoy it in a different way .usually , young people do not know much about adult responsabilities yet .this is why they can feel more secure and to feel they have a lot of time to modify things and attitutes .besides , a feature of young people , especially teenagers , is the way feelings are taken to exagerated extremes ; they love or hate , but there is no in between .as they do love , it is a fact that teenagers can also suffer a lot .it is well known how easily problems come up when we are young .tiny problems can be a complete tragedy in minutes .on the contrary , older people can see these problems jus as superficial , and they are more likely to enjoy of basics things of life .for example , a bad experience in a new group of people such a class can make a young person quit and to think that he or she will not join this group never again .from another perspective , someone that had experience that this kind of situation can happen ( and will happen ) many times in life , will accept itto summarize , i think we need to consider that young and old people have different perspectives of life , due to different experiences , which leads them to see life in a different manner .when people state that youger people enjoy life more , it is based on the feeling that their attituded towards life is more calm and not as passionate as when they were younger .
