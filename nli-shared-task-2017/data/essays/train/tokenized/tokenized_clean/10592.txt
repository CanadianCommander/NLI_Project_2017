these days , there are lot of exsitding place around here and there for young people such as ammusument parks or playing some sports .but at the same time , there are lot of amazing place for older people .therefore i do not agree this statment .i have two reasons for it .first , i think it is much different that the point which young people likes and the point which older likes .for example , for young people , they really like to go skiing , but for older people it does not matter .it means , they do not feel attraction about that .on the other hand , for older people like to go to the place there are hotspring .but for young people , there is no value to go there .in my opinion , now they are equall .second , it is natural that older people has more money than young peolpe does .therefore older people can spend mucc money for their fun even if they can not have enough time to go somewhere because of their children .they can buy their favorite dvds , and enjoy by watching them at home .lastly , even though they can not go outside whenever they want to go because they are mother at house , they have more time to do their favorite things rather than young people who has to go to school everyday .therefore i think older people can enjoy their life more freely than young people do .
