trying to guess what is waiting for us in twenty years is not an easy task and making an accurate forecast is almost impossible .nevertheless , we can try to analyse the current situation to guess what is to come in twenty years as far as cars are concerned .during the last fifty years , there has been a constant increase in the number of cars , and when we consider the new markets like the chinese one , with more than one billion people , we may think that yes , there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today .nevertheless , other points are to be taken into consideration .the demand is increasing , but can we really supply that demand ?and more precisly , can we fuel all these cars ?our fuel supply are slowly but inevitably decreasing , and prices are getting higher and higher .this is why we will have to find new solutions to be able to reach the demand .solutions are being developped , and with the fuel prices rising , there are getting more competitive .some cars are already powered by ` eco-fuel  , made from plants like beet for instance .these new fuels are told to be less dangereous to the environment and are pretty efficient .obviously , they are only part of the solution and not the solution , but with this example , we see that alternatives already exist .this is why i think that in twenty years , there will be more cars than today .people want cars and the technology is there to make sure will be able to get these .i actually believe that this is just an economical problem : when the fuel price will rise enough and corporation will see that they can make money with new technologies , they will .as a conclusion , i would say that yes , there will be more cars in use in the future thant there are today , nevertheless , these cars might be really different than those we are using nowadays .
