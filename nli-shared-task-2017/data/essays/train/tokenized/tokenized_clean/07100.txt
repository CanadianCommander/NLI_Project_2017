the term success leads to encourage the people to try new things for the better growth and fame to the individual and the organistaion too .i agree that successful people should have a great deal of energy and courage to do find for the new ideas and plans , which obviously leads to take certain risks .but these risks also count worthy when the goal is achieved .a successful person always tend to move forward to get even better prospects for him , this helps him to try out new things rather than sticking to the one already been engaged .doing the old job or already know thing is that something leads to a confined life , which is not always followed by a person of succsess .the person should try out risks to handle the situation even better , and also letting the know things is not a wise thing to do .we need to try out new things and relatively try for better ones , that helps to get work even simpler and better .there is a element of risk in every job which we handle , but the risk should be overcomed by the proper steps and skill that we have , need to be wise and genious in handling the risk , else it will eventualy leed to distractions in the life .however , the risk element is encountered in trying new things it can be easily digested when we acheive the goal we aimed at .successful person always try for the new ways of thinking and re-establishing himself/herself in a better rennovated position .sucessful person always try for the more success and this makes him to try for new things to develop .we know that failures leed to the success one day or other , but success ultimately try s for a better success .for example , if a person acheived 70 % in his first attempt , he tries to improve it by changing the course of studying , he works harder and better to reach more then 70 % in his next attempt .in this example , he tried some new ways to held himself motivated to improve the grades by an improvised study .finally , i suggest that a successful person become more success in every aspect if he tries new things rather than confined to they already know well .the person of a high caliber can always handle the amount of risk with ease , when risk is eliminated it all in our hands to do better for the success of the new aspects or things which we do .right thiking at the right point of time , always leeds to a better success .so , its always encoured to try out for new deals to helps things better in life .successful people always strive hard for the better success , for better success we need to switch on to new things .if the new things clicks he/she becomes more popular and reach the goal aimed at .
