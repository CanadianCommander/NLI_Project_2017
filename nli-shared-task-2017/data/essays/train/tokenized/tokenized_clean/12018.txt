everyone in this life wants to live more so i think that we should enjoy our time in living our life .so i agree that young people enjoy their life than older people .we know that when we are young we enjoy our time in playing , studing and doing alot of thinges we can not doing now .there are several reasons of that , one reason that , when we were child we had the freedom in doing any things we need , also we had the power to live happy and interesting lifestyle , we could be lated for along hours .moreover , we had the health and the willing to reach to what we need , we could go for playing , singing with our friends , but when we come older we connot do this things because we have the new responsibility in our life such as , our children and the care which they need to become like thier parents .also , our power in enjoying our time became weak and we connot have the ability in working and enjoying , so we should let our children to have this intertainment and let them live their life , because when we are in their age we did alot of thinges which reminds me now .so you should live your life by having some of exicting and enjoyment .all in all , we can not stop the time , and we should convince in our distiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our life , and this will not prevent us to try to complete our lives in thinking about the history which we had lived from the young .
