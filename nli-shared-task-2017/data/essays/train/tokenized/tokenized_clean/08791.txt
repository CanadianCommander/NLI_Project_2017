the speed of development concerned technique is so fast today , and more and more speculate that what will happen in 20 years .some of them believe that there will be few cars in use than there are today .however , i is hesitant to agree with the statement , and the reasons are listed below .let us have a look at the increasing wealth brought by the globalization , we will agree peopel will own more fortunate than have ever been .the increasing money will be spent on some goods which seemd to be luxury before , including cars .take china as an example , more and more family boast cars now , which was a miracle to them before .if we pay some attention on the soar earning of people in africa today , we all agree the conlcusion that they tend to buy more cars just as what chinese are doing today .moreover , i also believe that people in developed coutries will not give up using cars ; since the vehicles bring us such a lot of convenience .for example , we can easily travel to places for which we are longing by driving them .besides that , they also increase the independence and freedom of people , who wll not be restricted by location and weather .and i am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being , cars will become more popular .admittedly , many people think that the number of cars will be reducing , because they cause a great deal of pollution , and people nowdays pay special attention on the enviroment .nevertheless , i deem that the pollution of cars can be reduced and finaly varnish , with the development of techniques .and we will confirm this idea through statistics provided by un , that a car made by the newest technique pollutes less than has even been before .in conclusion , though the cars face the problem that they pollute a great deal today , i think the number will not be fewer , because more and more people can afford them , and such great comfor and convenience they offers , and , the most importan .the advancet of techniques .
