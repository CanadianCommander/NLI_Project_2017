i think that in twenty years there wo nt be fewer cars than there are today because of different factors as it can be tha growth of the population , the improvements of the technics or the globalization .the population is growing on every country because of the improvement in the sanity , technologies . ..that makes that the population growths also in the `` first world countries  so morew people will be able to reach a car .also , one of the main points is the improvement of the technology .maybe it can be thought that because of the polution or the non pollutions plans that the governments are trying to impulse in some years most of the people will change their cars for the public transport .because of that the car companies are investing money in evolute new green technologies like hidrogen batteries that will make possible to use a car without polutting , in fact you will creat just water instead of dioxide carbon that is really harmfull for our enviroment .in deed , that improvement of the technology will make cheaper all the proces of making a car , so there will be more people who will be able to obtain a car when before that improvement they could nt .and here is where the globalization get s in .all the old technologies that are not useful in the `` first world countries  will be sold on sale to those countries that are not that rich .in that way , countries where most of the people could nt afford a car , they will have cars reacheble .and that means more cars beeing used on the world .to sum up , i think that all the problems such as politics plans or enviromental pollution because of the use of petrol , will be resolved by the improvemnt of technology that is already known , such as hidrogen batteries as i told before .
