culture has to be very important for all people , it is better thet eachone know much information about differet argoment and topic .it is very beatiful study many academic subjects because you could discover much things that you do nt know .at same time i think that for working is better to specialize in one specific subject .for example before the last reform of school italian university give you many academic subjects and less specific subject , you study in university a lot of book and after university you do nt know the way for enter in word s job .for a students is very difficult understanding the applications of information in a jo .i think that the general academic subjects is important for myself and specific subject too .the best way for me to improve your culture and found a good job is that you have to learn very well all the informations that school give you and after that , during the work , this information have to use for do a good job .now italian university is building in a different way than the past .you study for 3 years many academic subjects ( many information about a different kind of disciplins ) and the and of this 3 yeas you have a degree of first level .after you decide if you continue your studies or not .if you continue to study you can choose one specialization and learn one specific subject for 2 years , during this time yuo at the and you have a degree of second level .in short i think that is better that i learn many academic subjects for improve my culture and my life at the same time i learn one specific subject for found a job that i like me .
