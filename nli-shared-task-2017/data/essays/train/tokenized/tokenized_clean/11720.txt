introduction : advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i believe that advertisements make products much better .advertisements plays a vital role in developing businesses .it is a part of business .now a days if we start watching tv we will watch more advertisements than what we are watching .it shows the the product much better than the reality then the consumer will get tempted they will buy immediatly .advertisements are every ware .suppose one company wants to sell babby products like toys , food , cloths they release the product by advertising .that advertisement shows that how much the product is usefull ?what are the results of the product .obviously they will shoe good results .they will target on the consumer needs .the product will sold .it often happens every eare not only the babby products .now a days people wants do buy new product they will go and watch advertisement for few days than only they will buy .it shows the popularity of the product .if the advertisement comes very often on one project people thinks that is good one .for example resturants wants to reduce prizes to gain the popularity they go and give advertisement on tv like they will show good pictures of food or they will create a little documentry .people get tempted and go to the resturants .media uses advertisement often to gain their popularity on thier tv channals .sopeople watch their channals .some times advertisement is very usefull like we can give advertisement on tv if any one is missingit is usefull in finding the products popularity also .now adays every one is using advertisements not in selling products or ganing popularityof channals .we often seen in elections also political parties use advertisements to gain popularity of their parties .these are the reasons i strongly agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
