i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .to begin my passage , i would like to provide my own experience happened in my home stay family .it snowed heavily last years in vancouver .when faced with such snow , different member in the family have totely different reactions .the homestay-father and mother thought it was a big mass to be cleaned up , they hate the snow .however , the child in the family , who was only seven years old , was very happy to see so , because she has never seen such heavy snow in her life .she can enjoy herself in the snow for a whole afternoon .why young people enjoy life more ?first , because they usually have less life experience .in such manner , they are more curious than adult .young people just want to try new things , even though older people may think it was bad .also they have less experience to see bad things .sometime , they do not have the ability to tell good things from bad ones , so they may engoy both of them .in addition , adult , older people , are usually under lot of presures , which are not only from daily work , but also from their families .they may think something was a trouble while their children think it is enjoyable to play with , just like the story above .last but not least , young people usually want gain different experience in life .they would like to discouver different things in their life .in this case , they may have more opportunities to approve interesting things in daily life .when meet these kinds of things , they can have more enjoyment , so young people enjoy that more than older ones .all in all , people of different age have different opinions to their life .but , in general , young people enjoy their life more than people of an older age .
