knowleges are the most important thing in everybody s life .we usually get them from school and  or from personal experiences .is it better for oneself s developpement to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?i would answer : yes , for several reasons .first , have you ask yourself the following question : why are we taught so many subjects at school ?the answer is clear : because the gouvernement has told to do so .it wants the best for the population .it gives you the opportunity to open your mind and `` taste  many subjects .second , with broad knowledge , you are more able to understand one s opinion or point of view .this is a great advantage in life , you will better understand the world and the persons you live with , but also you will be more understandable by others .third , have you ever experience a conversation with a specialist in a particular subject ?well , i do , and i found it very interesting at the beginning , but when i tried to change the subject of the conversation , i was faced with a real wall . ..specialists are really good at what they do , but seem to be a `` bit  narrow mindedas a conclusion , i realized that you ca nt have the same level of knowledge in one particular subject than in many ones .this is true , you have nt got the time to learn everything .in fact , you will agree or disagree with the statement based on your own values .in my opinion , i am sure that you can be a specialist in different subjects .for example : you can be a moviestar ( you are then a specialist in acting ) , and a famous and apreciated politic ( specialits in politics ) .i was thinking about arnold schwarzzenegger who has also taught how to be healthier in his early life .are there muscule trainings for the brain ?
