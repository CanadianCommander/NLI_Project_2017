we are going to find a diverse list of opportunities in our job , school or university , but the people has the option to choose what they want to do in order to reach the success in all the areas in the life .first of all i preffer to be a person that always is looking for challengin tasks and have the option to risk and looking for reach my goals .i think that is an excelent idea to try to find new things in our life like try to be promoted in my job or try to take more classes in the university instead to be in the same position for the rest of my life , i do not want to be the same person that you meet ten years ago and in the same job .although a lot of people do not like to take risks and never give themselves the good experience of improve theirs skill only because they fell scared of change or they think that have lack of capacity or qualities to do any specific task that you can make .everybody in this world have the capacity to learn , and we never must to stop to learn new things , because in the future this could be helpful in any situation and also will give you a list of advantages for the rest of your life .for example i knew person that he asked me , what kind a job do you like ?and i my answer surprised him because he was focused to work in a job that always is doing the same and he told me that he was affraid to make a mistake in a job that have to conduct different tasks each day and also he did not like the idea to be a person that always have to take decisions .for me is very important try new things so i will learn new skills all the time , i am not scare of make mistakes because i can put this mistake in my list of experiences ; and i always learn of my mistakes because i do not want to have the same mistake again .
