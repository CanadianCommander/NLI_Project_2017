i am agree to the statment because i think too that the succesful people is the people who try new things and take risks , but i think that it is nt the only reason to say to this people succesful .i think that you need more than this statment .the people succesful is the people that believe in his own , and this peopla have a lot of goals in his head , and do anything for obtains all the things propouses .this peoples known that they have the possibility to do the changes of the things only if they have theirs knowledges in minde , they know who they are . ..and know that they could be if never disapoint .for example .an student wants graduate and he wants study anrchitecture , it s a dream .now , what can he does ?ok , this it s simple .he have had aptitudes and abilities for the carear , he should want study and never leave his dream .but not only the road finish here .he should take the decition of be responsable , and be intelligent to dominate all the information .the student had to start to have more relations with people of his carear , this pont is because not only you should be intelligent for this project , you have to findding the wat to obtain a good job .he had a goal for obtain , and he continues in the knowledge process to be the person who he wants to be .other example could be a famous people like an actor who win an oscar .he feel exciting for obtain a goal .all the days we find many people like that .the succesful people take a lot of risks because they know , they can do that and all the things they want to do .this people can be anypeople , but this person shold be take the decition to do something for change and something to grow ever .the world is in hands of successful people !people with dreams , people with risks , people with posibilities to grow .they have a lot of fight for , they have a goal , they have a plan .they do nt know the fear and they give to the world the best of theirself .all the persons would try to give the best of
