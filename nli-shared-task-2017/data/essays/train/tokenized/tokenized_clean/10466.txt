the situation and responsabilites of young people has been always a major topic in social issues .the limits of the latter has been changed according socio-political conditions of each country or society .nowadays , debate abount young people help attitudes towards their community is growing .advocates of this argument claim that although a deep understanding about social collaboration and establishment of non-profit social organizations dedicated to help others is growing , young people do not choose to be a part of this life style .they argue that they waste their time by some other kind of activities .however , this approach can be critised by claiming that our lives is not strictly determined by our free choices .as i mentioned before , the environmental conditions in which a young person is located is extemely determining in his  her attitudes .to exemplify this , we can consider a country where you have no social rights such as free education or health insurance and where you have to work hard to afford life expanses .a young member of a poor or even a middle-class family will not have sufficient time to study , to work and to be part of organizations which are devoted to help people .considering education and earning money as two main obligations of survival in capitalist system , there is no time for involving in social organizations .one further exemple of the importance of social conditions in young people choices is the situation observed in extrene conditions like war .in times of war , there is an immense need for helping other people and whole life get a new direction according to demands of other .after taking account all this arguments , i can tell without hesitation that i strictly disagree witk the statement claiming the lack of charity behaviour of young population towards their communities .
