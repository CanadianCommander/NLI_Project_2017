the youth of today has forgotten its responsibility towards its community .while there are young people who are willing to help their communities , we see that the number of such people is rapidly declining .there are many reasons behind these actions though not all of them are the fault fo today s youth .one reason that young people of today are less willing to give time to helping their communities is the increase in competition in our lives .we see that there are many pressures on the youth of today to perform well in their lives , whether it is at jobs or in educational institutes as the competition for good job oppurtunities has greatly increased over the years .thus we see that young people generally prefer to spend a lot of time trying to improve their own value in the job market through extra courses and projects and , thus , have lesser amount of time to devote to helping out with their communities .as we can observe there is a sharp decline in the number of people who are willing to participate in activities such as collection of clothing for the poor and recycling paper believing that they have other demands on their time .another important factor is that with the growth of mass media and communication technology we see that their are many entertainment establishments that are constantly trying to gain the attention of the young people of today and tend to distract them from their responsibilities .for instance , consider a new cinema or bowling alley which has recently opened .it will offer many enticing discounts in order to attract customers .one can easily imagine how tempting his would be to the people .a youth , given the fact that this is a short-term offer would generally choose to postpone any community service that he or she had planned to avail this offer .when choosing between volunteering at an old-age home and watching the latest movie at one-third the cost most people would choose to go to the movie .however , as the number of entertainment centres grow , these enticements also grow distracting the youth from their obligations to their community .furthermore , we see that in many countries corruption and lawlessness are so abound among the upper reaches of the administration that the youth get frustrated in their efforts to help with their community .hence , we see that many young people are demoralized and decide to pursue only their own personel interests than to attempt to help the community .for example , students who take up an enviromental initiative to plant more trees , may find that the plot where they had planted the trees has been sold for construction of an office building .in order to get the youth of today interested in their communities there is an active need for the administrators of the company to provide them with support and encouragement .in conclusion we see that the youth of today has become more frivilous about its responsibilities and does tend to ignore its duties .however , there are various factors which have led to this behaviour among the young people .we should not condemn their actions without fully appreciating the enviroment in which they live .
