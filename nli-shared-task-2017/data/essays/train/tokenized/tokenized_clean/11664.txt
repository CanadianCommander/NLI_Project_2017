people should help communities because human beings are the part of society .today , it is hard to find young people who help their communities because they are busy doing their own things .therefore , i agree young people do not give a lot of time to helping other communities because they are busy for preparing the furture life and not be educated by adults about helping others .first , today s life is hard to live doing work and studying hard .young people usually concern about their future for going to good school , doing well in school , having a part time job and getting a good job .our society focused on doing well in school and work rather than educating them to have to help others .for instance , when i was in college , i was asked to study english as a second language in order to have a good job .all day long , i stayed in the library and studied to get a good job .i even did nt have time to hang out with friends .i could not have time to think about others because life is tough in my side .secondly , adults like parents and teachers ask young people to work hard and study hard .they always pointed that life is hard and people should prepare in advance before they regret .when young people are attending classes , they do not have enough time to think about others and teachers do not mention the points that people should help first rather than doing own things .for example , i never met teachers who said about helping communities are important of our life or showing voluneer work by themselves .my parents only worked and my teachers taught their classes .in short , i strongly agree with the idea that young generation nowadays do not give time to helping their communities because they only focus on preparing their future life and are not educated by adults about helping communities .
