i disagree to the statement which promotes having better knowledge in many subjects than to specialize in a specific one .the famous quote `` jack of all trades and master on none  very appropriately supports my opinion .yes , nature has made everone equal and their is no difference whatsoever in our capabilties .what however distinguishes one man from another , are his qualities & deeds .although god has gifted us all with similar capabities , he has also blessed us with different interests & talents .i believe that one must specialize in a specific subject to form his own identity .today s soceity is appreciative of selectively skilled personelle , who add to the growing global economy .a highly skilled person is welcomed to relocate in most developed countries .this leads to upgradation of class & pay .such skilled perons take back to their country additional waetl what one person could achieve effortlessly could be another s nightmare .this difference may not be only attributed to skill .interest in a particular activity substantialy makes the person more keen & happier to do a job .this keeps the pressure off him and makes his achieve to the best of abilty .imagine a world with no specialists .do we settle for opinions about a fracture from an orthopedic surgeon or would we take a general physician s word as final for it ?would a plumber be as good if he fixed your electrical fittings as well ?am sure the answer would be `` no  .being a doctor , i have read through vast syllabi of human anatomy , physiology & biochemistry , about the basis of pharmacology , pathology , medicine , surgery and gynecology .though a broad knowledge of all these subjects has helped me understand the basis of origins and functioning of various body systems & their anamolies , i would consider my education incomplete without the specializaton in a particular branch .we all have unique interests and it is impertive to take up one in order to thrieve in the todays  highly competetive work environment , where merely having a broad knwoledge is considered a basic skill and we compete with work force trained in specific tasks .a person s interest in a specific field keeps the drive to achieve higher & specialize in his subject of interest .
