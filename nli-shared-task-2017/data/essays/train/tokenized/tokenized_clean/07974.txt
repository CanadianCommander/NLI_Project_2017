there are many modes of transportation avaliable to the modern person such as planes , ships , boats , buses , trains , the underground metro , but cars remain the primary mode of transportation for many people who are commuting everday in urban and subarben areas .i disagree with the previous statment that says that car use will decrease , for i believe that with time , the amount of cars in use will continue to increase .firstly , the population inhibiting the earth continues to grow year by year .these people will evidently need to move from one place to another and therefore find the purchasing and use of a car as a good solution .we also find that the average consumer may buy more than one car , for they can afford it .if you are ever stuck in a traffic jam , you can plainly see the amount of cars out there is increasing .looking closely , you will also find that these traffic jams are getting worse every year .secondly , the more people there are , the greater the demand for cars , and this will lead to an increase in production of cars .we can plainly see that the manucaturing of cars has not decreased but is increasing year by year .infact , this is a very competitve market with a varity of products aimed at different consumers .from the busy soccar mom , needing a large and reliable car , to the rich business man ready to cruise in his expensive european car .this market , is infact getting larger since the time of ford model-t , and will contine to grow with new designes produced every year .thirdly , there are many countries currently trying to enter this ever expaninf market .for example , there are many chinese cars infiltrating the market and this is a new advancement never seen before .there are also countries that manuacture car parts , such as moracco , and this production is likewise increasing .it is apparent that the production and use of cars will continue to increase year by year .unless these are new techonlogical advancements that can replace cars and are cost effective , thus avalible to the average consumer , we can be sure that cars will not decrease in number any time soon .
