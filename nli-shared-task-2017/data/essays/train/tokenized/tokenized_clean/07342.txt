homenkind always need success to reach good life standards therefore succes is a very important aspect of human life .everyone has different point of views about the idea of being successful .some assume that , trying new things and taking risks is better than making what they do well , in contrary to those some assume that , doing what you already how to do well is better .i personally agree with the first idea .these are my following reasons .firstly , success is related with gaining new experiments and making new changes .everyone needs to change and must develop their self .for devoloping and advanceing , sometimes people takes lots of risks .because when you are trying a new and unmaked thing you can loose your other qualifications .i think that , a successful person should be creative .for that reason , these people should make new experiments that others ca nt do .because they have ability and they are capable to do this .history is full of with those courages people .in addition , successful people should be hardworking and persist .they should always want to invent new things and should always be inclined to changeing .for example , there are lots of scientists in the history that they established the worlds unknown rules .we can give albert einstein for an example .when he was at school he was nt a perfect and brillant student .just because when he was at he classroom he always has thinked about the worlds existance any any other unpublished stuff .after years he discovered lots of things about thhe enviroment and he became one of the most well-known scientist in the history .the last but the least , when anybody changeing his or her expertise , he or she takes a lot of risk .if people attend to discover new things , they sould educate other people around them and share their informations about their expertise .furthermore , when you are trying to make a new thing in many ways you should delete your ex-career .also , in your new direction you may not get succed .in that position you might loose your respect , money and selfconfidence .on the other hand , if you succeed then you would be more valuable member of your community .all in all , as i said before successfull people should try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .i hope humankind does nt disregard what i mentioned .
