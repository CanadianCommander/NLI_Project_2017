since the last century , the world has been undergoing a globalisation movement .capitalism has spread over the planet and new societies considered as individualistic has been settled down .more and more people seems to be more interested in their own success , their own life than in what could occur in the society .but can we say that people , or especially young people are not interested or involved anymore in community problems ?saying that young people are not interested in helping the community would be a wrong statement .it just has to be considered that to help the community you have to know what is needed and where you can do it .young people of today are often students , but also sometimes young workers or unemployed people .these are three differents status that does not offer to intergrate the community in the same way .most of the students are involved in their community life within activities in their schools or universities .young workers have to work more on it with discovering associations and community services by themselves .unemplyed young people are often already in contact with community associations .
