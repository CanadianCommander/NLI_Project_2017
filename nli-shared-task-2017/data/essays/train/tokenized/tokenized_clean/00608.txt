i clearly disagree with the statement .fistr of all because the car is an essential method of transportation .people use the car for everything ; for working , going shoppping , travelling , etc .it is true that the cities are getting saturated of cars and the public transport is the best way for moving inside the cities , but people are also moving out to suburban areas where the public transport does nt reach .these families have to use the car for picking the kids at college , going to the mall , or even to buy the bread .we are turning into a a society that does nt walk , we use the car for everything .this is mainly because we do nt live in the city where we have all types of services and supplies just down the corner .secondly , the car manufacturers are making cheaper cars every time that can meet the economical possibilities of people who colud nt afford a car years ago .these cars are also cheaper to mantain and more reliable .i just bought a car last year and the first mantainance check is after twenty tousand miles , when my previous car had to be checked every seven thousand miles .the only challenging point of view is the duration of the `` petrol era  .the humanity is using up all the petrol ; planes , cars , boats , industries . ..they all need petrol to function and the resources are limited .there will come a day when there will be no more left and the engines will not run any more .but the car industry has done researches for new sources of energy that are clean and , best of all , unlimited .this will promote the use of the car , nowadays a little bit pinpointed due to the contaminating effect they produce .
