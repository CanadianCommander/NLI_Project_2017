i do agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .world is moving rapidly towords technalogy .people now are getting tierd of cars .because first they are very expensive to buy .second , a person spends alot of money for petrol .roods are very busy .cars brings alot of damege for exaple acidents that kills people .the smoke that comes out of the car brings alot of damge to your health .technalogy moves really fast .from now untill twenty years alot of thimgs are going to be invented like insted of driving in the rood people can fly with their own plans .alot of other ways of transportation are going to be used .people now use trains or the under ground trains .alot of countries now use trains or motorcycle insted of cars do to the grown of their poupolation .i think people can manige to live without cars .one hundred years ago people used to transport by animals such as horses or camils .do to techanolgy i think that people will invent something that doesnt do harm for people .a person wont think that after twenty years any thing will change , because its only twenty years , but the fact is that twenty years are alot for a person to invent something .how long did it take for a man to invet a space chip ?not more than twenty years .my point is that alot of people no what is good for them and what is bad , even if they didnt notice it emidutly .with no time there will be something insted of cars that people can use to transport with it in much easier way ,
