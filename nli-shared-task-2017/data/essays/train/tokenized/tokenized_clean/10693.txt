i think it depends how you want to travel and where are you going ? .when i go with my family i prefer to travel without having a tour guide .and also if i want to see some specific places or visit some friends .because when you go with a group which are ledding by a tour guide , you have to do what the guide says , and you have to go where the guide goes .and sometimes i prefer to do what i want at the time that i want .usually this kind of traveling [ by a tour guide ] it can be a little bit boring , even more if you do not understand what does the guide is saying .and also it could be tired .for example there is a schedule in this kind of trips .you have to wake up early in the morning otherwise the guide and the group will leave and they wo nt wait for you .and then you have to do what it says in the ittinerary .of course if you want to know different places , for example europe and you go with a group with people in your age , i think it could be really funny and great .because at the time you are knowing new places , knowing about different cultures , you are making new friends .and in this case you do not waist so much time looking for the places or asking where to find what you are looking for .also in this kind of trips you know more places in less time .because they already know the important places and the routs that we should take .i agree , fortunately i did this way to travel twice and i will do it again if i have the oportunity .any way of traveling is good , of course if it is for fun or culture .
