people often think that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do .i personaly disagree with this statement .i strongly believe , as i myself get older , older people enjoy life more than younger people because of the difference in experience time the one has spent .first , old people tend to live selective life from their experience .although this seems not very exciting , as younger people always looks so , the scale of `` enjoying life  is way higher .for example , i often go to hot springs with my wife for vacation .i never thought of going to just take a bath taking hours of time in a car to reach the location when i was in teenage .but after all the experience that i visited several hot springs , i know the wellness of it .now i know it is very relaxing and comfortable to just be there , i never offend using my time for transportation to that location .as i saw the hot spring for the first time , it was very exciting but never felt that it was enjoyable .since i have more experience , with hot springs , i choose to go there rather than the situation i happened to be there .i feel that i am selecting choices of events based on the experience how well you can enjoy .for the younger people , as i recall my younger age , they often look joyful only by the excitement from the first or rare experience of events .i was enjoying very much playing with my tv games , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , straight .i was excited to become better at the games and talk about it in schools , at that time .after all that excitement and experience , i never play tv games .now i choose not to do whatever will not my life better in terms of living life .i learned from the full-time game player experience .now i am confident in spending my time for goods of myself .in conclusion , as i pointed out above , i totally believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .i definitely think that i am selecting what is good for my life and i am enjoying my life a lot better than my younger ages .
