knowledge is more important than work .knowledge improves ur skills , ability to do work .to get a knowledge mainly by doing practical things .knowledge plays a important role in every student .it is a essential thing to every human .to get get knowledge we read different books and by practical application .i think tht to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important .because knowing to all the subjects we have a greater idea among all subjects .it is applicable to undergraduate level .i suggest tht why it is imp to study or get knowledge from all things tht we have a idea what will happened in our surroundings or in the society .if u do a job it is not only connected to ur subjects but also to other llike how to manage a problem if u faced , and how to communicate with the other people .it is not only related to ur subject it also related with other subjects .upto under graduate level u will study or have a knowledge from many other subjects .it is useful to study a single subject means to say tht specialization it is important in graduate level .in the undergraduate level u must get the knowledge from teachers .in that level u just know tht how this problems has effects ? .how to solve the problems .to get more details about tht topic teachers help and to teach u.they want to train u how the details should be included to ur answer .by knowing the the all subjects it wiil help to increse ur knowledge .but in graduation level u u need not want u train by the professors .at this time they want to preapare for their own .att this level speciualisation is important .i want to conclude tht it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important .i think tht it is more impotant in the undergraduate level .to get the ideas from many subjects this is important while doing jobs and we shift to other countries or places to know the knowledge about tht is so much helpable to us .by dont getting the knowledge from all subjects it does not help , and also any subject it does not deals only tht topic it is interrelated with all other toppics .so i conclude that get knowledge from all other subjects is important .in the undergraduate level .
