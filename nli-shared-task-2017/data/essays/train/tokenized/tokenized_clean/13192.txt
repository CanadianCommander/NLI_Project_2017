i m afraid i disagree with the statement .with the development of the first world , it comes the confortable way of life , which has the car as one of its key elements .despite there are already movements of people who recall using alternatives , such as bycicles , or public transport systems , the most of the population still resists to refuse to the comfort , speed , and freedom of a car .many developed countries are dealing nowadays with this problem .london , is a good example , closing its historical center to the private traffic , or making the citizens interested in driving inside pay a special task for it .if this examples spread , perhaps in some years we will be able to change , or reduce , this general practise , perhaps we could be aware of the importance our environmet has and begin saving energy and reducing pollution .but , even if that happens , there will be a second world waiting for having the chance for developing in the same way our first world did .we already can see this phenomenon : north african industry systems do nt follow kyoto rules , as they fell like having the same freedom as the former industrial countries had , concerning air pollution , for instance .this is a complicated task , as in one side the trade system benefits of this industry , much cheaper than the one in first world countries but , in the other hand , if we allow it , we will have worse environment conditions , and we do have developed the technology
