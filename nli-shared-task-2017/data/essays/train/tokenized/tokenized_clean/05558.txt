i feel reasonable that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .for example , if we need to get information for trip , how can we make a plan .we looking for good hotel , best view place , famous sightseeing spot , good local reastaurant , and how to get there etc . ..we needtour guide can give us all of the information we need .they are specialist for getting information about sight seeing .it is very easy to get a lot of information for us .of courase the plan made by specialist never wasted time for trip .second , the most of travel tour make a group for same purpose .this is very important things for good trip memories .we can get friend with just join tour guide .the friend who is made in trip can always make you happy rather than alone trip .in addition , group tour promise lower price anywhere than visiting alone .because specialists got group discounts of ticket , food , hotel anywhere .third , the trip with tour guide is safety .there are a lot of travelers who injured , geting sick and trouble .the most of the reasons is a lack of knowledge of local rule , place and manner .sometimes so hard to understand the behavior of local people especialy related religion customs .tour guide job is safety trip .they always notice safe way and information for our safety .they never take you to get possibility of dengerous .thus we should understand how easy to get good safety trip with resonable price .we should know the trip without tourguide is waste money and time .
