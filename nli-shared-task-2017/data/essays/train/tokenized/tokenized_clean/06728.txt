it is very difficult to think about a situation in the future like this , thus it is impossible to state undoubtly an opinion infact one should only try to imagine a situation .after thinking about this statement , i do nt believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ; instead there will be at least as much car as there are today .i am not sure of that but i try to prove my opinion with some supporting points .first there are nt reasons for thinking the cost of new cars will increase and thus there will be fewer people wanting to purchase new cars .infact the car factories in the industrialized part of the world produce an amouont of cars that has been constant since specialized robots , meccanization and automatione were developed .secondly , think that in the cars of next generation hidrogen will be used in the cars instead of oil , also with the purpose of make possible a decrease of pollution .in this ways new cars moving by hidrogen will be promoted and a lot of people will want to buy one .
