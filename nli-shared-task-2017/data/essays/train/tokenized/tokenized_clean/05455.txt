advertisement , as a typical factor of this commercial society , can keep working because of it can make things better than they really are , so people will decide to buy the products .in my opinion , changing covers , announcing a new verison , and using famous super stars are three ways for advertisements to make them look much better than they real are .the covers make them look unique , professional , and beautiful .but what will happen if people get used to it ?the fancy cover wo nt attract people anymore .so at this time , they will chance their covers .for an example , coca cola , as a very popular and traditonal soft drink of america , has changed its cover for so many times , but it did nt really change the drink itself .the new covers will let people think , maybe it might taste better .the new covers bring people a new mood , which is invisible .a new version is another way of advertisements .when people get used to use something , they will lost their interests .so a new version of the product will coming out at this time .it does nt mean the product is still the old thing , but no one knows exactly how much the productor changed it .for example , there are so many kinds of shampoo say they are the second verison , but only professional analytists would know how much they really changed , and how much different will be made .the third way for the productors to sell more their products is to use make the famous guys , such as singers , movie stars , or even the president .the effects of the famous people are huge .first , if someone is a fan of a movie star .he or she might buy the product without any reasons .second , most super stars have good-looking faces .even the product is not the reason that made them look good , cosumers might be affected .so they think at least they might become beautiful .so in conclusion .the most advertisements use verision , cover and super stars to confuse people .so they can use these ways to hide the real value of their products , and sell more of them .
