there is not doubt that whether young people enjoy more than old people do has become more controversial in today s modern socity .as a matter of fact , this issue deals with a lof of different aspects .specifically , there are no universal answers to this question .depending on different elements such as social influence , personal interest , education background and etc , the answers of different people may vary greatly .as far as i am concerned , i vote that yong people do not enjoy life more than old people .in the following paragraphs , i would like to explicte my view from several perspectives .in the first place , the important reason in support of my view is that young people encounter more or at least the same amount of the physical problems than the older people do .both scientifc study and empirical experience show us that physical problems are in propotional to the technologies levels .therefore , with these problems , young people have to deal with these new problems before they can enjoy their life , namely , they will not have the same opportunies to enjoy life .for example , with the internet invention , young people have to deal with all the techincal problems in constrcting the network or in maintaining the network .but , for those older people , they can enjoy their life without thinking how this new monster brings about the c .in the second place , young peole have to bear more social burdens than the olde people .social burdens manifest themselves in terms of social changes .for today s young people , let s say in china , the society is pentrating into an aging society .with one child policy , the country will say one young couple have to sustain at least four parents or their family members .accordingly , young people can not have much time to enjoy life as the older people do .in the third place , admittedly , young people could face more opportunites to leave a happy life , for example , the joy that internet brings us .some people , accordingly claim that the yong enjoy life more their older peers .here we part company .they igonre the important facts that the the appearance of internet is only the result of modern technologies .as a result , young people have to handle all the brand-new challenges that the older people are never facing .we can not lost sight of the obvious deficts that those people hold their conclusion .in conclusion , the topic that whether young people enjor life more than older people do will be continuously argued .however , as the comprehensive stuy discussed above , i can safely draw the conclusion that young people do not enjoyb life more than older people do .
