i disagree with the statement saying , `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i believe in the other way around stating , `` it s better to specialize in one specific subject rather than go for many academic subjects .i am going to provide some of my personal experiences with specific examples in the passage .personally , i feel i have been off track since my schooling as i needed to go for many academic subjects .i used to have knowledge on various academic topics every year .once i got into higher studies , some of my subjects were of no use and i was made to stress only on certain subjects .from then on i never practically or theoritically implemented those subjects which i left off long way back .if i were to be specialized in any one subject i would have been a more knowledgeable person than i am today .secondly , having specialization in any one specific subject can build a person in a right way .the person could be able to make a research in the subject he learnt right from his childhood .it makes him more motivated and results in an obvious expansion of the subject whereas in having knowledge in many academic subjects could really limit a person s true potential and ability because there will be a time factor in this case and the person may not be able to make up the time for research purposes .finally , another advantage of specializing in one specific subject can make less burden on the children who are made to carry bundle of books daily to schools and colleges .studying only one subject can make this work a bit easier .more over the students can spend their time equally in theory as well as practical classes which is more important for a human brain to work efficiently .there must be more practical knowledge of the learnt subject rather than only book knowledge .the student must be able to apply what ever he learnt in his/her practical life .i would like to conclude by stressing my point that it is advisable to have knowledge in a specific subject rather than opting for many academic subjects .more over by specializing in any one subject of student s interest or choice , it helps development of research in vast educational field .there is more scope for individual development here .
