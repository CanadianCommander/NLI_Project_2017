i would definetly disagree with the statement .i say this because i am of the opinion that nobody is good at everything .students can not cope up with the pressure of learning and handling such vastly diverse knowledge .to have such a general base of knowledge with many subjects at once can bring in the effect of a student not being good at any of them .i agree that there are cases where some exceptional students might be good at many subjects , but thats not the general case .the general student can take only so much amount of knowledge .i believe that one must learn aleast one thing perfectly rather than half-learn a hundred things .in today s world of highly advanced technologies there is too much information and knowledge to learn and it becomes hard for student to master even one subject perfectly .such being the case , a broad array of subjects will only increase the strain on the student , which may lead for him to get confused about the actual subject that he is really interested in .for example , what good does a math student get from learning chemistry ?it will only put him through a lot of strain to learn a thing which he really is nt interested in .and i think it is really bad for students who have a focus in their life and have set goals to excel in a particular field , to have many academic subjects .it will only bring down their enthusiam and zeal to learn more about their favourite subject .and in events like when they fail to clear a subject which they dont like , they have to end up studying it all over again .this only adds to their stress and delay in trying to study what they actually want to study .also , people who get the oppurtunity to learn what they rally like will definetly excel in it .their brains will work better for the subject they like .and it will unfair to judge everyone by the same yardstick if we have many subjects .i mean to say that while some people will be good at one subject they might fare really bad at the rest .so u can not have a common benchmark as such , to judge their talents .and so i totally disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subjects rather than specialize in one subject  .
