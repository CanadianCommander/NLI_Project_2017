it is rather impossible to generalize and state that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .therefore , i cant wholeheartedly agree with the aformentioned statement .travel could be broken into multi categories that may include tourism , religious tourism , safaris and adventures , and business .the statement may work well for some kinds of travel but may unlikely be suitable for others .for example , honey mooners are not likely to be keen to travel within groups let alone having a tour guide with them most of the time since privacy is valuable and treasured by newly weds and even couples seeking to spend quality romantic times together .conversly , traveling for religious reasons may underscore the importance of traveling in groups led by guides .to further clarrify this point , piligrimage is a rather complex practice that may require traveling within groups as required by certain regulations and needs .that becomes clear in saudi arabia , where piligrims can not travel on their own to mecca in the hajj season ( piligrimage ) and they are required to travel in groups accompanied by tour guides who are more likely to be familiar with the hajj practices and terrain .additionally , people seeking adventures normally prefer to have their own itiniraries and most likley prefer to travel according to their own pace , plans , and preference .as an example , a tourist planning to climb mount evarest will unlikely wish to stick to groups and share common itinrary .managing cost may make travelling in groups more attractive especially that tour opperaters are capable to get attractive deals on larger groups .accordigly , this situation raises the issue of tour guides to maximize quality time spent and ensure that the group is exposed to the largest number of attractions .in conclusion , the arguments presented above make it clear that it is almost impossible to generalize that it is , indeed , the best way to travel is in groups led by tour guides .it is unequivicolly clear that the characterestics of people and reasons for traveling are so variabely distinct and different which only makes it incumbent on me to diasgree with the aformentioned statement .
