with the fast pace of development of human civilization , more and more people pay attention to the advertisements of prodects .presently , numerous people are willing to buy products based on the information delivered from the advertisements because the products seem appealing in these advertisements .however , from my own experiences , i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .recently , the products appear in advertisements become more and more attractive due to their well decorated appearence .people have the desire to buy things that look beautiful but at the same time , they will loss the awareness about how good the products will be .for example , i had bought a pair of sneakers because they are colourful and be placed in a delicated box .actually , they looked really good .however , the endurance of the sneakers was out of my imagination .i just had worn them twice and both soles were broken .unforturnally , i was cheated by the advertisement .sometimes , advertisement of the appearence of a product is not reliable .moreover , people will ignore some significant information if they completely believe advertisement .it is obvious that the manufacture will not show the disadvantages of their products in the advertisements and people have to observe the real quality of a product by their own .this is also the reason that many social organizations doing a variety of experiments on a single product in order to discover the secrets behind advertisement .actually , people need socialy authority to help them to choose products due to the immense unclear advertisements spread out in our society .conspicuously , the existence of this kind of organization helps customers to clearfy the some of the fake condition created by advertisements .to sum up , people should become aware about the advertisements they see and hear everyday because most of them contain fake and unclear information .if we accidentally trust a unreliably advertisement , the outcome is unconceiveable .
