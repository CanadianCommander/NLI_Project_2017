this question can be answered differently depending on the context we are speaking about : if we are looking at the professional environment , i tend to disagree with this statement , whereas as regards the personal life , i would rather agree with this asumption .fistly in the professional world , my opinion is that is it better to know deeply well a subject or a to be particularly performant in one specific competence , than to know how to do a little of everything !it is quite obvious , especially in big companies , that you are designed for a mission that people want you to perfom the most correctly as possible , and even better , to be really good in your specific job , impressive and reliable at the same time .it is useless to be capable of accomplishing some of the tasks of each service but do be unable to occupy a function in its totality .i do not have the same point of view concerning the personal life : indeed , i think that having broad knowledge of many subjects , either academic or cultural , is really more valuable and useful than having knowledge only in one or two particular fields .because all the time when you are speaking with people about all the subjects others than the one you are competent about , you look completely ignorant and stupid .however , i think that what every person tends to do inconciously is to focus on some subjects that raise her interest , and for which it requires less efforts to memorize information about .it even does not require any effort at all to learn things about something that anyway passionate you , it is rather a pleasure .one exaple in my personal experience is that i am fond of horseriding , and consequently know a lot of thing on my favorite hobby , but all this knowledge is one i meanwhile do not have on other subjects .the problem of knowing a lot of answers on a lot of different topics is a problem that i know well , as what i am trying to improve in my daily life is my personal broad knowledge .during the whole of my initial school training , that is to say until the french lycee , i completely disinterested myself of all the academic lessons that bring you with general knowledge , such as history , geography , litterature .to me , at that time , these lessons where of no interest in my daily life , but today i struggle to recover my lackings , because they are sometimes useful in the daily life , but rather more because now my interest finally waked up towards a lot of various subjects .also because travelling open the horizons , the spiritual and philosophical awareness , i hope i will have the opportunity to accumulate a lot of experiences in my future life , and that my children will have this chance too .it is really a trap , the fact to limit oneself to one s daily life and specialized professional task or context , and to stay in one s own routine .we should try to learn new things every day and to take initiatives , to take profit of all the treasures of life
