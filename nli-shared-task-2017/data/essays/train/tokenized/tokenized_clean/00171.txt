in this modern era of drastic changes of sceince and technology , young people play a predominant role .they really assimulate all their potential in interpreting their skills in different areas and strive hard in attaning their desired results .this young generation does not hinder any issues they have taken up and it shows their dedication and commitment in their work .nowadays , people are often engaged to their buzy schedules in making their future or in jobs and are less evident to their resposibility towards to communities they live in .buzy schedules may not be the prime cause of negligence but their are some more important issues to be considered like their might not be a truthful leader who can make them realise of their resposibilities towards the society .young people are the essence of a country s development .they are the future citizens who act as a role model for futher generations to come when they are perfectly on a right path by the elders .this can make them more responsible towards their duties .one of the best examples like , last month a train accident occured in banglore , india . .as it was in the early hours thre was not any major helpline available but a bunch of boys who were engineers have taken the resposibility not only to call for the helpline but also taking up the necessary first ais measures available in the train .another example , when the katrina has hit the usa , basket ball teenagers organised a charity match between their fellow competitors and managed to gather about thirty thousand dollars for the victims .they have recieved many applauds for their tremondous work for the humanity .also young people of diiferent countries have taken up the responsibility of joining the relief camps and to help the victims .these dynamic people are really paying alot in terms of their service to the humanity .finally , young players nowadays are definetly working hard not only for themselves but also for the community inturn to the country .all they need is some kind of encouragement in carrying out their duties towards the community .
