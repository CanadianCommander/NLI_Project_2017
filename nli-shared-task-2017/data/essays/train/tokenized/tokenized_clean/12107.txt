not only korean tourists but also other asian tourists are notorious for very noisy group tours .in fact , many friends of mine have their summer trips in a group led by a tour guide .however , i think the real value of tour can be achieved by individual tour planning .first of all , a tour with personal planning gives a lot of lessons .i think a single trip is similar to a path of one s life .when i was a college students , i used to make a plan by myself .of course , it was very tough for beginning .however , as time went by , i got more used to get useful information and well-designed planning .during surveys of tours , i met many advisers from various fields .it also helped me to enhance my interpersonal skills .i still keep in touch with some of those people .as the old saying goes , people live and learn .secondly , individual trip can be more flexible .sometimes i see people who suffered from their tour with a tour guide .that is because they had to follow the group s schedule rather than their own preference .on the contrary , in my own trip , i could explore more various sites freely whenever i feel i need to spend more time in a specific place .when i had a two weeks backpack tour in europe , i stayed rome for a week .considering the overall trip period , it was significantly long period .if i had to follow a group tour s rule , it would nt be possible .in conclusion , i do nt think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i think it has more shortcomings than gains .for me , i prefer a individual tour with own planning to a boring group tour with typical routines .
