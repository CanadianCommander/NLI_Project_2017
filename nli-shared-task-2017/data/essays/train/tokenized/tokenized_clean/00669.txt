the issue of wheather understand the ideas and concept is more important than learn facts has been a long time disputed .and people are entitled to opinions .from my point of view , i strongly side with the later groups who believes learn facts are more inportant .there are numbers reasons to support this , but in the following passage i will only present the major ones .first of all , learnig the facts can let them to be a crativity learner .in this world , everything have two view sides : right or wrong .tt is important for you to choose which way you will do .it is optional but sometims you have to follow the patten rules .along the time changing the patten is always changing .if students just understant the ideas and concepts escept the facts , they wil do not know change when they meet the new facts .so learn facts is more important .becuse it can let them thinking what it is , and what we will do .second of all , learning facts can gain more knowledge , when you know how to solve this problems you will also thinking whether this pattern can slove this kinds of things .if it can not so what we will do , we will ask ourselves or any other people .lao zi , a chinese psychologist , once said : there have a teacher in any three persons .it means that everbody have the things that you need to learn , if we want to be a knowledge persons we need to asks and get the helps from other peoples .lastly , learning facts can you learn the communication ability , because when you learn the facts , you probably need to know more details about the facts and you can disscuse and improve that you said it is correct , so you need to explain you ideas to let other peoples know , it good for you to communicate and let you to be a welcome one to them .understant ideas and concept can only let you be a receiver but learn the facts can help you be a scholar , you need to think to improve what you say and what you think , be a crative lea
