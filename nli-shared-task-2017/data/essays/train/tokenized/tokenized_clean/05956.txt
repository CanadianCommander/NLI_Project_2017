i agree with the idea that it is essential for successful people to challenge new things and difficulties rather than only doing what they repeat same things which they know how to do .i have two reasons for my idea : growth and gaining more knowledge .it might be quite difficult for people to succeed some challenges because all success is surrounded by dificulties .when we can deal with difficulties , we can succeed .for example , when i was a high school student and i studied so hard every day beause i wanted to enter the famous university for my studying and for my future .at that time , it was so hard for me to do both going to the high school and doing to the secondary school for more studying at night .i thought i might give up entering the high level of university many times .however , finally , i could pass the exam and entered the famous university which my parents and i also longed for .along side , i realized that there are always difficulties for the success .wnen we achieve the goals and challenges , we can grow ourselves as well as get the best results .moreover , there are many risks for challenges such as whether i can pass the exam or not .additinally , we need to gain more knowledge for the success .if the person wants to be a doctor , he or she needs to study harder than usual students which go to common universities .to become a doctors , it is necesarry to study hard and gain the special knowledge beause they have a responsibility for all lives of patients .therefore , they always face with taking risks as well as the success as a doctor .in conclusion , it is clear that successful people always try to challenge new things , to grow themselves and seek for more difficulties .at the same time , they also take risks .it might seem to be hard , however , i think it is essential for people who want to succeed to challenge new things and take risks .
