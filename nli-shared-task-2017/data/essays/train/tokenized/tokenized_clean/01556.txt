i do agree with the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .there are four reasons show that it is benifitial to travel in a tour group .first of all , it is much more safer to travel as a group than by one  self .especially when people want to travel in different country , it is possible for them to get lost or get in troubles .if they travel in a group , since people can take care and protect each other , the opportunities of getting lost or even get ripped is very small which keep them having a wonderful trip .secondly , when travel in a strange country , there are too many things needed to be considered .sometimes , it will be exceedingly confused for people to figure out which way to go , what bus to take or even where to live .for example , once i went to the capital of china , beijing with my parents , it should be a wonderful trip for us , since we had no much time to get together .however , it took us almost the whole day to find a hotel to stay over night which we wasted time and energy .eventually , the trip was ended in a unhappy mood and everyone was so tried to even look around .threrefore , travel in a group and having a tour guide can make the trip more efficient and easy .thirdly , sometimes due to the misunderstanding of different culture , people who do not fimiliar about that culture may make mistakes .in addition , the mistakes can be very seriours that tourists may cause accident or hurt .however , having a tour guide can give tourists the best and most accurate suggestions and warns which provide them avoid making unnecessary mistakes .lastly , the tour guide always know the best place to shopping of presents for friends or tourists themselves .usually , tour guides will set up a day or particular time for shopping , since it is not only about shopping , it is also about the culture in that country or city .however , if people travel alone , they probobly may not find the cheapest and the best to shop .in conlustion , i think travel in a group led by a tour guide is a bright idea for saving money and energy , keeping themselves safe and having the most efficient and wonderful trip .
