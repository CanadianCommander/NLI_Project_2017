in the present scenario , we see how the youth is changing in their behaviour .they are more advanced and infact many people opine that the youth in this generation is degrading .the fact that young people of this generation are more advanced does not imply that they do not give enough time to helping communities .i certainly not agree with the statement ,  young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities  .some of the supporting examples are explained below .many young people form associations which volunteer in social activities like serving the needy , building homes for the old age and the orphans , bringing awareness about dreadful diseases and conducting health campaigns in the slums .they are the one who feel more responsible as a citizen of their country , in upliftment of their families .many young people give tutions to children to earn their living .this activity is in a way helping the children to learn more and be aware of the things happening .and thereby helping the society as it is popularly known that  today s children are tomorrow s citizens  .so the youth today is helping out in producing good citizens .i want to support my opinion by stating another example .a political association , ` lok parithran  ( which means empowerment of the humans ) , was formed by young graduates in my country .they campaigned in many villages and volunteered in many social activities .despite of hectic schedules , with several courses to learn and several projects to work on , the youth of this generation do spare time for thier communities .the young students have that zealous to do something substantial which makes them work effectively and spontaneously .they are the ` architects of the nation  .they play an important role in building their communities .
