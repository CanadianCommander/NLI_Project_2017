due to the current level where science has reached by means of content and achievement , it is obvious that you need to specialize in one particular area rather than dealing with different fields .in otherwords science has all its resources from the academic studies and subjects and moving them to a next level by means of continuing this progress for the commonwealth , we need to focus on one specific subject while being aware of the influences of the other related fields as well .when we consider the politics as an academical subject , we can not separate it from sociology or related social sciences .therefore we should be aware of the sociology in order to study politics as a science or an academic subject , however in order to be succesful in the related academic subject , this line has to be drawn very carefully by means of knowing where to stop .if we take a look at the people who are specialized in their academic subject , it is very common to see the examples of above model since all subjects in certain limits are effecting each other , sometimes supplementing , sometimes resulting in contradiction .on the otherhand the definition of any academical title requires very deep knowledge which should make our way into having a broad knowledge of one specific academic subject which we are specialized rather than dealing with different subjects .the professors in universities realizing academical studies is a good example to be considered at this point .but as discussed above we should not ignore the above model in terms of having at least a basic information about how the other subjects effect our study .history is also another factor to be considered in terms of comparing the examples .many sciencists had worked on particular academical subjects in order to progress themselves and accomplish their responsibility against the humanity by inventing different devices , offfering different thesis which are still lightning their followers .such as edison , einstein and many others are good examples of this heritage .consequently the academical subjects has to be handled one by one or specifically in order to be more innovative and useful for the humanity .in my opinion , past is the best mirror supportting this approach .
