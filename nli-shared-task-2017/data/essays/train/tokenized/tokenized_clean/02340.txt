nowadays it is quite difficult to answer such a question as we all live in very hard times .first of all , i would say that , as being a young person , it is quite more easy for us to enjoy life as nowadays everything is possible .our grand fathers had not even the half of what we have today , meaning that the range of possibilities have largened .it is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fighting at war .several times my own grandfather told me this so i would realise the chance we have .secondly , i think this is so not to compare as we have totally other leisure times because of our age .by this , i mean that for instance , a younger one will enjoy doing a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someone older wo nt enjoy it as it means to much trouble and moving all the time .also it is not true to state that we , being younger , enjoy life more than elderly people as we do nt have the same meaning of enjoying life .for me it could be reading books while for another it would be boring to do so .this means the same for elderly people .however , if it is a question of travelling a whole year long or to practice some extreme sports , it is true that we take more advantages of life than anyone else whose working hard to raise a family .so i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedule you have .if you are someone who has plenty of time to do all the things you like instead of having to earn money to survive , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyone else .but it is not a matter of age .in conclusion , i would say that i do not agree with the statement above .it is not a because you are younger than someome that it is obvious you are enjoying life far more .it is a question on how you oragise your time and with who .
