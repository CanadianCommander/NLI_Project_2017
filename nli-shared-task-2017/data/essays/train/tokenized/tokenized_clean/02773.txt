successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .nowadays , people dare to change their ways of acting , their ways of thinking and just throw themselves in something new to them , because they are lucid enough to realize that nothing is free nowadays , and above all bored enough with their dull everyday lives enough to refuse to me doomed to constance and non-evolution .human beings are made to love dangerous and exciting things , to be curious about anything they never had the chance to experience before , and have hidden abilities or even talents for things they did not know .in my opinion , taking risks is inavoidable in order to succeed .risks may frighten you and make you feel weak , unconfident with yourself , with what you are doing .but still , they strengthen you , allow you to discover your limits and your gifts .i think that people can absolutely not do anything without being aware of their own limits doing that thing .for instance , last summer while i was in england for a linguistic journey with some of my friends , i saved someone who were drowning in the swimming pool .in the very second i see that little girl going down the water , i knew that was the moment of my life .i could not think or imagine what could have happened if i let her drown .my reaction was so instinctive and natural , i just threw myself in the water , embrassed her little body and lift her up so she can breathe .i would never have imagined before that i was capable of saving a life !it was a shock for me but above all a great discover , since i commited myself to join a club to learn how to save people in emergency situations .now , i created my own club , and decided to give myself to helpless persons who needs help in some difficult and brief situations .i took a huge risk in saving the little girl but i succeeded in doing it in i am very proud of myself .i have always been a shy person , not that sociable and i just discovered something that existed in me .i figured out the person i really am or can be and this pushed me to take more and more risks and chances to do as many as possible wonderful things on that world because people do not know how good persons they can be and have to prove what they are able to do for their world .
