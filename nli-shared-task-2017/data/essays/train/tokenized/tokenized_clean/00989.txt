i agree with this statement .some time companies do marketing of their products to get more profit .i think not only some but most of thems do same .there are lots of reasons and examples available to support my claim .lots of peoples are there who complains about products .they start using that product after viewing advertisements .i have a serious problem due to this .when i used to stay in india at that time , on many tv channels they saw really very popular and attractive advertisment for shampoo .it is like if you use this shampoo your hair will look like this man .you can feel change in your hair with in few weeks .so i attracted due to that and star using that product .and its true that i start feeling change in my hair .but instead of shining my hair , my hair start disapparing .yes thats true that i have hair lose problem .before i use that product i do nt have that problem .so i quit using that product any more , and start using what i used to use early .but thats not end of my problem .even today aslo i am suffering with that problem .i had spent lots of money for maditation but i did not find any improvement in my hair .but due to that madicines i have another side effect .ohh god !i am really feel so bad .not only that but now in the usa also i am affaried of trying new stuff .i think there must be some rules to make advertisements .like in advertisements companies must show what could be the side effects and how to take precations to use that product .in my case its okay , but i had seen lots of people who are suffering from serious problems just due to much more good advertisements then actually they are .according to my view point government must pass a law that companies must have to show truth in advertisements insted of imagnary things .let people live in real world and not in just imagnary world .
