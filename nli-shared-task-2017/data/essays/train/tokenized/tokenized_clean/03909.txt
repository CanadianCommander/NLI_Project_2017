i agrre it .i think successful pelple tried new things and taked risks .try is make a light of future .but some people get damage after tried , but i think all success pople got damage before success .they tried again and again and get success .first of all , if you try to something and try to accomplish , you should get a lot of problem at the middle , but do not quit when you tired .because you have a lot of chances yet .new things did not try to everybody , so if you accomplish it , you could make a big future .second , look at the around who success people .they do not say get easy about success .they got a lot of wall and became a miserable then they became a rich or famous .third , new things could makes us huppy .now , we have a lot of technology .for example , television , call phone , car , and micro chip that makes us better than long years ago .if we do not have them right now , we can not live in this world .in addition , thechnology is developing now too .im deed , i think we have to agree it , because you living and using in the new technology world , so it means that meny people tried and accomplish something .why do not dissagree it ?if you try to something , we could get a lot of new things than now .
