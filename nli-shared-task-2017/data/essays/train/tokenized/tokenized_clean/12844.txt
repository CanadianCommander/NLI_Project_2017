the history of world is very old and in this history there were made lots of innovations , researchs and etc .it is impossible for students to understand every formula in their short life period , but for making research and developments , discovering the history of the science and being innovative persons they have to learn the facts for their releated study area .first of all without understanding the main idea , students will only keep the ideas in their minds for the exams .that wo nt be true because for the research and development activities , which the students will affod in the future , they need the facts behind the formulas .secondly by understanding the concepts students will discover lots of new things .for example , when they learn how the electricty was found they will get information about the history of it and find out why it was necessary for that time .moreover , they will be informed about the hole science , too .in addition , for being a innovative person , a student have to focus on the facts and the logic behind the facts .when he or she understands a new thing , this will improve his or her vision .on the other hand , to learn how the special numbers and formulas in mathematics was found can be boring for the students .while getting the logic behind a formula students spend lots of time , which they actually can use for something better for their career .in conclusion , understanding the concepts and ideas is a must but it must have a balance , also only in the related study area of the student .otherways the education system will change to a ` keep in mind , write in the exam  system .and that will stop the developments in the future .
