i partially agree with the statement because i believe that it depends on the personal values and morals of the person in cause .this opinion not only deals with young people but also with older people .there are some young people who have a great intrest in the well being of tehir communities and therefore do ther best to improve and make it advance to a better level .these young people have certain strong principles that they strongly believe in , taught at home from their parens or at school .while there are others that can see clearly how their communities are degrading and do nothing at all about it .these people have different ideaologies than the people that do all that is in their hands to improve the communities .how do we expect these young ones to do anything for their communties if they blame them of their disgraces .violence , corruption , sexual abuse , racsim all these are factors that affect young peoples actions and opinions on their communities .if older people where to set themselves as examples the young people that are being accused of doing nothing for their communities would react , but no older people are more busy corrupting and degrading the communities .the young people that try their best to improve these communities are those that have strong faith and are very opptomistic .they have the will to undertake new projects to improve the community situations , while others have simply given up on humanity as a whole and simply try to live with their communities ; and their defects .overall it is a question of hope , principals , and faith in teh idea that things can change to better if we try to change these things .
