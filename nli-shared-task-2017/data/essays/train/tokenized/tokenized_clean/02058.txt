in a student life period and educational process students learn many ideas and facts .sometimes ideas and facts combine and can be learned together , sometimes we can learn them seperately .both of them are very important parts of education but , i disagree with the statement and in my opinion learning facts is more important than to understand ideas and concepts .first of all , facts are more memorable things than ideas and concepts .facts can contain historical victories , new improvements and also something important that worht to remember .students can easily remember the facts that they are interested in and do nt forget easily in their lifetime .for example , world war ii is an important fact in world history and it is easy to learn this fact rather than the ideologies that caused the war .secondly , facts are more realistic things rather than ideologies .you have proofs and historical documents about the connected fact , but ideas contain utopic and individual beliefs and values .it is a little bit harder to understand these utopic values if we make a comparison with the learning facts as a learning process .furthermore , learning facts is more impressive about taking interest in the issue .ideas and concepts make them curious only who are interested in the issue such as aristotle  s philosophy .but facts are more general things and can take more interest rather than ideas and concepts .to sum up , i believe learnin facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts
