cars have been playing an extremely important role in the society nowadays .while people are enjoying their obvious advantages , problems come companied with the convenience they bring .more and more people are complaining about the air pollution that cars created .however , cars , as for me , will also exert an great impaction in human society in the future .and their number will not even decrease .on the contrary , the development of cars will be surprising and momentous .twenty years can be a long time or a short time , but the development of the quality of cars , including speed , security would be tremendously huge .people will definitely enjoy these obvious advantages in the thought of travelling more places in the world that has became smaller and smaller .and there are also other aspect in their development .as you know , many institutes and countries have been doing researches to find a fuel that possess both efficiency and environmental benefits .progress have been made in these researches .and fuels can replace the role of gasoline , whose quantity has been declining because of the explosion , have two main choices .first one , for me , is hydrogen , that can be fired and used for energy and can produce few substances that pollute the environment .the next one is the usage of solar energy , a sort of energy that can be obtained from the sunlight using peculiar ways .after about twenty years , when these two kinds of energy can be used in cars , people would like to make a use of these cars under the thought to protect environment , and this thought , will be erected in ten years ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area .not only the improvement of the qualities of cars , but the usage of fuel leads me to believe that in twenty years , the number of cars will not decreased , but ascend in a large quantity due to both the improvement of the sence to protect public and natural environment and the usage of new fuel which will make cars the most effiencient and covenient means of transportation without polluting the environment .
