we should all know a little about everything , other wise we would be ignorants .it is true you ca nt learn about everything and sometimes should choose between what we want to learn , but more than anything i belive we should know many thing insted of closing our minds to what we only need .my step father , actors and every human living in this world can be used as examples for this statement .my step father profession is music he lives and breads music , but he knows about every thing !anythin you ask him he will be able to answer and this demostrates character , personality and good parenting .even though he doesent need calculus for his line of he has used his knoledge of calculus to help his daughter and i with our home works .he shaires his knowledge with everyone and even though he doese nt need it , he passes it on to someone who does .i aspire to be an actor when i go to college and being an actor is alot more than just acting and saying some lines , actors need to constantly be learning , every single piece of information they can get their hands on they learn it , they might never use it , but it is there just in case .who knows when he might land a role were he is alexander the great , good thing he read that history book when he was in college , he has to know about the character to characterize him .and of course every other human in the world .the reason i belive this world is so messed up is because we do nt take our time to learn , learn from the mistakes in the past so we do nt make them again .ignorance is the destroyer of this world we live in , not knowing , `` bah , i do nt need to know about architecture !well goverment . ..we just lost new orleans  for being ignorant to the world around us we will some day , kill the rain forest , kill the sea with all the oil diging and destroy the world with global warming .we all need to know about `` stuff  even though we ca nt know about everything , we ca nt turn the blind eyes to the things that are right there in front of you for you to learn about them .if we can make ourselfs smarter , get smarter and let knowledge in to your brain .
