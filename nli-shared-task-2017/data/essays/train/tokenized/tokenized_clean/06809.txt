king faisal once said `` working for your country is the best way to show your belonging and caring for it  when king faisal became the king of saudi arabia he s first deed was to give people the cahnace to participate and do thier best in working to devolpe the kimgdom of saudi arabia .i do nt think it will be fair if we said that young people do nt give enough time to helping thier communities , because if this was true there wo nt be amy people who will do anything to get a good aducation and defending the kingdom .getting a good education is one of the reasons that will suport my point .in order to get a high level of aducation you really must work hard which will take alot of effort and time .by mantaning a college degree the person will be able to work and make himself useful , for example my cousin is an engineer in a good company and he s making alot of money for the company , once he got a rewarde from prince nasser for an excellent project he had acomlished .also we can charity as away to spend our time helping the communtie .nowdays all muslims from oll of the world are fasting the holy month of ramadan .during this month alot of young people and children are encourged to spend their time doing somethings good for the comunity , princes joharah opened an aducational center for orphens and had invited every one .i visted this center and i have been teaching children how to read and write arabic for the past three days .it took four hours a day but it is reallu a great experincei think now it s abvoiusally clear why i think young people do spend alot of time helping their communtiy .however there will be alot of things that might keep us busy but we always should remind ourselves to our duties to the communitie .
