i basically think that it is important for the undegraduate students to have chances to get knowledge of many academic subjects .and for the garduate students , i think they should specialize in one specific subject .but i personally think , no matter the undergraduate or graduated students , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i will mention the reasons why i agree with the statement in the following paragraphs .first , i think people should keep broaden the sight for lives by studying a variety of academic subjects .i think people can not live by doing one thing , and need to learn a lot about things through lives .and if people can learn a numerous kinds of academic subjects rather than one specific subject , i think people can get more chance to do something .in my case , i learned many academic subjects when i was a college student .i especially learned about accounting , international trading , english and also chinese language class .i am now working at a japanese trading company and in charge of trading oolong tea leaves from hongkong china .and now i feel the subjects that i took at university are really useful for my business .for this exmple , taking many academic subjects to broaden knowledge is tremendously help on our way of working .second , i think that broadening knowledge by taking many academic subjects makes us greatly motivated .as i mentioned above , i took the accounting class when i was a student .actually , i was not interested in it first , but as the class went ahead , i totally addicted about the attractive characteristics of accounting .now i am working in a field of international trading but addition to this , i am now studying to get a license of japanese certified public accountant .in conclusion , i think to have boroad knowledge of many academic subjects make cahnge our sight for lives , enlarge way of working and our mind incredibly motivated .for those reasons , i myself agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
