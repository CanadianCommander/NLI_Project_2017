personally i completly agree with this statement .not only i think this statement is true , but also that this statement expresses just how successful people should think and act .i m sure that one of the most important guideline to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful , first of all you have to spent a lot of it !all the successful people such as factory owners , broadcast owners or for example fashion label owners have always clearly in their mind the sense of keeping evoluting their companies and buying or creating new ones .i also think that one of the most important thing for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money , of course , we all know that `` money makes the world go around  , but also for a feeling of desiring power !it really does nt have any sense for me to stop at what you reached . ..keep going on and further should be the right way to live our working lives .i can pick up a very well known example of a person which has been really successful : silvio berlusconi .the intention is not to discuss about he s politic ideas , but to analyse goals a person has reached .a man which has always lived following this principle .at the beginning he started creating a new broadcast and later kept creating and developping new companies .some of these always in the field of media , but some not , like the italian football team ac milan which he bought 20 years ago .another example can be seen in the american bill gates .can you imagine if he would have stopped creating and inventing computer softwares after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway .probably we would be now less evoluted .bill gates is that kind of example that makes me think that this risking , sometime innovative and brave people are , in some occasions , also very important for the evolution of mankind itself .
