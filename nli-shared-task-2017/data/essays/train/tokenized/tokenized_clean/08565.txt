in every field , school , work , social etc. there are some people more successful than other .the following statement says that these people like to take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .i agree with this statement .the successful people are always looking for improvement , they are always trying to do better because they do not always realize how good they are , they want to get challenges and to overcome difficulties .in the scientific fields there are a lot of examples of that particularity these people have .i will take the example of the radioactivity , marie curie and pierre curie were always trying to improve their discovery and they died because of searching continiously improvement .their bodies were full of radioactive elements and they died because of that .science is a great exemple of how successful people want to improve everyday their knowledge .scientifics are always looking for better inventions because they like to compete .sometimes , these people , are marginalized , and they do not have a lot of family or friends , so they focus on their work , that is why they are looking for improvement everytime .it is their way to make their life interesting .in work , successful people have to always de better because they have to prove their value in order to be promoted or not to be replaced by somebody more competent .everything is moving in life , there are always changes , the human beeing is never satisfied by himself , wether he is successful or not .we are always trying to do , to create or to give something new in order to keep us from beeing bored by life .that is just the way things are .the most dangerous thing is to get obssessed by discoveries like scientifics who died in the past to test their own inventions .
