i agree to the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them learn facts .first of all , the motivation of learning should be to know the things , to fulfill the thirst of knowledge .this ambition should be the reason , why somebody decides to study at an university .second , if somebody learns only facts , it will be even harder to keep the facts .the human memory has evolved by nature in order to better survive on this planet .at these times it was helpful to understand ideas and concepts , for example , understanding nature in favour to use it .therefore the human is not suited to learn facts , in comparison to the computer .it could be asked , why students have to learn facts at all ?the reason is simple .facts are needed to be present in the mind to construct or to follow a theory as much as bricks and stones are needed to construct an house .if students don `` t learn any facts , they can  t follow any theory , which rely on facts .therefore it is neccessary to learn facts , but the motivation for it should be to understand ideas and concepts .learning facts has to be viewed like a tool , which some people like to use and some people don `` t , but the reason to use the tool doesn  t lie in the tool itself .as i described above , the human mind is not intended to learn facts .but to develop a complicated theory , it is neccessary to know facts .therefore the society created rewards for using learning facts .a teacher rewards a student , if he learns well and if he learns facts accurately .some students are attracted so much by these rewards , that they only learn facts to achieve the reward .everybody of us experienced them in the school class , where some pupils learned very ambitiously and accurately , but it was easy to see , that they prefered receiving the reward instead of satisfying their thirst of knowledge .as a solution to this phenomena at school , i propose to reward the understanding of ideas and concepts much more then just learning the facts .the pupils need the discipline to the learn facts , but they also need to see , why the are learning them .
