progress and development in a general way was made by hardworking people who specialize themselves in a specific subject .one question could be ask weither it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in my opinion every one should have a minimum of knowledge in many academic subjects but sooner or later we have to choose a specific subject otherwise progress will stop or grow very slowly .for example what would had happened if no one had studied biology specifically ?medecin would nt have evolved and diseases and viruses would have spread without vacccins or medecins to stop them .we could give similar examples for transports that are progressing rapidly since the invention of the wheel people worked very hard to invent new ways of transportation ( the bycicle then the car then the plane . .. )if every one had a broad knowloedge of many academic subjects mankind would have very slightly evolved from the stoneage .all the study s , the researches helped the world not only in a scientifical way but even in a economical way , study s of businesses have helped the businesses owners to know how to manage effectively their company s on a large scale this would help a whole country s economy and will then help the fight against poverty .it is essential for a healthy world to understand and study specific subjects that could help us in oure lives but this does nt mean that the person that is specialised in a subject should be completely ignorant of all exept this specific subject ; like i said before we should all have a minimum of general knowledge of many academic subjects but for the sake of progress we should specialize ourselves in a specific subject .
