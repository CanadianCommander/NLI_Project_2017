when we are students , most teachers teach us idea , concepts , and facts .i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn fact .this is because there are several benefits .one is that we can use the idea and concepts not only one case .it means that learning the idea and concepts make us intelligent .for example , my teacher who teaches middle school always says that it is meaningless to remember the answers .it is more important to think that why it is happen or occure .to understand the idea and concepts is going to be not only the memories but also the power of thinking .the other is that the facts is not always true .for example , famous tv show was stopped in japan last week .this is because the tv show said completely faked things .if people do nt know the idea and concepts , they only beleive the facts even if that is incorrect .we get the knowledge from researching .when we doubt something , we have to check and find the true fact .in order to get the true fact , we should understand the idea and concepts .so , teacher want us the flow to lead the answers during the test .concequently , i agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more efficient for students than learing facts .above those , one is that idea and concepts proveide us the power of thinking .the other is that fact is not always true .we need to research something in themselves .
