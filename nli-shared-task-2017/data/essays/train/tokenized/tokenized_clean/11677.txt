i completly agree with this statement because in all advertisement the product they show is the best of all , they show the product as if it is the 8 wonder of the world , but when you go to buy the product because you are completly facinated about it you notice that is nt even the half of what they said .this happens to all people in the world eventhouh all people know that what advertisements said are never correct they always want to go and buy the product and keep falling on buying the product they wanted .this statement should be place on every advertisement because sometimes that are really rare times the advertisement is correct and people think if they should buy it or just let it go because it may not be what they saw .this creat loses in some companies because they now need to show the people that what they are selling its the real stuff .in some way what they are doing is cheating the costumers in every way because costumers go buy things , things that they think are correct but at the end they lose their money , the product and they ca nt do anything about it because they have already pay for it .the advertisements that really cheat costumers are the ones given on the web , things that you can buy on the web are most of the time not what the costumer wanted .but they are also things that you can buy on the web like programs because they will always be what they said the program has .in conclusion i think that companies that make this kind of advertisment are doin it just to get a profit of it but what they are really doing is makig their company fall because if they at the beginning starte to show advertisements that are nt real costumers wont buy any thing else from thta company even if after the company startes to amke good stuff .as my advice i think that companies should show the product as it is or make the product look exactly as they show in the advertisement
