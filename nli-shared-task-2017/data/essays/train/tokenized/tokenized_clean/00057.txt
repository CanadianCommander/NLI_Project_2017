advertisemnts have been known as the sole source for people to know about products ; therefore , many people tend to believe all what they hear in media means .many advertisment companies promote thier products perfectly and fictionally than they really are ; therefore , i agree with this statement .my points of veiw is that those companies wants to increase thier profits and to compete othe competetors .first , many advertisment companies make products much better than they really are in order to increase their profits .greediness plays a part in this problem .as the people get monery this guality terrifingly increase along with it .they try to use every means to increase thier profits at the end of the years .what those people do is exploiting people needs of a cheap products by decresing the quality and the costs of thier products , and to crow all this , they promote their products in media .as a resulte , people rush to the supermarkets after hearing the ad without thinking .last years , for example , i saw an ad about shampoo that make the hair nicer .i was so surprised with its price and did not noticed that it was bad for the hair .as i used that shapoo , my hair started to fall down and had to rush to my doctor to help me in this .in addtion to the increase of thier profits , some advertisment companies make products much better than they really are in order to compete other companies .in this vicious world of business , any means whether it is legil or not is valid .those companies  aim is competeing others even if that means exploiting people needs .what they want is be the pioneer and first in everythings .as a resultes , they add many untrue information about thier products in order to convince the buyer to purchase from them and not from other companies .when you open a t.v. you will see what i mean .ads are all over the channels .thouthands od them about a particluar products that it is hard to choose from .those ads provide information that do not make any sense or are not persuasive .i saw a an ad about a car , saying that when you ride in it you will feel that you are flying .so i went to thatcar shop and tried it , thier seats were like a stone .then i knew that thier advertisemnet was fake and untrue .gaining more profits and competing other companies are reasons which allowed many companies to exploit people need for better and cheaper products .govermants should enforece or emphizis their roles in this byy stricts those advertisments and pass an regulation that punish any company which try to mislead people .for the above reasons , i agree that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
