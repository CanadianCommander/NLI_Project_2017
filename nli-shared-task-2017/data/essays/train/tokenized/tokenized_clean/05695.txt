i strongly agree with the given statement .from my point of view understanding ideas and concepts should be the top priority for students than learning facts .there are many strong reasons that have influenced me in accepting this statement .these reasons are presented in the subsequent paragraphs .firstly , its my firm belief that students should have a solid understanding of concepts and ideas .this would build them up in such a way that they would be in a position to further research these ideas and present their points of view .research has also shown that students understand better when they have a firm grip over the fundamentals .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts would develop and hone their analytical ability .the analytical ability is now a crucial factor in judging the intellect of an individual .thirdly , mere learning of facts with out understanding the concepts would encourage rote memorization .this would hinder the development process of a child .this would make him a mere data storage device .fourthly , when we learn from facts especially historical facts much depends on the authenticity of the information that has been provided .it is quite possible that the information provided by archaelogists or historians might have been altered by the then existed governments .governments might alter the information provided by them , when they think that it would hurt the sentiments of people or cause a conflict among different socio-cultural groups .fifthly , i feel that in this age of technology mere learing of facts would not suffice .the technological innovations demand an individual to have critical thinking ability , strong analytical skills and a firm grip over the basics of the subject .only when the basics are strong can a student understand the innovation and further research the idea .i strongly feel that `` only when the roots are strong can a tree stand tall and firm .these are the compelling reasons that have influenced me in stating that understanding ideas and concepts is far better than learning facts .
