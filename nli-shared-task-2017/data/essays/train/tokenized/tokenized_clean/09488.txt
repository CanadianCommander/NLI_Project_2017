i clearly disagree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .the only constant thing in this world is `` change  .things are changing from the way they used to be before .man is also changing .the phase of his life , when he used to find it difficult to earn his daily bread has almost come to an end .the living conditions have been improving .man is able to earn enough to support his , as well as , his families needs .man has become a very busy animal with his appointments , meetings , business and many more issues which demand most of his time , caliber , intellengence and effeciency .he also has his daily chores which he has to finish before calling it a day .to keep up with all this he needs fast and convinent transport to help him reach his destination on time .car is a convinent mode of transport for him .it is no more a status symbol .it has become a necessity .it a very common thing , nowadays , to own a car .the advancing technology and the need for fast transportation result in more people owing cars .apart from fossils being the primary source of fuels to ignite the engins , new forms of energy are also being developed .one among them is , trapping of the solar energy .cars can now be run on solar energy .this eco friendly development is a boon to man .he need not spent mpre money to just fill his cars tank with gas .hence , i opine that there will be an increase in the number of cars rather than a decrease .
