whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities or not is controversial .some point out that they are quite busy to give helpness to their society while others insist that they would be great hands to help the communities .i strongy disagree with the opinion that youth does not give enough time to helping their communities .first , they would pay close attention to society where they belong to , even though there are a lot of burdens they have to deal with by themselves .here is an example .in my case , as a university student , i have worked for youth organization which is for helping young generation .one of what i have done was to participate in the summer camp for people who do not have parents or any relatives .the action i have achieved was to be a sister for them and take care of them .i insist that there might be plenty of volunteers who join the youth group as a one of the young people .second , young people are willing to get involved in their juniors to give advices in school .i have been helped by my predecessors in regard to the homework which i could not solve by alone and the way to reach the dream i have held .they gave me various information making me intelligent and stimulated me to fulfill my goal .in addition , now i am giving helpness and many kinds of advices to my juniors as my predecessors did .it means that young people are delighted to helping their school .to sum up , young people , especially getting involved in the school , organization in the current society give sufficient time to help their communities .there is no doubt in my mind that young people play important roles in their group .
