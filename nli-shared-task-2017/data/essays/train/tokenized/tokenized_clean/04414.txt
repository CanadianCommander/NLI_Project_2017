it is of my opinion that helping communities is quite important for me .with the concerning of the young people may not have enough time to devote themselves to helping their communites , i have several reasons and solutions as the followingsfirst , young people are energetic than the elders , they spend a lot of time in studying as well as playing .they learn all the time and have the will to learn .if they are asked to manage things with their neighbors , they will not refuse and hesitate to do .in this prime time , young people like to help with each other to solve the problem .next to go would be , the definition of the communities may not simply mean the surroundings they live .it can also be inferred the place they study and work .young people like to join clubs and learn something new in order to satisfy the thirst toward knowledge .they concentrate with a specific field and lauch their efforts to achieve their ideal goal .all these accomplishments need time and thier endeavor .moreover , they learn in helping .such as decorating a club center , recruiting new blood to the club , and even taking care of the sick classmate or neighbor preoccupied with business .however , though they are so active in their community affair , there definitely are blind spots that they probably fail to focus on .for example , young people who live outside may encounter the gap between them and their family .for example , when i was an undergraduate who live far away from family , being not able to go home per week makes some communicational problems with my family members .as a whole , young people do have enough time to helping thier communities .t
