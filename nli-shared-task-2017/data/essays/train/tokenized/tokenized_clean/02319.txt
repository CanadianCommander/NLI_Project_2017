in my country , the educational system both teaches you to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts .these two concepts have their own advantages .however , i believe it is more important to understand ideas and concepts .that is why i agree with the statement .first , l think that learning facts is not a clever method to follow because it does not lead to create intelectual stimulation .indeed , even if i agree to say that it could be a nice way to strike students by giving funny or odd examples , the thing is that you can not simply remember all the facts you are supposed to learn .for example , during my history classes in college , i had to remember long lists of events and facts without connections between them .this was so dense and unclever that i did not remember half of them !on the contrary , understanding ideas and concepts is more useful .first , by understanding them you will be able to implement them in the future , contrary to the facts or events which you can not obviously re create .second , school is supposed to prepare you for your professional life .so if you understand the ideas and concepts , you will understand how does it works and will be able to deal efficiently with challenges .for instance , i attended some economics courses .thanks to my understnading of some key concepts , i now better understand how does the world works , and especially the political system .thus , because students are supposed to face the professional life with the most numerous keys possible in order to deal with it successfully , i strongly think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than simply learn by heart facts and events .
