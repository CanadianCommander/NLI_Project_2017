i agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .first , when people do not often use cars , the air of the city will become clearer than now .when i was keio junior high school student , a private school in tokyo , the capital city of japan , i lived near the supermarket which had a lot of parkings for the cars of the customers .the air near my house was very dark , i was always sick inmy throat .but when i was tokyo university student , i moved to the small town where people did not use cars at all .so i became nice of my conditions of throat because of the cleanness of air .second , in twenty years more and more transportational sytem will become expanded all over the world .when i began to work in osaka , the second big city of japan , i went to the office by car , because there was no transportational system , for example , subway , bus , train .but i was worried about a heavy traffic jam every day , besides i was often late for the starting time of the office .after two years , now , i can go to the office by subway happily because the transportational system became expanded to the station near my office .now unlike me what two years ago , i am never late for the starting time of the office .so , in twenty years , people will use more transportational systems which have not any traffic jam .therefore i strongly agree the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
