the question askes to discuss the usage and the effect of advertisements on products .first of all , my opinon about this question is that advertisements do change the point of view in terms of its quality or usage .many customers become manipulated in the way how a product is presented .for example the store aldi in germany sells many different food products .these products are not advertised at all and have no nice brandings and designs .that makes them cheaper and many people buy these to save money and still get very good products .these people are the minority of all customers in germany .most of the people buy their food in great warehouses .these markets use a lot of advertisements to offer their goods .even these goods come from the same production or have the same quality as goods from aldi .the people buy them because of the better style or the higher price .quality has it s price they think .in fact this shows that people trust more in the quality and taste of products if the advertisement tells that .another example are televison advertisements .usually there are nice-looking people acting to manipulate the spectator .the spectator thinks he or she could be this human and gets more atractive if he or she buys the product .the importance of the product is not important anymore .to manipulate the customer and giving him the illusion life can not continue without buying this product is a very common procedure nowadays .therefore many magazines offer testing reports on products of main interest .they test each item and rank all of them afterwards in terms of quality or price .many people today do not buy electronic items before they have researched testing reports and comments from other people .it is too unsafe for them to buy in an affect of a nice advertisement .it is more important to get what is needed .
