in my opinion ideas and facts are both importants and linked by a relationship of cause - effect .the fact is a description of what some people thought and they have had the power to traslate an idea in an action .when i was attending the high school , i remember i told my mother that the school gave us just some information about the facts that has happened and not the possibility to understand new ideas .for example , in my opinion , the history has two interpretations : some people think that it is useful to learn facts , while other think that beginning from the past facts , you can understand the present history .the history is like a circle , sometimes it repeats the same situations , the same mistakes , the same facts .to learn facts is the better way to understand the ideas , and honestly i scared about the people who has got the ideas without knowing the facts or without giving to them the right relevance .so the fact is important to understand the situation and to analyse which is the best idea to use in that moment .it s true that the analyse of facts is useful to start thinking and it permits to stimulate more the brain of the students , with discussion with the teacher .i hope that in the school there will be during the history class ( or other subject ) , the time to discuss why some facts happened .
