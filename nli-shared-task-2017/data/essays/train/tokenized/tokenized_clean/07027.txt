i disagree the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in japan , there are following reasons .first , the way of thinking is verifing now , so car makers should produce many kinds of cars to match the pople s needs .some pople use theircars only when go shopping , others use their cars as a kind of hobby .they like suport cars , racing cars or off road cars , etc .today , a tipical family living in japan has one car .but it is said that a tipical family living in jpan will have two cars in a few years .one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother .the price of cars has bacome very cheap because of technology development , a tipical family will be able to buy two cars in a few years .in addion , in japan , we can not have second car now because we do nt have enough parking space in our home or we can not pay the expensive parking fee .but there days , the japanese real estates have become cheaper than before .if this situcation continues , we will be able to have enough parking space in our home or pay enough parking fee in a few years .at last , in japan , the goverment improves the railroads and highways by investing a lot of money these days .because the public transportation system in japan has been imploved these thirty years , and then the govermaent now thinks to improve the railroads and highways mainly .as a resault , the terrible trafic jams in japan will be resolved in a few years , so the number of japanese who want to buy and use their car will increase .so , i totally disagree the ideat that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in japan .
