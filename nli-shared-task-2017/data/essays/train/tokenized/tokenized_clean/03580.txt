although students are very different from each other - so what is true and valid for one may not be true and valid for an another - i generally agree with the statement , but i think one element can not be separated from the other : this means that there are no ideas and concepts without facts , and there are no facts without ideas and concepts .from my point of view facts are not so important if you don  t have the instruments for analysing them , and the instruments are given by ideas and concepts : understanding the `` abstract  ideas gives students the tools for facing reality and learning facts , otherwise they would not get anything of what they are reading , for examples on history books , which are the places where you can mostly find `` facts  .history is to me the best example of this mutual relationship between concepts and facts because it is made of facts , but the study of history can not exist without ideas and concepts .i can mention my personal case : when i was a student i really enjoyed studying history , but when i grew up i realized this was because i consider history more as a collection of interesting and pictoresque events than as real actions done by people who have lived before me , and whose actions has had an effect on our present ( latins used to say `` historia magistra vitae  ) ; this means at the time i missed the connections , i did nt apply those marvellous stories to the present , in other words i did not understand ideas and concepts .now that i am more mature i see things from a different perspective , and i try to approach facts always keeping in my mind some general principles .thisis why i think students in schools , even if very young , should try to do the same , of course with the help and assistance of their teachers .
