in ancient greece , a philosopher who founded his own school expected applicants to know geometrics as well .is that still the case today ?we shall hereby prove that due to the advance of sciences , this has become almost impossible , though a broad culture is a paramount asset to modern life .many philosophers and geniuses throughout history showed that having an extremely broad knowledge was possible : voltaire french philosopher of the end of the seventeenth century , was an famous writer as well as a good ingeneer in agriculture .at these times , there had been a major intellectual movement whose goal was to gather every scientifical and technical knowledge in encyclopedias .since there was not many of them , contributors to those books had to acquire this knowledge themselves !moreover , it was seen as a way to set oneself appart from old religious schemes which were seen as a tool of obscurantism .yet , now that science triumphed from religious doctrines which were judged somehow simplistic as explanations of natural processes , the scientifical methodology itself has made universal knowledge virtually impossible to gather for one individual alone .being the key to the improvement of production and the welfare of human beings , science was rationalized to such an extent that no one can publish any decent academic article or research works without having been granted the diplomas to do so , which implies studying the subject for durations that can reach decades .one usually has to attend classes for more than ten years to become a doctor !nevertheless , one must not forget that science binded with elitistic norms of education can become a threat to democracy , as soon as knowledge becomes the private property of a small group of overspecialized office holders .ignorance as a way to keep people under control was most commonly used in authoritarian regimes such as south africa , in which the coulour-skinned could not be taught in english , which was the language of the administration .this aims to prove that though specialization is required nowadays , a broad culture is vital to everyone in order to prevent any abuse .
