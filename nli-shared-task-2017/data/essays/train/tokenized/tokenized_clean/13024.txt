ideas , concepts , facts are three important methods to know the topic , this will be there for every aspect .in somecases all three are important to know the topic in detail .my opinion about this statement - i am disagreeing with following statement .each and every method is essential for better knowing of the topic .some aspects will require any of the method for understanding .while all some require all the three for better understanding of the topic .for example if a boy was thaught about a topic , and he is thaught all the theories related to the topic and some reasons lying under the subject , the boy will understand partially about the topic .if he is given some in examples where and when the topic is used and shows how it works , then the boy understand the the topic clearly .however the methods depend on the age and in which grade is he studing .if the student is in primary grade all methods are not necessary for him , moreover he rather gets confused if he is thaught .and the student who is doing graduation or undergraduation , he requires all the three methods as he has to submit research papers on every subject .in conclusion , i rather believe that all the three methods are important to understand , moreover the main reason for this is the student will be having no doubts on the subject and he will be familiar and perfect with the subject .i think it is better to know all about the topic , so that will be like `` digging a mine of wisdom  .
