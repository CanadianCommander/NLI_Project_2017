i think both are important .to learn ideas an concepts help to us to ubicate in a context and time .normally , they are very useful when there are not experience in one subject .concepts help to start to know about any issue and then , normally people start to develop your own judge about things and understand the different alternatives that exist for a problem .in the other hand , facts are also imporatant because bring to us part of the knowledge and helps to bring more information .i think every fact must to be acompanied by concepts and ideas clearly understood .facts help to us to have a general idea about some special issue and help us to ubicate in the context we want to develop .also facts helps to understand about anything in a very brief manner , they are very useful when there is a short period of time for analyze information or know about something .i.e. if you are a customer and need to know about some company , it will be very helpful to have a spreadsheet of the company with the main facts .after that you will have to investigate more about that fact but it is very helpful for initiate that investigation .concepts helps to support any idea that each person want to develop , also help to understand how the things works and evaluate diferent options .concepts are essential part of our life .if we dont have concepts , we dont have knowledge , so we need to be guessing all the time .it is important to mention that to know a concept is not enough , the most important issue is understand it , because once we know the concept and understand it we can apply our own ideas , other concepts , solutions , etc. and find a logical solution to almost all the things .
