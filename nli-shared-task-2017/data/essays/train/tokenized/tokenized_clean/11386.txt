this statement brings up a very important concept that i have had several occasions to reflect on during and after my student s life .as my own experience proved me many times , it was more important to have the tools and concepts to understand the facts around me than to learn the facts without understanding the whys and hows of them .i have followed a scientific education and been very sensitive to all scientific topics since my youngest age .what always appealed to me in science was the fact that events could all find a logical explanation and that the world , after all , could be directed by understandable laws .as an example , knowing that the water , when boiling , becomes vaporized , and therefore a gas , only gives the student a fact that he can observe , but from which he can not draw any conclusion in the future .on the other hand , knowing that all elements on earth can have three different phases , solid , liquid and gaz , give the students a concept .this concept , in turn , can be apply to any material on earth .it then explains why water boils , but it will also explain why iron melts or why azote can be found in a liquid form at lower temperature .another example could be found in history , where knowing the facts is , at first , the primary work of the students when they are teenagers .the teacher would spend hours telling them about the history of their country and what happened when .but , i know for myself , that the most interesting part of history teaching is not the facts , but why such events happened .and how these events helped formed a nation s history , which in its turn created new facts .knowing a date in itself does not really help to understand why a country decided to invade another one .as a conclusion , training the students , to derive conclusions from observations and concepts they have learned , is a very important skill that would help anybody when faced later on in his life with new events .personnaly , this is how i have always viewed my education , as a provider of a great toolbox , that i could use anytime .so far it helped me a lot .
