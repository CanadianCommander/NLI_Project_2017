understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than just learning facts .the ideasare the things that should come first when they learn something , and it will let them to take steps forward .to make them more interested and be able to solve advanced problems , they can not avoid to learn the ideas and the concepts .first , the ideas and concepts help them understand the facts , and it may make students interested in the topic .knowing the background or the reasons why the facts occur or occured is very important before they learn the facts .for example , to learn about the world war two , they should learn not only the year it started , the year it ended , the number of people died , but they should know learn more about the background of the war .knowing why it happened , why it was ended like that , etc. may encourage the students more intrested about the war and might think more .next , they can advance their knowledges and skills from learning the ideas and concepts .those who know the ideas and concepts would be able to answer the problems in many kinds of situations , whereas those who learned only the facts can only answer the problem in the way they learned .we can see it especially in math exams .the ideas and concepts would help them to answer advanced problems that they had not solved before but it is possible to answer by using skills they had learned .to develop the students  knowledge and skills , the ideas and the concepts have big role .in the class room , the teacher should take much time to teach them the ideas and the concepts .then the students would be more interedted in the topic and , it would be easier for them to understand the facts .
