i disagree with the following statement .there are several reasons why i disagree with it .first of all , since the population in the world is rapidly growing especially in the developing countries , they need cars to live as well as those developed countries .the more the world population is getting increase , the more cars are needed .i think it s important for those people to have a car in developing countries because they can use it in many ways to live better .second , the innovation of the technology allows us to have the kind of cars that are not harmful for the environment and nature .for instance , some people started having solar-cars , which do nt produce the harmful gas in the air .human have been inventing a lot of new things and nowadays , people have started making new things that are good for nature .solar-car is a not only an example , but also produce enegy using wind , earth s heat , water , and new clear power .surly our lives have been getting better .i think it is possible to make even better things than we have now .but we always have to remember , this world is not only ours .we must not destroy the ecosytem in nature , the living style they have been kept and and the way they are .considering those things and make new better things is the best way for both of them .third , a lot of people love cars .some people just like having a car , others like driving a car , and the others like riding a car .the level of the japanese car companies is very high in worldwide , and one thing that we should proud .it s a big hobby in the world .for those reasons , i do not agree with the following statement .
