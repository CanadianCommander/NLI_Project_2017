i believe that we should attempt new trials and take some risks for more successful life .because trials and errors let us realize our limitaions , and so , we can correct our errors and try to overcome our defects .in addition , though there are some dangers in attempting new works , it creats unexpected results , gives great inspirations and makes us stronger and better .i think that most people have limitations physically or mentally or financially .if we just satisfy with our current situations , we never improve our life and never experience better and hidden happiness .for example , beethoven , a renowned musican and a great human , had an ear disease .he did nt even hear audience s loud applause after the premieur of his last symphony .however , despite his severe sickness , beethoven tried to overcome his defect and created many new and innovative classical music .due to his efforts , today many people hear many exceptional touching sounds .if he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself , not only he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet many great music .moreover , i think that crisis and danger sometimes produce unexpected results and make us stronger and competent person .for instance , many scientists have researched some risky and doubtful facts and they have found many wonderful solutions .thses discoveries have developed science and our life .in addition , in my experience , when i faced difficulties in my job , i did not avoid them and tried to resolve those problems .as a result , i could find various solutions and develop myself into a competent staff .in conclusion , i do believe that trials and risks make people stronger and better .we all have a brain and a heart .i think that we need to use and devleope them through efforts to overcome our current obstacles .
