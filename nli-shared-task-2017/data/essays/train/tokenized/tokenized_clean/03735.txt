trowgh the history of knowledge , there have been many ideas and trends about the best way to get and approach it .may be the most common ones that are still present in our academic lives , and command most of the present teaching models we can find at schools and university .the firs of them and may be the older one , inducts the knowledge , that mens some one have that knowledge and give it to others , that person is the master , the autority and almost superior , and their alumns follow him .in to the other hand , we can find a more modern concept that promote the constructions of knowledge , that means each person can approach the knowledge in their own way , can get the ideas and concepts and constructs whith them .in that case there are facilitators who gives that concept and the tools that students need .that we can usually find this days in schools and even at university is a combination of both so depending on what is strongly enphasised we will get different result .personally , i studied in a waldorf school that emphasis the construction approach to knowledge and later i had to go into a traditional school , that emphasis in induction of knowledge .now i am sure i had an advantage over the other students in the traditional school because i primarly lern how to get and understand ideas and concepts and construct knowledge .if you just learn fact , with time you shurely forget them .if you clearly understand concepst you will be able to construct again knowledge .
