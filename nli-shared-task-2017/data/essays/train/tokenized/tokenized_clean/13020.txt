according to me having a broad knowledge is important at the biginning stages of your knowledge building .it serves as the base or foundation for your knowledge .for me having the ability to contribute in every possible field in acadamic subjects is the great thing .the main reason for this is my excitement and quick grasping power which attracts me to the every new and different thing around me .i prefer to have every possible knowledge of all the subjects .this developes interest and also helps to experience more number of fields rather than many things in same field .by having broad knowledge of many subjects makes average level of knowledge very high .but by speciallising in one subjects restricts the growth of knowledge in other subjects and also it has a specific limit .what after that limit ? , when you know everything in the same subject .for me its important to know more about many things than knowing everything about one thing .for example in any industry , the main work consists of many small works such as machine handling , actually working on that machine , its maimtainance , repairing ant many things like this in many regions .here its not possible to solve every problem by only one specialist .because he has the knowledge about one thing only .so he cant help for the other problems .here the role of generlist is important .he has answers for many things and in many fields .we can say manager .manager is called so because he can manage all things .so i prefer to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects and thats why the are being introduced , thats why they are being teached .otherwise people will have one subject only .which can not work .in todays world you cant live with knowledge of only one field .more the knowledge more you can grow .for me being a jack of everything is the best way to grow in knowledge .
