in my opinion , the statement given is partly true and partly false .although the sense of community service has decresed to some extent among the young people , the number of people who conciously take up community service has not decreased .i would like to support my view with the following reasoning .firstly , i think that this statement is not completely true because , in the past , community service was mandatory in many countries .for example , in germany , every individual had to serve in the army for a minimum of two years .this was not a concious decision taken by the individual but by the government .presently , there is no such rule .so , when it comes to statistically comparing the number of individuals who on their own , take up community service of some kind or the other , there is no big change in the numbers .also , in the past , the number of people who remained dedicated to community service is very small compared to the number of young people who were exposed to it .secondly , the reason why i think the statement is valid to certain extent is : due to a drastic change in the pace of life in the present era of globalization , young people spend most of their time building up their careers and catching up with the rapidly changing world .in this process , they find very less time to devote to community service .and even if they do devote some time , it is not a concious effort .that is , because of the less time they get to devote to community service , young people do not understand the joy , purpose and responsiblity involved in the process of community service .so , to certain extent the stament is infact true .to sum up , i would like to state that statement is partly false because the percentage of people commiting to community service these days is more or less the same as the percentage of people who conciously commited to community service in the past .also , the statement is partly true to a certain extent in putting forward that young people these days do not involve in service because of the reasons put forward above .
