help others to help your nationin the present day world where technology is advancing at such a high rate and where the economy is booming , it seems that the world has somewhere lost the meaning of helping others .the present youth is more actively involved in making fast money in order to enjoy a life filled with luxuries .people have indeed become more selfish and self-centered and do not think twice abt taking out some time from their lives to help their communities or the underpriviliged .i am indeed very ashamed to admit that the youth of the present generation does not involve itself in any social or charitable work .the youth needs to tighten their buckle and needs to start acting upon this grave matter .it is often seen that the youth filled with its raw and uninhibited passion and spirit is able to change the world and make a noticeable difference .the youth has indeed forgotten its responsibilities and duties .i would like to expalin the above by illustrating the fact that many youngsters spend whopping amounts of money on celebrating their birthdays and other occasions .what i would like the youth is to spend some time with their grandparents and elderly relatives or do some type of charitable work on their date of birth if they find it too taxing to do it on a regular basis .in doing so , they indirectly play a very imprtantrole in shaping a healthy and ultimately a prosperous nation .setting up awareness camps in rural or underdeveloped areas canhelpspread awareness about various diseases and the like .such efforts can induce people to be more cautious about their health-and being healthy can ensure a better chance of survival .the youth can help its communities in every effort they put in .for example , recently my elder sister organised a blood donation camp and a rally to spread awareness about female foetacide on the eve of gandhi jayanti .her heartfelt efforts attracted many students and even faculty memebers of her college .all of them took part very passionately and indeed helped spread awareness in our small town .similarly .i feel very strongly that the youth needs to take varoius steps in this particular direction so that it can improve the standard of living of their communities and help work towards a more prosperous and developed nation
