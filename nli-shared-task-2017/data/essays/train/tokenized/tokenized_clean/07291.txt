in my opinion it may be better to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects rather than having knowledge on a single subject and it may not be true always . .first , i believe this because now a days the competition is more .it may be touf to compact with this competition we must have our leg on different areas .for example take a company it wll prefer the employee who done a business course and degree course rather than the person with only degree course .this is because they think that he wll be usefull to the organisation more than the later .second , every subject we learn wll be usefull to us in our life at a point .for an instance take mathematics it wll be usefull for us to calculate the sum , measure measurments etc .so if a man have knowledge on only one subject it wll be hard to survive the life .and he shold depend on others for simple reasons .third , some subjects may be disappear .this is because lak of intreset in that particular subject .take a subject that is not intrested by many of the students for example history .many people donot like the history subject because they feel it bit boring .if they donot have a knowledge on history then there may be the consequences like forgetting our old traditions , cultures completely .which may not be good .although we must have a broad knowledge on many subjects we should be perfect in a specific subject that is our intreset of study .by getting a minimal knowledge of the all subjects may answer all the question posed above .but itself wll not be sufficent .the advantages of having a knowledge on a specified subject are as follows .by getting more information on the particular subject may help us to built our carrier more systamatically .not only that by having a more knowledge on one subject helps us to motivate developing new ideas .we may know the erros generally done by the people and we may solve them easily effectively and more efficiently .so we have advantages in both of the statements ! .so i like to solve the problem by saying that `` it would be good to have a knowledge on subjects to all subjects in young age say before graduation and have a knowledge on specific subject from the graduation which will sounds good for all the answers  .
