most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i do not completely agree with the above statement because advertisements have both advantages and disadvantages .firstly , i will discuss about the advantages with quite a few examples .what exactly a person looks for while buying a product ?may be the price , quality or some other factor .more clearly , we can say that he or she is not sure in certain situations .finally , they make a decision to buy something new which they have seen last night in the commercial ad .simlarly , when people does not know anything about a particular product , in most cases , they rely on advertisements .thats an other plus point of advertising .apart from this , most of the time people spend their leisure time by watching television and reading books , which are the excellent sources for advertising .as a result , public come to know about the new products through the ads .coming to the disadvantages , the first and foremost is with the children .whenever they found the ad to be attractive , they want u to buy the product for them , regardless they use it or not .when comes to the food stuff , they always try to go for the junk food , where the ads cash in by showing them attractive .sometimes , we see some of the products to be less expensive .we usually gets attracted to and purchase them .but the final result is that it gets damaged after a short period .we have to compromise for the quality .in the conclusion , i would like to say that advertisements does not make us buy less quality products all the time but they do sometimes .it is our mental ability to think what to purchase and what not ?in most cases , the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are
