the statement if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , is very difficult to evaluate , because it depends on how well someone does on a special topic .thus , it is very difficult for me to agree or disagree with the above mentioned statement .in my opinion a person can also be successful in doing things which he or her knows in detail .when i think of a professor of mathematics for instance who is teaching at a university , it is even necessary for him to know his subject very well .he is also successful , although he does not try new things , because there are no real discoveries in math which can be made .everything is already fully discovered .nevertheless , there are people who need to try new things in order to be successful , scientists for example .if you do not take risks , you will not have any success in your field of study .a very controversial topic at the moment is cloning .everyday , genes are getting reproduced by several scientists .all this started some time ago when `` dolly  the first sheep was cloned .the world at that time was shocked .these scientists who were responsible for dolly s existence took the risk of maybe creating a monster , because no one has ever had any experience with this technology .many people , especially those with religious backgrounds , raised many concerns .but despite these critics , the scientists moved on dealing with human embryos .in the usa , voices have already announced that a human has been cloned .to my mind , this is defintely a success , whether or not you agree with the ethical background .scientists have taken the risk and they have tried new things .consequently , they have been successful .the point i am trying to make is that the statement i had to discuss is bias .on the one hand , it is necessary for being successful to discover new areas , but on the other hand people can also be good in only one thing .it just depends on the kind of person you are .all in all , i can not disagree or agree with this statement , because for me both are very important facts for being successful !
