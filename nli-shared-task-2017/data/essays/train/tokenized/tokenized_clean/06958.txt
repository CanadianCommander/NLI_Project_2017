i think the best way to travel is traveing alone .however , if i do nt used to traveling places like language and culture , i need to go there with tour guide .consequently , if i trip to somewhere at first , it is the best way to take tour guide s help .when i was 6 years old , i travelde in japan with my family .at that time , i was so young trip to japan alone and i couldt speak japan at all .abobe all , i could nt be knowing japanese culture .after all , i need my parent as a tour guide .they live in japan for 7 years and speak japanese very well like japanese .at that time , if i know japanese a little and their culture , i can enough travel in japan alone .if someone do nt know traveing palce s culture and their languages , they will lose their way and sometimes they make mistakes like food habit .in india , they ca nt eat cow s meat for realigious belief and they do nt use sticks when they eat food , they use only their hand .of course , if we know traveling palces s culture and language , we can travel alone .there are some reasons to travel alone except tour guide .at first , we can travel freeway .if we travel some places with tour guide , they will always interuppt us until we traveld to finish .second , we can learn their culture and their language for myself .if we have a few knowledges about thier culture and speak their language a little , we can grow up language skills and our knowledges about othter culture .and then , we can explain our thinking to friends , family and relatives , so we will feel achivements .i think it is the best way to trip traveling palces alone if we have enough knowledge about their culture and speak their language .we can get many things form traveling in strange palces .
