i do agree with the previous statement , for i am convinced that people who try new things are able to innovate and discover new trains of thought that would otherwise not be discovered .if these people only did what they already already know how to do well , they would always experience the same results , feeling that they do not bring much added value to the society they live in .moreover , by taking risks and daring to go where no other individuals have gone , successful people are not only driving forces of their communities , but also leaders that motivate other people to achieve their own goals .i will further support my view with the following approaches :- psychological considerations .- my own experience .as an industrial engineer from the mexican institute of technology , i acquired a thorough quantitative and analytical grounding .fortunately , my coursework also included studying behavioural finance , subject that enabled me to find an interest in psychology , social science i found complemented my understanding of efficiency and the human factor particularly well .through reading extensively on the subject , i began feeling a particular appeal for the works of t.j. walker , an outstanding social researcher who has focused on the practical aspects of psycho-sociology particularly well .in one of his books , `` riddles of the human mind  , he explicitly entails the topic of innovation and risk taking .he mentions that people who are able to innovate and take risks in order to achive their goals are usually much more self-fulfilled individuals .they are also much more goal oriented and able to motivate people more effectively .in my country there is an old saying that says that `` what one has eaten , travelled and danced is one s to keep and can never be taken away .this is indeed a wise saying that i myself have witnessed with my own experience .i have travelled many countries , and in every case i have been exposed to new experiences that have tempered my criterion and made me more open to people s views , ideas and approaches .since i try to befriend people from the places i visit , this insight turns even more vivid for me as i am able to share a much more personal experience by doing so .during one of my trips i faced the problem of having to deal with individuals who were always affraid of taking risks and doing things differently .however , after talking to them , i finally convinced them of approaching life with a different view , so they realized that they were able to experience much more personal satisfaction by doing things differently and by deciding freely how to deal with a particular topic .in closing this presentation , i ponder upon the fact that many of us who work in banking tend to present our ideas in an overwrought manner , and that in claryfing our views we end up complicating them even further .however , in analyzing the complex issue of trying new things and taking risks , i also do not want to appear simplistic , but instead try to maintain my presentation candid and simple , convinced of martin fisher s quote that `` knowledge is a process of piling up facts , wisdom lies in their simplification .
