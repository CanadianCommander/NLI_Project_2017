it is such a hard thing to predict whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there is today or not .there are so many factors leading to the decrease in the number of cars .some of these factors are the ever increasing oil price , the scarcity of gasoline and the high cost of car maintenance .however , there are other factors promoting the use of cars and thus will result in more number of cars in the future .in my opinion , i think that the number of cars wo nt decrease .in fact , i think that there will be more cars in the future , than there are today .one reason that may lead to the increase in the number of cars used , is the increasing number in population .the number of people is increasing world wide , and lots of countries are having population control problem .so , the more people there is , the more the need for cars and transport services .another reason is the advancement in science .scientists are finding new energy sources that are abundant , less pollutant and cheap .having a cheap energy source decreases the running cost of owning a car , and thus encourages more people to purchase and own cars .moreover , having this source as clean and not a pollutant for the air or the environment will make it easier in terms of regulations to obtain a car .last but not least , the advancement in technology is another key reason .advancement in technology will increase the number of cars significantly .with technology advancing , car manufacturers are able to lower their cost of production for cars .thus , it will be possible to produce cheaper cars in shorter periods of time .also , the advancement in technology makes it possible for governments to be able to build more bridges and to maintain healthy roads to accomodate more cars .to sum up , its like a supply and demand issue .with the advancement in science and technology , resulting in increase in supply , and the increasing number of poplulation , resulting in increase in demand , owning a car will be easy and effective .so , in twenty years from now , there will be more cars in use than there are today .
