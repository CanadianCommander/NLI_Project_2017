i definitely agree with the statement .in my point of view .the willingness and determination on trying new things and taking risks are significant the the successful people .there are couple of reasons to support my view .to begin with , i think nothing is impossible .to make my point clearer , i mean sometimes if you do not try new things , you would not know you actually can achieve the goal .for my own experience , i had attended an outward bound course last summer .everyone were forced to take a harsh task .that was to jump into the sea on the ship .everyone was shocked as that time as i remembered .but in the end , all the members , including myself did finish the task .we were all so proud of ourselves .to other people , it seemed nothing to them .but in our heart , we knew that it was once a successful experience we had .apart from that , taking risk is a must for you to succeed .everything do exist a risk .in my own experience , as i would like to improve my badminton skills in order to compete for an award in a competition , i had pay extra effort on my daily practise before i have the competition .what is so risky to me is that , practise much more time than other normal days would have a greater chance to get injured .at the end , of course i did nt get hurt , but it pave the way to my succeed-the champion of that competition .finally , i would like to raise one more example .that is the man who invented microsoft .when he was studying his first year in the university , he decided to left school and concentrated on developing the ideas of microsoft .he was oringinally already good at computer and to fulfilm his dream , he ignored the risk of ca nt graduate in the university .and of course , his development on the software was so successful that almost everyone were using the software he invented .to conclude , if you think you ca nt achieve a goal without trying and taking risks , you will definitely not to be succeed in your future .
