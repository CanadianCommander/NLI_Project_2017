students have their own way of learning and understanding , but not all have the same way of doing it .some people think that it is more important to understand the facts .others may think that undestanding ideas and concepts is a better way of learning ; for me , it is better to undestand ideas and concepts .many students say that learning facts is muh better because of many reasons .firstly because you are having more details about a topic , by this they say that you are learning more .also they say that by having more details , tey are going to have more information in their minds and probably better marks .finally , they think that they are better , but the question is : are you really learning all those details ?people only learn it if they really like the topic , otherwise , they learn it for some more knoledge that in the end may be gone .by the other hand , there are students that think that understanding ideas and concepts is much better for undestanding a topic .commonly it is much easier for them to have the idea of what they have learn .another reason why they use to only undestand the idea and concept is because you probably learn for your hole life , for example things that now may no exist more or history that it is essential important for pesonal knowledge .as a last reason , is that even though you do not have learn all the topic you are certain that you have learn something .for me , it is better to understand the ideas and the concepts because you really learn from it .i think that because of the reasons given in the last paragraphs .something i always said was : why are we learning so much facts if in the end we are going to use probably only the 10 % of it ?you tell me .
