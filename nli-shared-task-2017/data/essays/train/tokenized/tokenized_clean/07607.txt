it is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .our society tends to put older people in the corner and to see them as depressed and useless .such general point of view is misleading and i personally do not agree with the statement .i will discuss why young people are considered to be happier than older and to explain why i do not agree wth the statement .first of all , young people experience a lot of new emotions , both positive and negative , that are considered very positively in our minds .secondly , the physical strength of a young person allow them to do extraordinary things .nevertheless , experiencing a lot of emotion or being very strong does not imply being happy and it is not what older people are looking for .in my opinion , older people do not need strong emotions or extraordinary thing to feel happy .in general they choose to do what they really want to do .in fact with their experience they are able to enjoy life simply reading a book or visiting a museum , things that are generally not considered exciting by young people .i think that this changement is due to a physiologic evolution of the brain throughtout life and to the capability of understanding their own limits as well as their own source of pleasure .in conclusion , i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people , but i just believe that older people enjoy their lives simply in a different way .as i wrote above this is strictly bound to the fact that human mind changes during life as well as human being does .
