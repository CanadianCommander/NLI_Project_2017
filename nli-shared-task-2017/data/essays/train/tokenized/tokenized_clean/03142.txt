since the beginning of 90 s , technology is developing with an incredebale speed and it has been developed with this speed in many areas .we talked about the technology s speed .but what about the real speed ?for many years technology s main concern was always speed .in our modern world speed plays a key role in every field .speed means time and time is cash .speed means efficiency .speed means so many important things nowadays .so what did technology do about speed ?we began our journey with finding the wheels .and then everything has changed .we invented trains .and then cars and then planes and now we have even space shuttles .but from all of these vehicles , cars are the most important ones .the use of the cars has increased during the years and now , nearly every people in the u.s have at least one car .cars helped and made the things easier for us .but what will happen after two decades from now ?are we going to use same old , slow cars ?are we going to use that kind of vehicle while speed will be much and much important ?i dont think so .first of all , as i said before , speed will be much more important .and there are enviromental problems too .there are so many cars and they are polluting our air .also there is a energy problem .our planet s limited resources wont be enough to support that much energy in the near future .from my humble point of view , the cars will be useless within twenty years .we will find and we will have to find much rapid vehicles , we will have to find ecologic vehicles and we will have to find vehicles that transport large masses and use less energy .simply , we will and we will have to find more sustainable vehicles .because we have to improve our selves and civilization and in the meantime we have to protect our planet .
