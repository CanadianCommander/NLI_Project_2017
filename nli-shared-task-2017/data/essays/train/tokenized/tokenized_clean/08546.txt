i disagree with the statement , because i think , that older people enjoy their life more .the problem is the definition of the word enjoy .in my opinion is `` enjoy your life  not , to do everything i could do in the less time a day spend .furthermore it is to select the important things , that take you further or let you become more lucky .young people sleep only less hours and use the time to make party , do a lot of sport or hang around .that s their definition of enjoy life .the older ones have more experience in their life , because they are older and they also were young .as they were young they tested everything , too .and now , they know what kind of sport , cultural living , meetings they need to be lucky .so they can concentrate themself on the real `` funny side of life  .i think , that young people not enjoy life more than older ones do .i think , they are looking for the right answer , of what is the best thing i could do with my time .on the other hand , older people normally have more money than younger ones .so they can affort expensive sports , events or other happenings , which younger ones will never seen in that way .and the main points of enjoying life are the family and long grown friendships !i heard it a lot of times , that parents and grandparents said , that the greatest , the most amazing gift is a child !and they never want to change the time they had before .and they enjoy spending time with their family or friends .that is an experience , which younger people can not understand .
