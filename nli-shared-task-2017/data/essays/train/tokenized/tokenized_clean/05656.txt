all along the day , we are surrounded by cars .they are integrated in our environment and they are part of our life .nowadays , cars have become the main way to transport humans .there are different ways to use it for the daylife or occasionally .you can use it when you go to your workplace , at school , to do shopping , or to go to holidays .however , the abusive use of the cars has led to many problems such as costs , price of oil , the depedency of arabian countries , pollution , the traffic .so , there is a dilema because we both need cars and in the same time they are destroying our planet .in the first part , we will discuss about the positive aspects of the cars , in the second part we will discuss about the drawbacks of using a car and finally we will discuss about the alternatives of the car .first of all , cars have a social and economic impact .when you have a great car , it means that you have a high salary and a high social position .cars  constructors have understood this and they want to offer to their customers the most technollogical advanced car with a high power motor and they also add some gadgets such as gps , television and other many options .the constructors made a lot of benefits on it and they have high return on investment .so , cars have a positive impact on the economy and i do nt think that the government will try to put restrictions on this .however , the government , tries to limit pollution .in france , you have not the right to use you car when there is a high level of pollution in the air .he tries to regulate the traffic and push people to use common transports such as the bus or the subway .in my opinion more and more people do nt use their car any more to avoid the traffic .there are some alternatives such as hybrid car which don  t use oil .i think this is the best solution because it is a compromise .
