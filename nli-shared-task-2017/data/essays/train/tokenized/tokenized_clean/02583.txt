the seller always need to advertisements to buy their products to human therefore the advertisement is a very important aspects of the sellers .somebody things that advertisements show the reality of the product to consumers , the others think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i agree the second idea .these are my following reasons .firstly , advertisements may have visual games .for example , the cosmetic companies use much beatiful models to attract womans to buy their products .they think the products will increase their beauty as the models .moreover , advertisements may show unrealistic details of the products us .for instance , the shampoo advertisements says they have lots of positif benefits to hairs and they show a women whose hair is so atractive but they are not full of these benefits ,in addition to this , advertisements are everywhere so we are influenced about thinking they are good .in my street there are lots of bilboard and when an advertisement about a product is on these bilboard , i see them everday and the result of this i think it is better to use .i mean that our opinions about a product are influenced by the advertisements .finally , although some products does nt worth , the advertisements increase the price of the product .so we buy something which is less quality than we expect .all in all , as i said before , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of having untrue visuality and being everywhere and they are cause of high costs .the advertisement company should be honest to improve their quality and profits because people easily understand the reality of them .
