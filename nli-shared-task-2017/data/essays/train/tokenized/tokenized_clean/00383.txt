if the youth new and if the youth is an old thought which has always been used to question the issue of this essaz .this is a controversery issue .indeed how could life be characterized to enable us to affirm that young people more enjoy it than older do .considering the interresse , expectations in life , culture and financial abilities , one would agree or not .indeed about young people , although they have the physical power and the strenght to try everything and to make new experiences , they can travel all over the world , are able to lern many things and plan for a tomorow , they still have a lot all misadventures coming and are rarelly realy fit to accept some realities and therefore go through deceptions bad sides of life .older people have gone through or have had the opportunity of going through everything live had offered to them , have made their choices and now can look over their shoulders and smile or not .in any case , for them the action part of the life belongs to history and they can enjoy other features of the life they have .rich people from reach family have a defined way and they don t need to burder for what they have to achieve .still their youth is uncertain because everything changes and they also lack of everlasting certainity .i believe one can only really enjoy when the work is done and although life can be exiting and pleasant some time , everybody always get up in the morning and start again to built up .everydaz enjozment helps us to get over but the real enjoyement is that of the older who know how thez have have done .
