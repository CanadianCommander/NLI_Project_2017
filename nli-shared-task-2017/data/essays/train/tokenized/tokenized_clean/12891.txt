the education process has evolved during recent decades .in the past decades , students were tought in a way that would only permitted them to memorize facts .the importance of education relied on accepting facts rather than understanding them .things have changed , and nowadays students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning only facts .the world demands well prepared people capable of analyzing situations , solving problems and proposing ideas .when students understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts they are able to develop a process of constant and connected learning .they are able to apply ideas and concepts at different fields and they can find relations within different subjects .they have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life .this makes the knowledge process smooth at all levels of education .students are encouraged to understan rather than simply accepting ideas .the problem with learning only facts is that it partializes the knowledge .a student would only memorize facts for a certain subject and it would not be able to find its aplicability in other fields .facts only respond to specific details and eventough they are useful , they can not constitute the pure basis for education .facts do nt permit discussion .as an example of what i have presented before we can analyze a history class .it is different to learn history learning only dates and facts that took place at a certain time , than to undestand ideas and concepts that lay behind the facts .if a student is able to see the connection between events and to undestand the conditions that gave birth to a certain fact they would undestand many of the things that take place today .as a conclusion i would say that the education process needs facts as well as undestanding ideas and concepts but the last one , is more important for developing a well constructed and supported knowledge .in my opinion , the early you give a student the possiblity to do this , the better he/she wil performed in academic life .
