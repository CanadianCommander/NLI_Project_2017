i agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are several reasons as follows which are all pointing in the same direction , less cars will be in our streets in the future .first of all , since there will be scarce amount of oil reserves there will be more public transportation as faster trains and underwater tunnels between long distances .there will be alternative and cheap substances , fuels or mechanisms to function vehicles which will be environment friendly at the same time but since research for new fuels and loss of auotomotive companies because of scarce resources of oil will cause high costs for buying alternative efficient cars .with respect to current technology and consumption preferences of people in the market , it can be assumed that in the future people will prefer easier lives than today .clearly , traffic always causes stress in poeple and sometimes makes it impossible to reach everywhere .so , new generations wo nt be prefering cars that easily .instead of going somewhere with a car in traffic , they will meet in internet , make video conferences , use audios , etc. with respect to their goals in travelling .instead of using cars , they will prefer to use air transportation which is faster .in the future , there will be new methods of air transfer , different kinds of vehicles transferring people in the air .one other point is that , in the short run , streets and parking lots will not be enough for more cars and people will start complaining about having cars which will be a sign of future generations having of less cars .another point is that in the future people will be spending more time at home causing less reasons to travel with a car like working home office and having lectures in online schools instead of traditional classes so they wo nt be going to work or school .finally , in the long run , people will find a new way to transmit molecules and bodies , so they wo nt need any other mediums of transportation .to sum up , future will bring us less cars and respectively no cars and thus happier people who are using alternative ways for transportation instead of car .
