i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .why i agree with the statement is because , when i watch tv , i can see a lot of advertisement for good things , and when i see things from advertisements at store , it does no look quiet same as that of advertisement .i like to watch tv , so i often watch a lot of advertisements on tv .i have some experiences that i wanted to get things from that of advertisement .when i was elementary school student , i saw an advertisement for a electoric staffed animal which can walk .then i really liked that staffed animal at a grance .it looked so cute and can be walked very well .since i really wanted to get that staffed animal , i asked my mother to get it for me .when i used the stuffed animal it did not walk like that of advertisement .i was so sad .i think wy most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are iss because , they want to convince a lot of people to but their products .even though they can get more money thanks to thier advertisements , they are not saying true .so i think it is not a good idia .also because of the advertisements that makes products seem much better than they really are , they can lose custommers  trusts .it s very bad for them .in addition to losing costomers s trusts , now i think a lot of people realized that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .if so , these advertisenents can be lost thier purpose of their advertisement .i think it is very important for most advertisements who make products seem much better than they really are to realize costommers  mind , and make advertisements that can be trusted by a lot of costommers .
