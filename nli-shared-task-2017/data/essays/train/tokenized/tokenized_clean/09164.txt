i agress with the statment made here .advertisment are a tool that businesses use to promote a product .it is ofcourse quite obviuos then that they will only show the positive side of a product in an an attempt to get a customer to buy it .it is not in their best interest to be honest .businesses live by the fact that they are legally allowed to lie .any advertisment has the purpose of selling .if business were truthfull about what they were selling product sales would decrease significantly .lets take for example ciggeratte advertisments .ciggerates are bad for your health .in todays world you will not find anyone to argue with this statment and be able prove their oppinion .so how do you advertise for a product like ciggerates ?how do you convince people to buy something that kills them ?clearly ciggerate manufacturers have thought about this greatly and have come up with the best answer .psychology .advertisments capitilise on human psychology understandings .an honest ciggerate commercial would cause people to avoid the product .so therfore advertisers learn about human psychology and how to attract people to something they know is bad .they highlight the package that comes with smoking rather than the ciggerate itself .there isnt a ciggerate commerical out there that convinces you to buy their product because of its taste or its feel .they get you buy it by showing you the social and status rewards of smoking their brand .like davidoff and its elegance .so when people see advertisments they sometimes remember only its social effects rather than the product itself .to me thats how advertisments can make a product seem better than it acutally is .
