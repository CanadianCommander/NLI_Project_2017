altough there are some young people who endeaver to help their community , it could nt be wrong to state that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .an old saying of my country says : `` exceptions does nt make the rule disfunction .the main reason of my supportting this statement is the way the young live , the way they behave to each other , the only intrinsic purposes for doing something and their attidutes towards older and younger alike .nearly all the young live now selfish .they contemplate only the benefits for theirselves , which they can obtain from any activity .they are unaware of the term altruism .this is observed to be continuing in accordance with the technology .the faster the technological inventions are made , the more selfish the people are .the computers , the televisions and same functioning facilities are the prisons of younger , but the difference is they are happy there .everything in order to be done for being beneficial to the community does nt interest them , because they are happy in their prisons .their attitudes towards the others is really affected by the guardians in these prisons as well .and everybody knows who the guardians are .to sum up , the young are uninterested to the social problems , however whose guilt this is , is obvious : technological improvements and us , who could not obey this inventions and who let them be the most important part of our lives .
