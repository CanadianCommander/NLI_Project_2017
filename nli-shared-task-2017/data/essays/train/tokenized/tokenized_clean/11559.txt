knowledge , is the ammount of stuff we know .many people just study one specific subject while others get more information .by specializing in one subject you will know many things but only in that subject .if you know allot of knowledge you can have a better conversation with someone .i think that by knowing more things about the world and what is around you , poeple have a better image of how you are and you can have a better conversation .there are many ways how to get more knowledge .for example , you start reading many books of many different topics and learn by yourself at your home .also , you can go study more things like study one subject but you can go further and study other stuff that in some way they are linked together with the first thing you studied .in my opinion i think that having allot of knowlege about many things is a really importarnt thing to have in your life .even as you are growing up you should watch shows that have education and read books that have important information .while trying to have a conversation with a person who only knows something about one specific subject you will have an interesting conversation only if you talk about the subject that person knows .in the other hand , if you try to have a conversation with someone who knows many stuff about the things that is around us you will have a very enjoying conversation .i really think knowing something about only one subject its not good at all .learning is not really expensive if you know how to do it ( like reading books ) and it is not a crime or bad for you to know many things .everyone should read everyday and if possible study for many years .
