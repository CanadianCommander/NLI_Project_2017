there exists an opinion that young people nowadays do not tend to spend enough time to helping their communities .indeed , i agree with this statement .first of all , the notion of individualization has taken over in modern times and consequently among the young generation .young people place more value on individual interests than they do on the interests of the community they are in .as a result they tend to devote an appreciable amount of time to their own works and private lives .this in turn , as may easily be guessed , does not leave much time for them to do something for their communities .moreover , the lives of young people became much more difficult than they were in the past .by the word ` difficult  i mean that the conditions that face the young generation are more cruel and competitive .the world population and hence the amount of young people increases year by year .therefore , in order to achieve something in life , the representatives of the young generation have to work much harder and concentrate more on their own interests .in other words , they just do not have time to be engaged in helping their communities .i would like to bring my life as an example .i want to become a successful scientist in the future .however , nowadays there is an appreciable amount of students who would like to pursue a scientific career - especially in my field ( genetics ) .therefore , in order to ` outweigh my rivals  i have to work quite hard and have very little time to help my parents , relatives or friends .furthermore , helping someone else in general and the community in particular should involve a great sense of responsibility .however , as far as i could observe the members of the current young generation usually lack that .in other words , they do not want to take responsibility for someone else and hence do not tend to help that ` someone else  .in conclusion , i would like to mention that in view of the reasons and the example stated above , i certainly think that at our times young people do not spend a reasonable amount of time devoted to helping their communities .
