in university , students have both to undestand ideas and concepts and to learn facts .in my point of view , these two things are totally complementary in a student learning-process .it is true that , depending on the area of studies , it is sometimes more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts , or in contrary , more important to learn facts .for example , a student in history will have to learn a lot of facts and dates to be able to talk about a war .if you do nt know these , you are not able to explain them .learning facts happens first , and understanting ideas , after .mathematics or even economics students would rather say that it is more important for them to understand a theory or a concept than learning facts .if you understand an idea you can thing about it , re-use the idea , or even learn from previous mistakes than have been made in the past .after that , it could be interesting to learn when a theory has been though or where .moreover , if you understand something very well first , then it is easier to remember facts about it .for instance , when i was in high school , i had lot of difficulties in learning facts and dates in history , especially concerning the cold war .after speaking to an older student , i realised that i was nt able to memorize the facts because i did nt understand how it happens and why .after understanding something , you sometimes remember everything without ever noticing it .in my opinion , understand and learning are both important for a student .however , during all the years of studies , students have to learn to think , to take decision , to learn from mistakes , not only in order to find a job , but also in their everyday life .because studying is not only being able to learn facts but it is also the development from a child to an adult , i agree that understand ideas and concepts is the more important .
