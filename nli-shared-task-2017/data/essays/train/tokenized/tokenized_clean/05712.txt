i agree about this topic .most people want to acheive what they are doing .and they do nt satisfy about that .they continue to try new things and they wants more things .for example , in my country we have `` samsung  company .and it is biggest company in my country .they are trying a lot of things even they are the biggest campany in the country .today another countries use samsung compant too .this campany is already international company .but , they are continue trying for another things .i think this become to be biggest company .if people already got a successful life , so they stop what are they doing .then another people will break things and be higher .for example , i know a one preson like this case .he regent about things .and trying to be a better life .but it is hard to built that he made .everybody have to try new things , and do hard about what they have .i think people have to be more polite when they have a successful life .and have to work hard .human do nt satisfy about one things .in my case i do nt satisfy one thing that i did successfuly .i find new things and i want to achieve that successfully .even the animals do something successfully they find another things to do .and they wants better life than before .everybody in the world wants successful life and they wil continue to try new things .for this reason we are living better life than before .if they did nt try new things , than our life will not be different 200 years ago and now .therfor , in my opinion i agree about this topic .and i will also continue to try new things .
