most people s purpose is success in their area .however everyone can not succeed in thier part .because for this success , people have to compete each other to get it .but if people want to succeed , they have to try their own idea and work harder than the others .so , i agree and the reasons are follow .first , people have to create their own idea and try or embody in their work .everyone can do easy or general things .to predominate their abilities , they have to make and show .especially , in design area , many designer have to dream their design theory and make the result , but every time , their design does not accept .because somebody hate and think that it is unreasonable design .but designsers have to retry another newone .and then they can get the reward from hard work .second , the risks are could be the good chances to evaluate their ability .people s ability can be better after bitter experiences .because they can learn many things from their fails .and next time , they rarely do the same mistakes and also they make more evaluated result .in my case , i alway learn from my mistakes and i thought i had no ability to make creative design .but i did nt give up and i can realise the smart way to think next time for better .in conclusion , if you want to succeed , you have to consider your fail and risk .but people do nt have to think the negative result .however try a new idea and do their best is meaningful .and result shows what they did for their success. a fpart from result we can get many things from this try .
