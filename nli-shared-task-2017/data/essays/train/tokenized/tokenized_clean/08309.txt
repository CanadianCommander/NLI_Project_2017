some people claim young people live a more valuable and interesting life than the older people do .the other people , however take the opposite point of view .in my opinion , i believe older people can enjoy life more than young people do .i shall set forth two major reasons in support of this .firstly , older people normally know the meaning of life better than the youth .they have richer life experiences and from which they have learnt what kind of things are worth doing .in this way they are more likely to spend their time on the pursuits more valuable .by pursuing these precious goals , their life are full of meaning and have more fun than some young `` couch potatoes  who do not know where they should go .for an instance , i used to live with an old lady for a while .she was eighty years old , but she kept making baby clothes everyday for the children in orphanage .she considered it as considerably valuable , and thus she greatly enjoyed the way she lived her life .so older people gain more life experiences through years and generally know deeper about the meaning of life , which brighten their life .secondly , young people are more likely to enjoy their life in more superficial way .it is easy to see that a lot of teenagers indulge in video games and tv programs which keep them from sophiscated thinking .they are easily attracted by superficial pleasures and the life they enjoy is less valuable than the life with deliberate considerations and long-term plans which older people normally make .in brief , older people can live a more meaningful life and thus enjoy life with higher quality than some young people do .therefore , from my point of view , older people can live a more joyful life than young people do .
