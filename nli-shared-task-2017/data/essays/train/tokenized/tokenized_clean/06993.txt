i disagree with that statement .nowadays , a lot of highschool students look for summer jobs as soon as their academic year ends .those jobs consist of helping out in various stores in a shopping mall , performing simple tasks in a clinic , or catering in a restaurant , or hosting an event and there are lots more .it also depends on the what type of young people the statement is referring to .if it is referring to spoiled , rich teenagers then i would understand , since all they have been taught to do is to just request whatever they wish for without earning it .although , there are several other cases which young people are normal students who recieve average amount of pocket money every month given by their parents .at a certain point , those young people soon realise that the pocket money most of the times will not be enough to get what they need or want .that is when they start working and looking for jobs even at a hospital for the elderly .most of the job vacancies out there are being occupied by young teenagers , and they are actually more enthuisiastic than older people when they go through their job .most of my classmates in college always volunteer to help out with charity work .the amount of students who actually showed up to donate and help out with organising was so shocking that the older members were extremely impressed .in my point of view , younger people are far more creative at organising an event especially for younger people s interests .for instance , when it comes to organising a music concert in order to collect the money for donation , it is always done best by a young person in his or her late teens , since they know what type of music and who the younger generation likes to listen to nowadays .that way the concert will turn out to be successful and they could earn a good amount of money for charity .
