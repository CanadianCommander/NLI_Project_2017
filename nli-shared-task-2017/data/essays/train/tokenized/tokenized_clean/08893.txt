the qualityfor the considering the universities , it is unbelievable that this problem of the university is keep going for very few years at least in my country , i think it takes a lot of year to cope this problem too .in my country the specializing in one specific subject is more spreaded for the university , and my opinion is parallel with this idea .in terms of the universities or in companies , this statement which i agree with is more useful .as an instance of this situation is that in lectures according to a student for the taking the course from a person who is specialized on that course is so much educated rather than the taking from the person who is not really interested in that course that much .in addition by this way the quality of the educating is certainly rise up .this is also undeniable that in order to graduating from the universities you have to be successfull all over the lectures that you took in .this already means that when you finished oyur school you already have many broad knowledge about the department you have .shortly this seperated educations is involve so much inefficient for the rest of life of the students .to sum up , by the increasing the people who specialized in one specific subject , make our country or our world in a high position , and i think this is not a dream and this may come real .
