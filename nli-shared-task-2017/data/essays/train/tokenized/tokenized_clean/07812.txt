according to the task to discuss wether travelling in a group led by a tour guide might be the best way to travel i would like to say that first of all it is one of the most comon ways of travelling .especially japanese are often seen travalling in a huge group .me myself i like to travel alone and disagree because of that with that statement .when travel alone you are independent and you can make your plan by yourself .in big groups you have to do what everybody wants to do or if there is a tour guide what he planned .most of the time there are no exceptions .being alone also means that you get to no other people maybe native people , maybe other visitors .but on the other hand i like a mix of both like taking a tour guide for a day or travelling with others who are interested in seeing the same things or places .i already traveled alone by myself and it was the best experience i have ever made .although i made trips with friends , groups or my family before i had never so much fun .if you come to a town were you do not know even one person i will have to talk to stragers .and besides i am shy i got to know many people which i would have never met if had been travelling in a group .i made trips with them , what explains that i do not disagree striktly with this statement .what i am sure about is that you learn much more about the country you go to , as if you had gone with a guided group , if you prepare yourself a little .most of the times you can barely find a tour guide which is right qualified to tell you more fact , than if you had informed yourself by books .some might say that this is not true , but i just talk according to the experience i made .`` but is not more safe if you travel in a group ?  some might ask .i have the opinion that if you do not take to much risk and if you care a little for yourself , you will travel at least with the same safety .on the other hand groups of tourist are easier aims of terrorist attacks because the follow a strict plan and are easy to hit .but in general i just like to travel no matter how !
