success is really one of the most important issues for many people all over the world .some people tend to do what they already know to do well .others tend to try new things and take risks to do well .personally , i believe that trying new things and taking risks are really imortant in a person s success .on the other hand , there are those who belive that doing what one knows is better than doing what he does nt know .they believe that it is saftey for a person to do what he knows , because he dose nt know what will happen if he tries something new .the arab news mentioned a survey last month about the people who tend to do what they know .they made an interview with some of them .they think that it is better to do what you know , because one does nt know what results will hapeen if they try something new .in contrast , many people believe that changing is really important in people s lives .they have to take risks and try things that they did nt try before .they cite research on achievement saying that most of the successful people tend to do things that they did nt used to do .they can face the problem that they mau face in thier lives .in addition , they can get what they want easilly .so , they can deal with the life  s hardships greatly .in conclusion , success is really an important issue .the plenty of people believe that one should try what de does nt try , because he may never taste the life if he dose nt face its difficulties .so , they think that the right decision to do what one did nt try before .personally , i believe taht without trying one can not taste the life .
