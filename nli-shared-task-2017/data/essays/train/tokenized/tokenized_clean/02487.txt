advertisement is the motor for each company , it is like a front screen for its product .but sometimes companies may lie and give wrong information about the producuct .when you turn on a television , the first thing you see is advertisement .befor every events , the thing that influence you is advertisement .but do we know what is it ?how true is this information ?each company try to have the best product , get more money , but they do not want to spend dollars to reach that goal .when a product is not well know or customers do not like it , the company change that by advertisement specially an attractive one that can influence customers and push them to buy it .nowadays , most of people do not trust them .because you can see an advertisement for a product saying that it can help you to sleep , but when you try it it does not change nothing .just lies .so more people lost their confidence on publicity , and prefer to stay with one product that they are sure is efficient and will never change it .i had my own experience with it .few months ago , i saw an advertisement for a new kind of food , saying is so delicious , new combination , and a lot of others good things .i was so influenced , that pushed me to try it .but unfortuntly , i was disapointed .it tastes horrible .when a company make advertisement , they always show the good side and never what is wrond with the product .this method was helpfull few years ago when people thougth that everything they saw was true .but not any more , people try to be sure what they are buying , and ask about it befor getting it .sometimes , people get influenced by what they are watching .companies make new ideas such as always get a funny advertisement about care , have sexy girls in man s product , and children for candies and food .they also focus on special generation commontly kids because of theire innocence .however , companies make to influence people , the truth is the best way to do it .as long there are liers , there is correct person .
