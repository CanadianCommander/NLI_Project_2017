understanding ideas and concepts and leraning facts are important for students .however , in my opinion , i disgree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .to begin with , we can learn ideas and concpets in class and our teacher , but sometimes they do nt work in the real society .for example , i worked in one restaurant before .when i cook the fish by following the recipes which our teacher taugh me , the chef blamed me .he said , `` customers wo nt like what you cook by this way .the fact improved what he said is right because the people who ate the dishes i cooked went to complained to my boss .i was upset and depressed .from that day , i do nt believe the recipets i took in my class .in addition , sometimes facts is very cruel , but we need to accept them .that s the reason why i regard facts are more important .for instance , i almost lost my job when i cooked the awful dishes by following the recipets .my boss told me that the fact was whatever you cooked , the most important thing was the customers liked it , especailly about work .what he said made me trust fact is the most significant factor again .in short , i learned the precious lesson by realistic and painful experience .i would nt say that understanding ideas and concepts are useless or not important ; however , i really believe that it is more importnat for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .
