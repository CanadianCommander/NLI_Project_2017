before thinking about the truthfullness of advertisement , one has to distinguish between the different forms of advertising .to keep this essay short i will focus on two forms , informative advertising and emotional advertising .emotional advertisement tries to connect certain emotions and a certain image with a specific product .for example marlborough cigarettes have always been associated with freedom .because of this definition of emotional advertising , it can not be truthfull or untruthfull .people will buy a product because it evokes certain feelings and emotions .in effect the advertisement of certain products is actually part of the product itself .the reason for this is that most people would not buy a product such as a louis vuitton handbag if it would nt have an image of luxury connected to it .this image of luxury is only upheld by advertisement .only the customers know at the end if the image and the emotions they acquired are as good as suggested by the advertisement .i do not think this can be generalised in emotional advertisement .informative advertisement on the other hand informs the potential customers about a certain product , in order to convince them that it is the best product they can get .this form of advertisement can of course be truthfull or untruthfull .by witholding facts about a product or by actually lying about a product it is possible for firms to get an advantage over their competitors .but in general , lies do not last very long .it is not wise for companies to raise expectations they can not uphold .if a company dissapoints its customers they will never buy this companies products again .in my opinion companies exaggerate the benefits of their products only so much as is expected by the customers .customers expect advertisement to be moderately exaggerated and are not dissapointed if they buy such a product .so in my opinion advertisements do not make products seem much better than they are , because customers expect advertisements to be exaggarated .
