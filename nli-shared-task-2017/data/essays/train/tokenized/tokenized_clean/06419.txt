i disagree with this statement .i would like talk about my opinion with 3 reasons .the first , it is problem about feelings of us , humans .we already know the eirth has a lot of enviromental problems .i think co2 is a most famous reason of distroyeding the earth , so using a car is a big reason , too .however we already know how a using car is so convinience .if the famouse people or gorvanment said `` stop using a car !!  , we ca nt do it .the second , it is problem in the developed counties .i said about the car which made co2 , but now they are reaserching some ecology cars in some company , forexsample hybrit-car .those are already famous , and sometime we can see this car in my city , but it is expensive than normal cars .in the other hand , there are some problems in the butteries , too .some of people worry how we charge any enelgies .if resarchers make more serveys or think more useful ideas , those will are used more people .then , how about the developping countries .the last reason is problem of the developping countries .some of the place in the developping county , there are no an airport or a train .the people who live in like this erea use only a track or a car .if they can not use those , they ca nt transport some foods or things .i think some ereas must develop to inprove own country s economy of situation , so transportations are most important to develop .and this problem is not only this .the developed countries send a lot of used car which is ofcorsed making co2 for the developping countries too cheep .those will be more inreasing .this his problem is not only the developping countries bout also the developped countries .therefore i dissagree .
