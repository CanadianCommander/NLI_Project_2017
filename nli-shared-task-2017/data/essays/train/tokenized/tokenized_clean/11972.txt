some people think it is for them to learn fact , but others think it is more important for students to understand idears and concepts personally , i agree this is very important to studants .among them many reason , the most important is that students develop their technology and ideas .it is better that the students have more deep thinking and responsibility .forexample , my cousin is 12years old .although he has many books , he do nt understand many part exately math .so his mother bought one book about understand idears and concepts .he enjoy the book and always try to understand anything .right now he like math .to conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
