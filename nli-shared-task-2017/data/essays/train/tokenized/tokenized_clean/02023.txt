an advertisement is something that present people new products .these products can be cars , lipsticks , foods and many other things .they can be seen in newspapers , magazines or on television .people , who prepare them , give a certain shape to these new products so that they can be seen more attractive to people .actually , the problem begins here because this may lead to the fact that advertisements may make products seem much better than they really are .in order to testify the validity of this argument , it is better to analyze it with an example .a famous car producer designed a new car for people who are married and have children .in order to attract their target market , the car producers make a deal with an advertising agent .the agent prepares an advertisement that will be shown on tv .in this advertisement , the most beautiful and thin housewife who gave birth just two months ago and his very handsome husband go into their new car with their very cute children .the car , although it is designed for middle-class families looks like a bmw in order to emphasize its excellence .at the end , this wonderful middle-class family who owns this car , which looks like a bmw , lives happily ever after .this example may sound a bit exaggerated but this is the case that is created by advertisements .in advertisements usually everything seems in their best shape .the women , men , babies look always perfect , which can not be realistic .i am wondering how many women , who gave birth just two months ago can be so thin as the woman in the advertisement appears .also , the products seem much more better than their real shape .most of the people who are attracted by this car advertisement go to the shops and think that they will have a car that is more luxurious than it seems .however , this is not the case because when they see the car by themselves , they are disappointed because the car is in reality much more modest .all in all , these do not mean that advertisements are not necessary .on the contrary , they are very useful for people to know new products but this should not be in the form of convincing them .advertisements should reflect the truth about the products so that people are not disappointed .
