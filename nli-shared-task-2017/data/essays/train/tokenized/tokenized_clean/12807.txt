have you ever heard about the word like `` pal-bang-mi-in  ?this word is from korea , and it means that good at a lot of things .as we can know that old saying , the society prefer to be good at many things rather than good at only one thing .there are three reasons that why we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first of all , various knowledge make people can talk with others freely and flexible .if someone specialize in one specific things , he can not talk with other things freely .for example , i am a person who has lots of interst with only reading books , and do not have any time to watch a tv .however , when my friends start to talk with tv programs , or movie star , i can not join with them .secondly , it can help you to understand many things at once .considering only one thing can not help people to think other things .however , when you know even a little part of a broad knowledge with others , it can help you to know how others going on .also , you can know that the progress of the society or other things .lastly , you can learn many things easily as many as possible based on the broad knowledge .when you know about a little in something , you already know the basic of those things , and know how they organized , so you might know the direction of their ways .however , if you do not know about some materials even a little , then you have to start to know those things from the beginnig , and it will be harder than start with basic knowledge .to sum up , i would recommand that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .it can help us to have conversation with others freely and flexible , understand many things at once , and learn many things easily as many as possible compared knowing nothing .it is a real information age nowadays , and we do not need to specialize in one specific subject any more .the age changed , and we should change to know broad things and start with get broad knowledge .
