being bill gatessuccess is an important thing for modern human and there are lots of description of success .but everyone wants to be successful in life , from a housewive to a scientist .in my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well , because there is new opportunities , chance to develop themselves and bigger success than traditional one in trying new things and taking risks .first of all , new ways always offer new opportunities to people .for example , in 1980s there is no computer industry ; there is only special computers which are used in special centers such as nasa or fbi .but nowadays computers are everywhere , in our pockets with our cellphones !a man , named bill gates , become the richest person in the world who took risk and made a new computer program which is called windows .windows is an easy computer program for ordinary people to use the computer in daily life and it was a revolution for computers .secondly , trying new things gives person a chance develop himself .for making a new thing people must research and learn new things .researching process can be so effective for learning and developing new things is also developing people s themselves .people think and see new thing which are not important for them before .in addition , traditional ways give people traditional success .there is no chance for big and important success .but in taking risks there is tremendous success .in ordinary way makes ordinary job , no one remember your name at the end .
