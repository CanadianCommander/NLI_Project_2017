i definitely disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because i know that a lot of young people work for their communities as volunterre .i would like to offer some examples to support my opinion .first , there are a large number of students at my university who are interested in helping their communities .for exmple , when i went to the volunterre meeting at the university a few days ago , although it was still on summer vacation , the meeting room was packed with students who wanted to volunterre .i was so exited to see and know that the number of students made time for the meeting .it shows the fact that there are a lot of young studets who are interested in helping their communities and make time for it .second , i know that a lot of my freinds are working for volunterre already .moreover , at the meeting of this kind , i have seen a lot of young people who join for volunterre including from different universities , locations and backgrounds .if young people have not given enought time to supporting their communities acitively these days how come i have seen these people ?also i know that they are not only suppoting their communities but also they are willing to do it .they feel more reponsible to the community through the acitivity .doing these activities give them a lot of satisfation as a member of communities and society .for these reasons , i disagree the idea strongly that young people today do not make enought time to helping their communities .furthermore , as long as i know , they participate more to help their communities .
