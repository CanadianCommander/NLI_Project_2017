the number of cars that we can see every day in the street is incredibly huge .cars are very usefull to move quickly from a place to another and quite every family seems to be able to afford one or even two or three of this means of transportation .people do nt seem to be able to find another way to move so confortable like this !of course there are some aspects related to the use of cars that in my opinion may influence the future .one of this is the price of oil or fuel .this is a great proplem that nowadays all the world is facing .prices seem to grow more and more every day and if the situation will not change , if all the countries wo nt find a solution , people will be able to afford cars no more .another aspect related to this is the fact that petrol will not be available forever .in fact this natural resorse will end , not in twenty years , but surelly in a future not so distant from our time .so men has to think to a possible solution , for example electrical cars or other means of transport to substitute cars .there are even negative aspects related to the use of cars .fuel or oil , which cars need to work , are the first causes of air pollution .our governamnets are tring to find a solution to this problem , introducing days during wich cars are not allowed to be used : but it may be possible that in the future only a small number of cars would be allowed to circulate in order to reduce pollution .
