i believe that young people have the possibility to enjoy life much more than older ones .youngs usually have few phisycal constraints and see death and diseases much further than they actually are .old people additionally have the disadvantages of living in a world that has changed much since their time .one reason i think that people have higher opportunities of enjoying their lives when they are younger is that they are healthy and strong .they can live freely without worries for the future : they can try exciting sports like bunjee jumping or rock climbing .instead old men and women have to spend much of their time ( and money ) in visits at the doctor s .many diseases related to elderly requires the use of drugs and medicines they would not be able to live without .while youngs have no time to spend thinking about risks , the old men and women are often not even independent : they need somebody s assistance .secondly the old people are living in an environment they are not even able to recognize !the world changes so fast that grandfathers and grandmothers are unable to understand the social behaviours of their grandchildren .i ve often tried to explain my grandmother the reason i do nt want to get married , but she just ca nt understand it !another aspect of this can be observed when comparing the number of old people who are able to use a computer with the number of electronic games sold to even some very young children .morever i truly believe that the most stimulating part of one s life is the university time .it is the period of my lifetime where i m increasing mostly the size of my knowledge and experience .everyday i meet new persons and i have the possibility to find many very interesting .for example some professors are so wise that just the possibility to talk with them five minutes is a great chance .not many places are as precious as universities .thus i am sure that people can enjoy life more and better when they are young than when they are old .i do nt think having a longer life is a good bargain : there is no point in leaving 100 years if the second half of it has to be passed on a bed or a chair dreaming about the past time or asking somebody to turn on the television .
