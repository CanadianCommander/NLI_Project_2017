why do we have to help our communities giving our free time , if it is not cool anymore ?unfortunately , this question is thought by many of nowadays young people .the community is always going to need some type of help from everyone at any moment , therefore if we have nothing to do in our free time .should nt we be giving up some of this time for the common wealth of the society ?eventhough , young people have enough time to do many worthless and pointless things , they never decided to opt to help people who need a lot help .why ?nowadays , the majority prefers to get rid of contributing on the communities  social problems , since they are already very busy with their own worries , such as , hanging out with their friends next week-end , plannig the friday s party , etc . ..helping to someone else requires a high degree of responsability that not every young person is able to achieve , hence many people does not even think about the idea of getting into that job .young people mainly think that supporting the community with some kind of subsidies or donations of money , instead of giving more freely time , are big enought to resolve the origin of the problem .however , it is well known that helping our community represents a big deal , since it forces us to change a lot of our daily activities .at the beginning , it might seem rare for us beacuse we might feel lost and without having any idea of what to do or help for , but as long as we get use to it will be pretty easy , and besides it will turn into a habbit .therefore , at the end there are more benefitial reasons to decide to give more time to help the community rather than not helping it .in conclusion , since i work for one charity , as the time passes , you start realizing that helping community is won
