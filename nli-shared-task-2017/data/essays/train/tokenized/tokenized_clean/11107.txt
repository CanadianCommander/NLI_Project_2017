the issue that in twenty years the number of cars in use will raise or drop is difficult to deal with because there are different arguments involved .some people think that there will be fewer cars because of the environmental impact in wich the use of cars is sued .on the contrary the increase of the number of cars in use can be partly justified because the number of inhabitants on earth is still raising very fast .most importantly , rejecting co2 cars are responsible in a wide proportion for the atmosphere pollution .every body knows the consequences of a high grade of co2 in the atmosphere ; warmer temperature , climate changes and so on .so most of the governments , acting for the well being of its citizens , are writing new laws and inventing new solutions tending to reduce the use of cars .for instance , in paris , during the summer , only the pair or unpair patterns number are allowed to circulate .secondly , we can stress the lack of petroleum or gas resources today , and the raise of pump prices .as cars are big users of petrol , their utilisation involve that car owners have the financial power to pay it .as the resources are not eternal and prices are getting higher and higher , it seems as an evidence that the number of users will decrease in the next twenty years .another important argument would be that the automotive industry is very big enrgy consumer .indeed , to make a car requires lots of products such as platsics or iron wich consumes a lot of energy to get in available form .then the assembly chains , mostly composed by automatic machines consumes also a lot of energy .so , in the next years , governments will probably realise that providing very efficent popular transports would have a good impact on the country energy consumption .to conclude , my strong belief is that even if the populattion is growing all around the world , the trend of environmental legislations in the prevalent car using countries will be to decrease the production and the traffic of this type of vehicles in the next twenty years .
