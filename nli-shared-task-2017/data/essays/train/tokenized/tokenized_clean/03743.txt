about a couple of years ago , my friend and i went trip to australia and newzealand for 2 weeks .we went in a group of 20 people led by a korean tour guide .people in a group including us visited the same places at a time and we had a same meal everytime .i thought that it was totally ridiculous and i paid money in vain .we could nt even enjoy things that we could have .it is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip .there is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide .first of all , it just gets rid of my interests about the touring places .a tour guide tells us everything , and we should go places only where the tour guide leads us .there can be many things that i am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out .as far as i am concerned , i usually search some informations before i do something .in fact , i did nt know that i am supposed to go in a group .i expected that i go with my friends i found many informations about the australia and newzealand such as famous places , fees that i have to pay , the climates , transportations and so on . .and i prepared some plan to go and have some special meals .but it was just a dream .if we go trips not in a group , but indivually , we could go places where we wanted .we could do things flexibly and do nt have to take up useless time .it makes me have foods that i really wanted .there are many things to see that we need to take some time .it simply enables us to do it .going individually could really help us enjoy the whole trip .
