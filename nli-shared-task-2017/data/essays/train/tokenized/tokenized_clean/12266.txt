the way that the young and the old living their lives are totally different nowadays in china .and what i agree is young people do enjoy life mor than older people do .maybe the most important reason is that young people spend more money .almost every young students have some technological instrument , such as cd player , digital camera , mobile phone , mp3 player , or even mp4 player .but that s not so popular in adults .they may only have a very old type mobile phone .the computers in everyhome have almost become toys for the children , the only function is to play game .compared to my classmates , i m a saving boy , but compared to my parents , i m wasting .once , when i was having lunch at a out-door restraunt near my schol , many adults passed me by .what they do is just leave , because they think it was too expensive .another unforgettable reason may be the different style of education we get .our parents were told to save when they were at school .save , save , save .all they knew was to save , and they really met some problem , which `` save  really helped them .but what i learn is `` enjoy your life !  , so i do .i enjoy my life so much that what i have enjoyed maybe more than my parents .also , love is a factor , maybe someone will ignore .adults have many people for them to love .their husbands or wives , children , parents .but for we , we only love ourselves .we have nt got so many people to love , and we are still do nt know how to love , and who to love .so the olders want the people they love to enjoy their lives , not themselves , which is completely different from us .last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca nt enjoy , such as some physical sports , such as football , basketball and some dangerous stuff .so , in my point of view , the youth enjoy lives more than their elders do .
