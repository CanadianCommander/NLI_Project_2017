pollution is a today burning issue .cars are the first point we think of when we talk about this issue .but , even if there are more and more friendly-environment policies which work or not , what about cars using ?will we use less our cars in twenty years than nowadays ?not having utopic opinions , we are allowed to answer this question yes , according to several elements about the changements which will occur about using cars .first , even if the lobbies which control petrol production are among the most powerful , the worlwide reserves of petrol are going decreasing .this is a well-kown fact , but as it is `` material  , nobody can prevent us from this .this is a non-renewable resource and we are using a great part of it .so our way to use this resource can not be endless ; the situation will change .moreover , we heard it from the news more and more , scientists are searching and finding alternatives to petrol working cars .although these solutions are often complicated and remains expensive , all the works about this topic are progressing .but , they are and will remain a certain time expensive alternatives for the consumer ; thus they appear as a factor which will probably reduce the using of cars in the coming years .given that it will be the only solution to use cars , the number of cars we use nowadays will certainly dercrease .third , to reduce our using of cars is the first mean we have to reduce pollution , one of the growing-importance issue of our modern societies .industrials pollution are being diminished by laws , but the next step is a control of using cars , as it is done actually in certain countries like france .it is the best way we have to fight against pollution and the changes about climates which begin to occur throughout the world .in fact , the other aspect of such a policy would be a very important developpement of the collective transports already existing as tubes , buses , etc . ..transporting more people than cars , they are an advantaging solution at several levels .as a conclusion , even if it still sounds utopic to say that it will have fewer cars in twenty years , several elements lead us to think this will come true .
