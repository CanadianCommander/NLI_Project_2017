inventing the wheel againthe method for being sucessful in life is not written on an ancient egyptian scroll .in today s world no one can really determine what will be a hit or not .inventing a new things is sure necessity to be sucessful , but one should not blindly take risks in the sake of it .one s experience is his best treasure and his best guide for reaching sucess .successful people improve on what they already do well .imagine someone who wants to be a good swimmer .he first learns freestyle and as soon as he learns it enough to look good , he starts learning butterfly , backstroke , breastroke and so on .while a competitor chooses his best stroke to be freestyle and puts just the same energy and time to freestyle only .the first swimmer can race and be good in all styles but when he races freestyle , the second swimmer will win .success in sports is similar to success in life for many things .if one does nt focus on one thing and learn it quite well he wo nt improve on it .successful people plant their strategies well and work on the things they already know to improve themselves .in order to be sucessful in a subject one should bring something new into that subject .in order to bring in something new to the table , one should first know what s been put on the table .successful people who has experience on their subjects already know not only what has been done upto that point , but also they understand what is needed next .someone looking at a picture from outside can not see the next step , can not see what that businness field is lacking and what would be a big gap filing invention .taking a risk on new things without and experience on it is like driving in dark with no headlights .being successful does not mean doing only what has been done up to that point without chaning it .successful people always re-invent and improve things in their fields .the first rule of being successful is not stopping and always improving on what one have .success stories are based on doing dramatic things .however it is only a fair luck to be successful in a field by just taking risks and trying new things .new things are necessary for improvement and success .but for new things , experience is a must .successful people are the ones that try new things in the light of their experiences .
