successful people try news thnhgs .it is not the bad idea .i think people should learn new thing every day .it is fun to learn new thnigs .and when you learning new things you can know what is things you good at and do better than another people .but if you already know how to well on one things .another people are know well to do anothert things .that you do nt need to woried about when you try to do another thing you will make mistake .because you can just toled the people is good at do for you and you can do the things you good at for him .for example today there is a complian .there are three people are going to make chairs .there is a who can cut the trees faster than everyone .b is who can use one tree two make two chairs .and c is who sells cahirs faster than everyone .so if today you are a boos what are you going to do ?to make each one to leant how to cut the tres like a , make chairs like b or sells chairs like c. but that will be westing to much time and money .and it problem will not make the good chairs .so i think if there is one person he is good at something already and you shoul keep him to do the same thing .and another peopl do what is they good at .if you do nt know waht is you good at you can try new things untial you find out waht is you good at .so successful people try new thingd and rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .this will be work .this waht happen in the world now and to becane more propucally .
