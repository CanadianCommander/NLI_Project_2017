`` give me ten young indians and i ll change the world  - swami vivekanandai strongly believe that young people are the backbone of any community and i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the first participation will always come from the youth be it any type of community work in all the extreme situations .i feel that youth play a major role in shaping of the community and its upliftment on the whole .i would like to present a glaring example for the same .recently our country witnessed the worst tragedy - tsunami which engulfed innumerable lives .the sea ravaged the entire coastal strip and people lost their life , families , food and shelter for none of their mistakes .i would like to highlight the participation of youth in rehabilitation works in the effected regions .india overcame such a crisis with in no time due to the young people who spent sleepless nights for the rehabilitation work .young people from all the software companies , ngos and student organisations thronged the entire area for rescue operations .i was also part of my college troop bits - tsumani who participated in the relief measures .not only this be it any crisis , first hand help is always given by the young people .in addition to the crisis management , young people also play a role in moulding their community .just to state a few , they take part in maintaining the cleanliness of the society , security considerations , creating public awareness , health camps and the list is never ending .some active youth organisations like nss , indulge in the rural development .they spread awareness in the rural areas and they serve a means for serving the poor and the needy .at last but not the least i can not forget the young men in the armed forces safeguardign our nation risking their own lives .my salutations to them always .in the broader sense their might be raising modernisation but the involvement of youth in helping the community can not be under rated .
