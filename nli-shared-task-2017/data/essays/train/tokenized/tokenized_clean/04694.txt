i do agree with the viewpoint that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are .in fact , the purpose of the advirtisement is to incite the desire of the customers and increase the sales of their products .it is unavoidable to use some kind of communation skills to stimulate customers to buy their products .in order to increase the sales of the products , advertisements will mask some kind of shortages of their products and only put emphasis on the outstanding points of the products .for example , the renovation of the processors of the personal computers is fast .many processors manufactures always emphasize on the processing speed of their products .however , they never mention some important features such as how much electricity will be used for using the chips and how hot they will produce during usage .for a good computer , low temperature and stable performence are far more important rather than fast speed , however , the advertisements never expose their shortages .another example is the advertisements for restaurants .they always show how good their foods are and how low cost for their foods .however , the advertisements seldom give correct information to costemors that what kind of food is good for health and necessary for human body .the purpose of the photos of the advertisement is to arise the interests of customers and the ultimate goal is to sell their products .in addition , when we buy foods in malls or supermarkets , we can often discover that the pictures do not match with the products .the photos of their products are surely more beautiful than they are in reality .good advertisements will deliver the correct information to the customers and help customers make reasonable decision .on the other hand , inadquate advertisements will affect the brand images of the products and further damage customers .in my opinion , more and more poor advertisements are showing throuth different media and thus it will be more difficult for customers to make right decision in the future .
