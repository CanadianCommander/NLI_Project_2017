i am agree with this statement .it s true that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .as advertisements are used to attract customers and to make the products more popular , the companies would nt lose this chanllege to show the best side of their products .sometimes , they also give an image which is not true of their products to customers .this is an image which customers desire but not an image which below to the products .we kow that most companies face to a great competition , there are son many comapnies produce the same product .so companies have to do much efforts in order to be more stronger .meanwhile , if there is one comopany have atoped some advertisements to make its products more attractif , it s not fair that others companies of the same sector do nothing .but should customers be victim of companies  competition and profits ?no , we are the customers , and we have the rights to know the truth .we want to buy the products which we want .we pay for what we desire , and we wo nt pay for lier .in some paticular sectors , like medicin , some people died because advertisement did nt give the truth .but there is nt a rule agains this action .so between moral and rule , we should have a correct choice .
