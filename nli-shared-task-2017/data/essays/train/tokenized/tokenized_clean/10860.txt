i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and there are three main reasons why i think so .first of all , there are more tasks given to young people than to old people .for example , young people have to study in order to go to school and get a good mark at class .they also have to work to make money or to be experienced enough to get a better job .sometimes they are too busy to do something they really want .but older people have done all the tasks given to them .all they have to do is to receive a reward and appreciation for their hard work and achievement .secondly , old people are wise enough to realize what pleases them .in other words , they enjoy their lives whereas young people often get stressed out from living .old people have more experiences and clues about what life and they know how to behave when they face a challenge .probably the reason why young people think they are struggling through their lives is that they have less experiences than older people and panic whenver they find their lives difficult .old people know how to enjoy their lives , hoping young people will soon realize what they figured out when they were young .thirdly , and more importantly maybe , old people are richier than young people .they have worked hard and have earned money as a result .they can spend money on whatever they want .they can buy a fancy car , they can make a beautiful garden , and they can even give their money to their children if they want to .everyone wants to enjoy life and the only difference is the ways of enjoying life .people can not assume that old people can not enjoy life only because they are old and boring .obviously , there are many things for young people to learn from older people .they need to learn how to work hard , how to achieve their goals , and how to enjoy life .however , most of these questions will be answered completely as they actually get aged .
