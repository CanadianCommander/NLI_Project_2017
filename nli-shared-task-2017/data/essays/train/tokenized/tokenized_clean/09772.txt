i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .at first question i mention about if i am reading statement : what is the definiton of a car in twenty years ?are we talking about cars like today ?with a gas enginge or are we talking about a vehicle with alternative enginges ?if so , for me this vehicles are not cars .they are another kind of transporation machine and can not be summarized under the topic cars .so , it might be possible to say there are less cars in twenty years , but only because of a statistic trick .another reason why i disagree with the statement is the fact , that most people in this world nowadays still have no car .of course the most people in the western world got are car but what about all the people in asia and africa ?only in one of this areas live more people then in the western world togehter , e.g. india .also the industrial revolution already started in those countries and it is only a matter of time when they will get the same life standard than the people in the western world .life standard in the western world means to be an owner of at least one car .today it is possible to see the statistic fact that one cititzien , e.g. in germany , often owns more then at least two cars .so if only the people in india at least will own only one car the statement false .the last reason why i disagree with the statement is that the industrie needs cars to move their goods between there production areas .therefore it does not matter if we are talking about a company that produce heavy products or just produce services .to connect the people with the products of the company it is necessary to use a car .the employee must be able to meet his customer and the customer needs the possibility to get to the company for e.g. to buy something or to ask for services .
