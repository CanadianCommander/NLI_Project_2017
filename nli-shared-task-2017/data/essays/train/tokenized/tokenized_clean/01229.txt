i totally agree with this statement .and i think a lot of examples can be found in everyday life .just look at the advertisements you can get in the normal supermarket , like food .in the advertisement everything seems very healthy , even the choclate nut cake with cream .the company of the product tells you how much vitamins or other healthy things their product contains .maybee , that there is a huge amount of a special vitamin found in the choclate nut cake , because of the nuts it cotains .but the advertisement does nt mention how many fat is in there because this of course would nt turn out to be a very healthy figure .in the past years the advertisement tried to capture probable buyers of their product with the signs `` zero fat  or `` zero sugar  .but honestly , who ever expected a lollipop for example to contain fat ?other non-eatable products like detergent or facial creams as well are not the magical liquids and fluids they pretend to be .many people let the advertisement lead their trolley in the supermarket .and when they are at home they discover the truth behind all the colorfull promises .one thing that shows , that even the politicians are aware of the dangers of the all to promising advertisement is the prohibition of tobacco advertisement on tv and in newspapers .the tobacco industry has a lot of money , so they can afford the best advertisement which promises the consumers freedom , coolness , cleverness and a lot of other things if only they lit a cigarette .the fact that wealthy companies can spend a lot of money on promising advertisement on the other hand means that that smaller companies that ca nt afford expensive advertisement ca nt promise too much to the cosumers .of course this does nt mean , that products with less promising advertisement necessarily are healthier products .but in my opinion it is more likely .
