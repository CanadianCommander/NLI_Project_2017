there are two kinds of people of working on the world .one kind of people is trying new thinkgs and the another kind of people is not trying new thing just only doing what they already been doing .most of people want to be successful people .but it is too hard to be that people .if you want to be successful people you d better try new things .there are three things that are help to understand to my opinion .first .the world is fast changing what we can not see its changing .for example , 20years ago , did we know about computer s technology such as e-mail , game , and fax .but what about now ?we usually use computer when we are working .if i did nt know computer s technolohy , we would spend much time than before .as you know , we should learn about how to use computer and try it .second , we know somebody who is already successful and they try new thinkgs .as you know , the presdent of ms ( micro soft ) who is the best bussiness man in the world and best rich .according to some researcher , he always try new things .if he did nt try think about pc ( persnol coputer ) , we would nt use pc now .another person is bush who is presdent of u.s .he try to make great conutry .he always think that how to be u.s stronger than now .most of american think he is a great presdent .third , somebody who is not trying new things can not improve anymore .of course , they are professional in their major .however .can they follow the changing of world ?they did nt know about that .they did nt get new ideas from experiense of new things .finally , new things can show me new idea .sometimes it will be able to give fail to us .but we should keep trying new things .do you want to be successful ?try it and get great ideas .
