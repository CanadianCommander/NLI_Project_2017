i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do for various reasons .first of all , many young people today are under so much pressure , that they often do not find time to just `` enjoy life  but have to study or work hard to compete with many others their age to get a satisfactory job or a place at a good university which they want to attend .elderly people , on the contrary , especially if they are already retired , are much more free to enjoy their time .as a psychological research has shown , people experience a shift in values during their lifetime .while younger people are still very much keen on achieving material richness and tend to compare themselves much more with others , older people seem to put more emphasis on emotionally closely-knitt relationships and value material goods less than young persons do .hence , one could assume that elderly people do nt experience as much social pressure from society than youngsters .the high rate of suicides among young people would also speak against the assumption , that young people in general enjoy life more than older people do .however , i also do not believe that older people generally have a more joyous life than the younger generation .they face different challenges : while young people might experience greater mental stress , older people most probably have to conquer more physical stress , often in the form of serious diseases .as an open question in the end i would like to ask whether it is at all possible to determine the level of a person s enjoyment from an outside perspective ! ?
