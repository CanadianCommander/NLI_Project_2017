the pace of the development in science and technology is hard to compare with any of the previous periods .we witness a post-industrial revolution , or in other words we are transforming into a knowledge-society .with this great transformation , academic world is also reshaping its way of doing research .the number of the research areas are increasing and interactions among disciplines become more frequent .in this context , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will contribute much more to our scientific knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject .specialization in one specific area is sometimes good for instance , in discovering a new medicine .but , there may be waiting a number of opportunities with a broad knowledge of academic subject .therefore , in scientific research there is an incresing tendency to make inter-disciplinery studies .for example , economics and physics are rather different two subjects .but , scientists from these fields are arranging joint-congresses in order to find solutions to the problems of theis fields .biologist and sociologists are collaborating to understand the nature of the behaviors of animals living together like ants .this kind of inter-disciplinery approach can open new doors for some critical inventions .using nano-technology for some vital heart problems saves a lot of peoples life or at least increase the quality of their life .finally , in a very rapidly developing enviroment of sciences , inter-disciplinery studuies will bring a lot of suprises to our lives .so , it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subjects and education systems much revised with this approach .
