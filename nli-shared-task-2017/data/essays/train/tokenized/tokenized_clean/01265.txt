as i learnt from my own experiences , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .students are not able to face with the facts and it is easier for them to try to understand ideas and concepts .the first point i would like to make is that there some instinct feelings which make students tend to pay more attention to understanding ideas and concepts .this is related to students age .most of students who are below 23 have trouble with their feelings .the people under this age are tend to choose the easiest ways in order to satisfacte themselves .the feelings control students .not only this feelings determines students preferences , but also the places they grew up play a crucial role in choosing preferences .for example a person who study at high school is adjusting his behaviour according to what he or she sees from his friends .over all , in my opinion people who study at education centers such as schools , private courses , preperation classes etc . ..look like more interseting in realizing ideas and concepts .this is a burning issue and may be fully cleared in the future .
