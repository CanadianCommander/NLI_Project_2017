i agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather only doing what they already know how to do well .there are many reasons for this , some of which i would like to present in this presentation .the success in one s life make people to explore many things .they get intrested as they succeed in the things they do and try to take risk rather than fixing to the things they have done before .they some times try to see the same things in the different perspect so that they can do even better .the statement `` successful people try new things  can be even much explained with an example .let s take thomas alva edison , the great scientist who had many inventions to his name .edison had more than 1000 inventions to his name which proves that successful people try new things .let us consider the invention of the bulb .if edison had convinced with that invention and try to do the same things repeatedly would not have fetched him anything .he being a successful person tried the new things and took the risk involved in it .eventually , he succeeded in everthing .he kept on inventing many new things which were very useful to the people .this shows how the successful people try different things .in my view , successful people should try new things which would help him to gain not only knowledge but also increases the creativity , seeing things in different attitude .trying new things even helps one to learn more from his mistakes which would be very helpful in his further things .successful people influences the surroundings in which they are , helping the other people to succeed in their part .in sum , the success which the people get makes them to try for many more new things rather than sticking to the things they already know .
