more and more young people today are often considered as the kind of people who always think about themselves not someone else .they always think they are busy doing some very important things , so they do nt need to think about spending their free time to helping their communities , even though many experts inspire young people to do so and mention many times about that they can learn many things from the activity .so according to the writing question , my answer is that i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .i have two reasons to support my idea .firstly , young people today are too selfish to consider other people s feeling and see other people s needs .it is just like what i mentioned before .they always think they are so special people in their mind that they may think other people need to give them some services for sure .to cuase the result may be that most parents today spoil or treat their children too much well , and forget to remind them the old saying : giving is better than taking .so it is esay to understand why young people do nt want to spend enough time for their community .the another reason is that our educational system too much emphasize that if students have a good grade in studying and then they will have more opportunities to have a successful future that is waiting for them .so now young students have a `` good  excuse to decline the activity about spending time to help their community .in fact , it is not a good situation for young people s growth , so governments and parents need to think about the issue more serious .
