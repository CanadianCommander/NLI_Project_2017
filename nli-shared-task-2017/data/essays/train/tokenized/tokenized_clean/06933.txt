in olden days we use to hear people saying `` jack of all and master of none  .well , it means that the particular person is skilled enough to perform many tasks but not in depth .these people can find jobs , works in many different places earlier but not today .yes , today we belong to the world of specialization .by specialization we mean that the person is not master of all but jack of one thing in particular .these principles apply to our daily schedules , programmes and studies even .like around us we can observe the height of miniaturization being achieved by companies , scientists etc .these can only be achieved if the person has a thorough knowledge about a particular subject , regarding its principles , designs oriented its pros and cons and many other things .as a result it takes people to study further go for masters , we can see people pursuing their ph .d s in a particular topic which an undergraduate student would have read under a chapter .so knowledge in depth about the particular topic or a subject can result in many interesting conclusions and its amazing results can benefit people later on .though it requires a lot of hardwork to have knowledge in depth but on the other hand it can help the world with new discoveries and inventions .but along with the specialization one needs to take care regarding the fattigue which results to an individual practising the same instrument for many years .as a result along with specialization person should involve in various other activities too so that his interest in a particular application is maintained .since its the world of specialization so we need to be specialized in a particular task and help this world with its demanding needs .and along with it we need to take care of our interests , refresh ourselves well within time and work more enthusiastically in future .
