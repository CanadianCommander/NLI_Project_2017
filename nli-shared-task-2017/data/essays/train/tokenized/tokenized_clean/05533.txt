i do believe that the young people nowadays give enough time to help their communities .i am making this statement based on severel experiences which i have described below .recently there was a proposal for reservation of seats in leading educational institutions for few sections of the community in india .lots of young people opposed to this law .there were protests in several cities against this law .i also took part in a protest in the city i lived .we protested by carryout a peaceful rally in the city .in all these protests it was observed that the majority of the protesters were young people in the age group of 20 to 25 .it is intersting to note that these young people donot gain anything from this protest but they knew that the law would kill the merit and affect the next generation of students .this was their was of helping the community and they were successful at it .another instance in which i was involved and where i felt that the young people were doing their part to help their communities is described below .about a year back i was involved with a voluntary organisation which worked towards the upliftment of poor construction worker kids .we had planned to organise a party for these poor kids and we needed volunteers to organise some games and sports for the kids and also raise some money for the event .we made a call for the volunteers and its was great to see that lots of young people turned up .the volunteers not only helped in organising the event but also raised money for the event by donating from their pockets .the event was a great success .also i see lots of young people involved in creating aids awareness india .i do agree that in this age of fast life , people find it difficult to take some time out of their busy schedule to contribute to the society .but i do feel that all the young people are doing thier part by spending money or effort to help their comminities .
