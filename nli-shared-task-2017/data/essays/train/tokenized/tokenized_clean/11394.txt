in my view young people enjoy life more but moreover in an other way .three arguments are on my mind why i am able to sign this statement .in the first place young people do have much more free time .while young people are normally finished around 5ish with school , adults have to work longer .furthermore young poeple have more holidays and are free on the weekends .my father has his own enterprise .normally he returns home for dinner .but while he is still working , i watch tv or i play tennis with my brother .i guess sometimes he could use more free time so that he would be able to do such activities and just enjoy .that brings me to my next thought .older people have more responsabilities than younger people .according to that , adults need to invest more time into complex things such as taxes or bills .my fathers company counts 300 workers .he is responsible for everyone .if you have to keep up with such a big responsability , your day can be stressy .young people do not have to worry about that because they count on the help oh their parents .finally young people have more energy to do activities .it is natural that a young body is fitter than an older one .the bones are still young and the body of a young person is still growing .when my mother an me go for a walk up the hill she is the first to make a break .my legs are younger and i am able to wlak longer distances because of my condition .in conclusion there are several reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do .the most important is that young people have more free time .in spite of that older people enjoy life too , but in an other way .
