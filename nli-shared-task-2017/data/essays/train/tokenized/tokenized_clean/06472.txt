in my opinon travelling with a tour guide is good then going alone the three reasons why i prefer the tour guide are more information about the places , can see new more places and safety .in first by travelling with a tour guide we can t get more information about the places .recently i vistied a place for the first time .i hired a tour guide by which i got more information about the places and monuments which i had seen during the visit .he had told about the history , specifications , etc .he also helps us by translating the local language which we cant understand .so hiring give us more information about the places .in second we can see new more places because he would have the details about the places like how much time it would take , about the accomidation , etc .because his agents , by which they can hire room very easily .they would not be any loss of time for going and waiting for a mean of transportation .we will enjoy a lot , which we can not do with out a tour guide .the last one is abouth the safety because when we visit a new place we dose nt know about the crime rate .by hiring a tour guide he would be taking us to the places which are safety .he also helps us by contacting with the local people when we are in trouble .when we are affected with a fever or some sort of health problem he will be knowing the best doctor in that town .visting a place means a happy thing , so hiring will helps us to have safety tripin conclusion touring a new place with a tour guide gives us more information about the place , we can see new more places and safety .i recoomend to travel with a tour guide when you visit a new place .
