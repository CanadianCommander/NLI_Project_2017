the travelling is now very common in our scocities .people generally alway want to go either the new place or the place which they have gone before because they want to know in detailed about that place .some people want to go alone or some prefer to group .however , i perssonally prefer that when i go in group , it must be led by the tour guide .because tour guide have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in intresting way and also wasy to follw the group .the travelling in group is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person which explain about the place in detail i ; e tour guide .when we go to the new place , we have superficial information about the landmarks , musium etc .however the tour guide ihave detailed infomation about like detailed history , importance and significance about that place .the travelling is worthwhile if we will get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money .secondly , tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups .they make some funny statements , spme jokes .even sometimes , the information is real but they convey in a group such a way that everybody laughs .for examle , i went to visit a monumant i.e tajmahal in india .this tajmahal is built by the sahjaha in love of the wife .everytime our tour guide asked to us that what will your husband will make for you in future .he laso commented on man that you eill not build this kind of monument thet means you donot like your wife .this is historical truth but the way , tour guide were expressed make travelling intresting .in addition , if the gruop is led by tour guide , the more organised and have proper schedule .it is very convenient to follew the each and every person of the group and also timely fashoned .if i spend a lot of meny and time , i want to know everything about that place .my travel should have fun and well organised .therefore , i totally agree that going in group led by the tour guide is best way to travel .
