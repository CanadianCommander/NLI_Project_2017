i do not agree most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .first , tv , newpaper , internet and so on , more and more come into our life , so we can get a lot of advertisments everyday .in the day life , we have to buy lots things , the same thing we have so many chance , which one is better for use , which one price is better , we can not look for every store , so the advertisments give us the information .oh , this one is good , has a lot of function , we shall buy this one `` we will say that after saw the advertisement .but , if the real products is not better as advertisment , we spend time and monay , then we buy the product is not we want , what will happend next ?we do not trust advertisements anymore .second , sometime , we really need the product , it is most importent to us , we bought the one after study a lot of advertisments , but you got the one was not you wanted .if you bought it at store , you can change or return it at once , but you bought it via internet , what you can do ?it is mean you lost a chance .third , that publisher or producter give people advertisements are not real products .people are not trust you again , you will lose the market .so i do not agree that piont .
