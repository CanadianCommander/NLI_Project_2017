today we can see on television many kinds of advertisements .these kinds can attract our attention or not .many times television s advertisements attract my attention about some products that really are not interesting for me .but the scatch and the music are made so carefully that i ca nt refuse to watch them .these advertisements attract so much my attention that i want immediately to buy that product also if it does nt is usefull for me really .only after i understand that the product is not how i imagined it watching it on television , but it s really different .for example when i saw a really beautiful advertisement of a watch on tv , i immediately went to buy it .but when i took it in my hands , it looked really different from the watch i saw on television and i was not so happy to have bought it as i thought .so i understood that what i liked was not the object watched on tv , but his advertisement .some other advertisements are not so good and often , when they pass on television , i do nt watch them very well .but often these advertisements present an object that is much better than the one well presented on tv .for example i never paid attention to a particular pair of jeans that often i watch on tv ; the advertisement was not really good and so it never took my attention .but when i went to buy a pair of jeans , after i tried many pairs of them , i bought the pair of jeans i saw on television that never paid my attention .it was really confortable and i liked it .so i agree with this statement because many times what seems to be good on television is not really so , while what on tv seems not so interesting perhaps it can be good and can likes me when i see it in my hands .
