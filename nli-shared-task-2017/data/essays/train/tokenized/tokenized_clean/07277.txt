i disagree with the statement that nowadays young people do not spend an appropriate amount of their time to helping their communities .the first reason why i disagree with the statement is that the world we live in chnges fairly quickly .as a result of that , a sound education is the most important point that younger people must follow .education is a very time-consuming issue .therefore , the time young people have to spend for helping their communities is generally limited .furthermore , i do not believe that spending time for their communities is a special task for the younger people .there may be some objective evidence that the willingness of people to help their communities became smaller .however , i strongly believe that this is a dilemma of the society we live in .it is no choice to argue that the younger ones must use more of their time for helping their communities .finally , i do not believe that the amount of time which is used by younger people for helping their communities has significantely changed from the past .i assume that it might be a problem of visibility .if , for example , younger people organise computer lessons for children or guide children in the internet , it might look like some kind of game to some observers .however , teaching children the correct use of new media is a very valuable helping for communities .as a result , i believe that younger people do not need to use more
