i do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .they seem that they have a lot of things to do for their own benefits or interests , however , there are more things to be reported to let communities know about .i would like to talk about one teenager who i knew from newspaper printed here , melbourne , in australia .recently , there are many tragic car accidents on melbourne roads .fouty - one people are killed in three months , the government agues that the low need to be more strict so that less people would be killed .however , among the community , there was a doubt about the government s opinion .is it the law that can reduce the number of death ?while the government does nothing about , another car accident happened on a same road where two people are killed a month ago .we are appalled and shocked by ever-increaseing care accidents .but this time , tragedy happened with respectable event .there was a big item whose headline was ` our hero  .a fourteen year old boy who lives close to the road where accident has happened , accidentaly saw the car accident and he run across the road to help two people in a crashed car .there were a woman and a baby .he helped the baby farst and confirmed that he is allright .then the boy attempted to help the woman but she was hardly injured that she could not talk properly .to prevent her from beind in unconsiousness and dying , he kept talking with her .he asked a lot of questions and told her the baby is fine .he has been talking with her for about thirty minutes , however , despite his effort she passed away .after all , he went to her funeral with flowers .he knew that the woman was the baby s mother .he told her ` your baby is ok.  and he was thanked by the baby s father .the baby s father told him your my hero .but he said , ` i do not want be treated as a hero .i just saw the accident and acted what i could do .he has a blessret which is printed the word ` change the world  .from the newspaper that i read few days ago , this boy has done what other teenagers would have done .therefore , i disagree the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
