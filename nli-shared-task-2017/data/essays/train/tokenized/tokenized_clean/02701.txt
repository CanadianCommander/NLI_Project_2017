i can not really agree with the statement .in my oppinion it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have a knowledge of many academic subjects .i think in todays world companies want people to know everything about the area they work in .what should a company do with someone how knows from everything a bit but does not really have fundamental knowledge about a certain area .that is also a reason why i decided to study a specialiced subject .i for examble study international finance which is a small part of the big economical area .i think for myself that this decicon the best was i ever did .because their are so many people who study economics i mean good they may have a broad knowledge about all areas but at the end they would not be able to understand the financial sector as good as i can .as far i know companys are looking specially for people from the financial sector which are specialized in that field .which advantages and disadvantages would it have ?on the on side with a broad knowledge you might be more flexible .because those people could work in all economical areas they want .on the other side i am not sure if a broad knowledge is enough to fullfil your aims and make the big money .you can work in all economical areas but to became at top manager you should know about the fiel you are about to manage .that is a advantage me with only a specialized knowledge .i would know about the area i am about to manage and would know how to handle the problems which might occur .a disadvantage really is that i am really stucked onto the financial sector .if i want work i am not that flexible like i would be with a broad knowledge .but if i add up all those disadvantage and advantage it is still good for me to be only specialized in one subject .i may only have this oppinion because i am very interested in that area i am study .but figures do not lie companys at the end prefer specialised employees .
