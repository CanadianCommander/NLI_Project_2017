life is nice .it is our responsibilty to enjoy it .life ; however , has many aspects that could prevent us form enjoying it , there are diferent setuations met in life depending on a persons age .such difernses will affect the enjoment .some people think toung people enjoy life more than older people .but i think that the elderly ` have much more enjoyment of life than youngsters .major reasons for that are finantial presure , difrent phses of dvolpment they met , and the butiful memories the have .young people tend to have a lot of pesure .an employed person wants not only to keep his job but to get a promotion so hat he or she have better finantial situation .there is always the threat if beeing fired and loosing the funds he or she can run his or her life with .a unemployed person will always be under pressure of finding a job .the elderly are usualy retired and get their retirmant benfets reglarly .those who never had retiment benfets can easly get acsses to government programes like socal security .sons and doters also tend to help their parents .these factors help the elderly to feel relaxed , and by dooing so , they enjoy life .another important point is that the older ganretion experianced life in diffrent devolpent phases .for example , the elderly in saudi arbia witnessed the inrtoduction of electircty , the first radio brodcast in the reagon , devolpment in trasportation , and the introduction of internet .this would help them thank the allmighty for the grace they are living in and apreceat it , while younsters may curese the low speed internet .a wise man once said `` memories are anothor life  .this means that any person will enjoy his memories .not only does the elder comunity have more time to remember , but also they have much more memories .alot of memories with enogh time to remember will increase the posibilty of enjoyment .this will continue to be a debative esue .it may be true that generlisation will not give the corct answer , but it will help us to understand tha causes of enjoyment and aply then in our life .if we uderstood why the elder comunity enjoyed life , our life would be much happier .
