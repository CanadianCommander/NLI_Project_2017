i totally agree with this statement .indeed it is clear advertisers want to give a good image of their products and in advertisements the product seems better then in reality .in my opinion it is not amazing because the goals of the adverts is to sell .that is why customers can only see the best aspect of the product .advertisers have to imagine a way to lure people .if it is a good advert , people will have lust to buy the product even if they are not very well informed .i think if products seem better it is because there is a lack of information for the consumer .besides it is not the aim of the advert to inform customers and sometimes advertisers overstep the bounds of the product by showing some irreal situation .i mean sometimes the product is not the core of the advert but the goal is to show it and that people regognize it in shops .for example a famous advert for a shampoing conveys the idea that the product is pretty erotic . ..it is a weird way to use this product but if you are naive you can think it is true and you will be disappointed .thus products are more attractive if they are not ordinary and when people see the advert on tv it is always with handsome men or pretty girls . ..in order to sell dreams .as a result the product seems always better when it is on tv .for instance a woman can see a beautiful skirt on a top model but when she will see it in a shop she will be disappointed .owing to the goal of the advert , the product is shown as something beautiful and even if it is an usual product , like soap or milk , many people will buy this one because they have seen it on tv although the product is not more different than another one .to conclude i really agree witj this statement because i think advertisements sell dreams and it is not often the reality , that is why products seem much better then they really are .
