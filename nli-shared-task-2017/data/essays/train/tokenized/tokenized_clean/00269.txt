i absolutely agree with the statement that , successful people try new thinghs and take risks .i think that the most important characteristic of a successful person is the want to better oneself , and this is made by the want to learn new things .the best way to learn new things is working whit other people .of these two kinds of working , either working alone or working whit other people , i prefer working in groups for the reason that i ve just mentioned above .working whit other people gives us competition , and i think it s very important to increase our knowledge .on the other hand , when i work alone , i can decide when start and finish my work .i have more freedom than when i work in groups , but ther is much work to do .i also think that , the word success means risk !in fact , if you do the same things all day , nothing will be change !in conclusion , the best way to try new things is to increase one s knowledge , so , working whit other people even if you do nt like them .-
