we do nt know why some people can success easily than others ?many people may think because they are lucky or they have always had some people to help them .however , in my opinion , i do agree that successful people try new thing and take risks raher than only doing waht they already know how to do well .because they are more creative and they know how to integrat their knowledge than others .first of all , creative people have more chances to be successed .if a person has a new useful idea to change old stuff , the person could have more chances to be successful .for ecxample , one of my friends , he has always had new ideas to open his new business and he can find out the new business that other people ca nt see .even thought , there are many rsiks but he is willing to face this challenge and to get over it .what i mean is that if a person has a creative personality and understand where the rsiks are .this way a person will have more chances to be successful .therefore , i would say creative and aware of risks will provide people more chances to be successful .secondly , the ability to integrat our knowledge can help us success .in the case of my friend , he has studied in bussiness school .during the school time , he studied many different subjects such as accounting , fincial management or case study .base on these skills , he knew how to combine his knowledge in order to find out the risks and creat new business .hence , i would say the ability to integrat our knowledge is a basic skill to be successed .to sum up , many people wonder how can they be successful ?the problem is that we do nt integrat and use our knowledge , be more creative and be aware of the rsiks .however , in my believe , i would say these are important characteristics to be successful .
