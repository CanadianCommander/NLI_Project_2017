i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are a few reasons that can support my opinion .first , most people are having lack of time on excessive studying .the second problem is mass media s too much attention toward people s private lives .i agree with the statement , because of their lack of time , and the bad effects from the mass media .as the first , people do not give enough time to helping their communities because of the lack of time .most young people are really busy nowadays .young people who are under nineteen are studying really hard to go good college .so , they can not think anything but studying .the people who graduated college also have difficulies to participate on helping their communities .althought they are free from the college , their studying is not finished .they have to work hard to get a good job , such as lawyer , or work in the big company .because of their lack of time , they can not paticipate on helping their communities .in addition , the mass media , such as television shows or radio suffer young people to think about nothing , but just themselves .nowadays , most television shows are based on people s private life , that contains a famous movie star s personal lives or private things .through this process , young people who watch televison the most , are attracted to think about their personal and secret lives than the commununities .there are a few main problems that made young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communitie , .their lack of time because of studying , and the mass media s too much attention toward people s personal lives .if these problems can be solved , young people will spend more time on helping their communities .
