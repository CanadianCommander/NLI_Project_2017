nowadays , old people blame young people of not helping their communities for enough time .they accuse young people of being more personal than being a part of the community .if you just look at time spent on community , they seem to be right .on the contrary , if you examine the conditions , they are not .today , it is very hard for a young person , to have spare time .because working hours and conditions are worse than older times .they have to work hard to have a job .if you are not a devoted worker , it is possible to lose yoru job .in addition , finding another job is much harder today .a young person who may have the opportunity to help his community is probably a well-educated , economically secure .nowadays , people in same conditions as menioned above are numerous .this gives the opportunity to the employer that if he/she fires someone because of not staying overtime , he/she will find a new employee in short time .in the past , qualified workers were rare , because of war and epidemics .also , it does not make any difference , even if you spend much of your time in helping communities , your efforts are negligible compared to the need .communities are getting larger and more people need these time and money .older people look at the number of people who needs help and they claims that young people do not help them .i tink this is not fair .government and local authorities should help communities , not individuals .today big money is required for fulfilling these needs .older people may make larger donations and professionals may do the job accurately and effectively .so , it is not fair to say that young people do not use their spare time in helping their communities .it is the conditions that prevents them from it .young people do not have enough time or money .older people should get involved in the subject and help their communities .if they are unable , than government and local authorities should do the job .please , do not make young peoples life harder .
