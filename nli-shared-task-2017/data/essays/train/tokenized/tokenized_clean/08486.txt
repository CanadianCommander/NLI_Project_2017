i agree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .as much as time goes by , older people got more experience from the lives and they already have some fierce .so many older people do nt want to try new things such as education , travelling , and culture , etc .but the young people are different .they are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new things .i usually get happiness from learning .as my opinion , i think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have less chance to learn rather than young people .as time goes by , the number of entertainment increases .in the past , people should work for living but now people make money for the entertainment and qualities of thier lives .young people have more opportunity to enjoy their lives than older people do .for example , my father is very hard-worker and he does nt have free time for himself .sometimes , he looks like working robot .i want him not to work too hard and do whatever he likes but working becomes his routine life .my father has worked hard for the living and he ca nt stop working even though he is enough rich .i think my father is similar with any older people .goal of the lives is different between young people and older people .so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .i ca nt say which generation is happier than other generation because everyone has different conceptions of happiness .it does nt matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own lives .people should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve the happiness .
