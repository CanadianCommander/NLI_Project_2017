the number of cars in use have been dramatically increasing during last three decades .although only very wealthy families used to own a car in early 1900s , now nearly every family owns a car and even more than one car .but i think , this is the peak number for the cars in use .i strongly believe there will be fewer cars in use in the future .i have several reasons for this idea but the most effective 2 reasons are ; people s awareness of air pollution and chaotic traffic .let s have a look how people s awareness of air pollution will decrease the number of cars in use .people did nt know much about air pollution and its effects on our world in the past .however , now we are well aware what can air pollution cause as we are witnesses of its results .many people are getting sick more often , the hole in the atmosphere is getting greater , there are acid rains that destroy the nature very badly .these are the only a few results that we have seen .this led people to become more considerate about the environment .for example , many enviromentalist people do not use cars for transportation .they prefer public transportation or use their bike to get to the work as they are aware of bad affects of air pollution .what is more , problems about air pollution is told in many schools .as people will get more sophisticated about air pollution , fewer cars will be in use in future .the other reason why i think the number of cars in use will decrease is that many people are complaining about traffic .traffic has become one of the biggest problems of daily life .you can see many people travelling by buses although they have cars .since this is becoming a bigger problem day by day , more people will prefer using trains or their bikes for transportation .finally , i would like to say that great number of cars in use lead to many problems and as people are aware of these problems , the number of cars in use will decrease .air pollution and traffic that i have mentioned are only two bad results .to make your life and other people  s lives better , prefer other transportation ways ehenever you can .
