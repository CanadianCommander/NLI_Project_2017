when i was a litle boy , i always thought about `` why does uncle can look sad ?.it was the times that i tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find why we happened to be alive .uncle can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind .i tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic - like i said , i was a little boy then - , which i solved lots of times .however it did not matter how many times that i have solved his problems .it just made him to create more .then i understood that it is not just the `` things in his mind  , but there is something more which is socially structed by human beings and our culture .as time goes by , we grew up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society , which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people .when we are talking about society , we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structed situtations .in this example that i will give , one may see things more clearly .when i was at elemantary school , i just had to pass my courses , then i attended to the highschool , now i had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university .now i am studying at bogazici university which is really famous in turkey .however my missions continues to increase and advance while i am succeding and going on .this may seem a story of one .however that is not the truth .the truth is as a human being grew up , he/she will have more responsibilities which makes us more stressed than yesterday .why do you think old people loves to look at old pictures ?it is obvious that he/she wants to be like in the old days , the olds days that he/she had not any responsibilities .it may be seemed like only constructed society is to be blamed .however that constructor is us .human beings create society and society creates human beings .we can not really seperate them .human beings are well known as progresive and ambitious and that is why we are always trying to better and more powerful , that makes us stressed and unable to enjoy life day and day .to sum up , as time passes we will become sad and old .because that is what we created by wanting more and more .in this post-modern world , we are stucked in our created destiny , which is as we get older we will enjoy life less than younger people .
