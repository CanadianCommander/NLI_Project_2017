about this topic , either options have disadvantages and advantages .if i choose one side , i will choose learning broad knowledge about many subjects .there are three supporting ideas about my choice .the first reason is broad knowledge about subjects helps people to have enlarged work choices .if i know knowledge about science , marketing , and bussiness .when i invented good products , i will start bussiness and marketing by myself .i can be an owner of company , scientist etc .these broad knowledge helps me to get more choices of job than when i just know about science .furthermore , it will bring more financial profits and better reputation .the second idea is extent knowledge substitutes people s work when if people fail their main subjects or works .let s say i just know about painting industory .when the other substance , which will use instead of paints , is invented , i ca nt get any job because my major knowlegde becomes useless .however , if i knew many knowledge about many subjects , i can work at the other areas .therefore , learning broad information about subject is better than just learning one subject .the last reason is it helps people to stand out at many places .if i just know about science , i can show off when people talked about science , however , except science , i ca nt show off my ability because there are none left about the other subjects .however , if i know many parts of subjects , i can show off my knowledge everywhere and everytime .it helps me to live more confidential , moreover , i can self-satisfy .because of these three reasons , learning just one subject is not as good as learning broad knowledge about many subjects .therefore , i think that if people already learn about just one subject , i wish they got an attitude to pay attention to other subjects also .
