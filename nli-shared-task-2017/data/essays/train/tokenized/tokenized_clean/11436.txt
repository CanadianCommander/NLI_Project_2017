the fist cars start circulate during the first worl war , but this cars were just for rich people .after the second warld war , people feel better and had the possibility to had a job and improve their standard of life .cars factory understand that the car will be the symbol of wellness of the maa society , and start to project cheap and smart cars that a normal familt could bought .since this years , cars develope in their structure , in design , in confort , and the in number !today a family composed by four people has two cars , one for each parents .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for dirrerent reasons .for example , when one of the sons can drive a car , usually use one of his parents s car , but sometimes boys that can buy a car just for themselves .this is a big problem for the health of the world .today we can see the big metropolis in the world .there is too much traffic of cars !in this enormous cities people ca nt walk in the street , there is too much smog in the air and they ca nt breathe .traffic is also very noisy , this is the main cause of acustic pollution .our cities are growing up very queekly and the situation that we can see today in the big cities will be also in the small cities and in the country .car factory try to design new motors and new cars to control the air and the acustic pollutions that cars caused , but if the number of the cars will grow up , this not solve the problem .i think that every people in the world have to be something about this and can do something to stop this diredtion .i have the possibility to buy a new car but i will use my mother s car until i will need my own cars .every one can use public transport and governement have to do something to increment people to use it
