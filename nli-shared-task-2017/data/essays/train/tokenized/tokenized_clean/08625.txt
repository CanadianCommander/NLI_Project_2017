there are several things that makes our life easier such as computers , planes , cars and cellphones .there is a statement about cars : `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i can not agree with this idea at all .first of all i do not believe that there is going to be an invention that would take cars  place .the cars are the easiest way of transportation in daily life .as long as someone do not invent a machine that can fly between short distances and is cheaper than a car i will not sell my car !addition to that we use cars for public transportation too .i would nt be able to go somewhere i do not know if there were no taxis .what is more twenty years is too short to make an invention that can beat cars .although i really wish the number of cars to decrease in twenty years .cars are good for transportation but what about the environment ?they cause air pollution and the gas poisons people .every passing day the situation is getting worse .people die from lung cancer .there is also a big problem called ` traffic jam  .i think all of the big cities suffer from traffic jam at the rush hour .this cause city people to be more stressed and depressed , than the country people .the cars have a lot of advantages but i think disadvantages are more .i use my car not because it is fun , because it is a necessity .unfortunately i can not agree with the idea that says `` the number of cars will decrease in twenty years ..by thinking of the sentence `` necessity is the mother of invention  i hope there will be a better way of transportation in the future but i do not think there will be an important invention in twenty years .therefore i do not believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
