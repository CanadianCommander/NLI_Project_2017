main purpose of advertisement is that sold many products as many as they can and increase the reputation of products .advertisement goal is attract people s eyes .many people , who see the advertisement , think that this car is looks really great and that food is looks really good etc .but most of times , really product s quality is less than your expectations .most of the advertisement have too much extravagant .when i was middle school in korea during summer , i saw the advertisement of food in tv home shopping .it looks really great , and cheap .i thought it was good deal .i bought it .but it was horrible .i ca nt even eat at all .finally , i called service center and asked refund , but they did nt let refund .i felt cheat from them .after that time , i never something to buy in the tv home shopping .my father is advertiser of many things .he told me many things about main tecniques of advertisement .most advertiser cheat thier client who see the advertisement and buy it .i asked why advertisement have to make product extravagant information than they really are .my father said , they have to make product seem much better than they really are because most of advertisement doing that and advertisement have to attract thier consumer s eys .i think reason for fake advertisement is came from compete .advertiser tried to sold product as many as they can than other product and company .this compete damage only consumers .i think government should control the advertisement give to right and clear information to their consumers , instead the cheat and fake information to their consumers .
