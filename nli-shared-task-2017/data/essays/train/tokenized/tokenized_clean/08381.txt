first of all i want to say , what the question deals with .i am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject .there are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides .on my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledge of many subjects .the reason why this is on my opinion will be written down in the following text .first i want to say , that if you have a broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies .so it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic .maybe the company you want to be hired is searching for a person who knows things of every part of a firm .a reason can be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone .then they can hire you for a work but if a person of another work is missed , you are able to do his work too .furthermore i have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than specializing in one part .you should know everything about this part .i want to give an example .if you want to specalize in marketing , you have to know everything about it .you can only be hired in this part of a firm .and if you are not be needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked .but if you have the knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm .a third advantage of a broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things .you can learn new things in all parts of academic .it would be boring if you do the same things the whole of your life .a broad knowledge gives yiu the possibility that you can change yor work .your life would be more exiting .to finish the text i want to give reasons why this is on my opinion .i am studying buisness .but i am studying in all parts of buisness .so i can look with part will be good for me .maybe i will specialize my knowledge later but i know many things of other academic parts too .so i will be more flexible than other workers later .
