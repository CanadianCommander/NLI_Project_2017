in my opinion an individual should posses sufficient knowledge about his key academic subejcts along with possesing excellent skills in his choice of specific subject .in this competitive world , one is supposed to have an all rounder personality with a specialization or in other words mastery over that specific subject .from my experience , an all rounder person will be able to achieve greater success socially and professionally as he s sound in all of the related areas of his study but at the same time has sufficient knowledge so as not to fall back on any discussion other than his specialization .to start discussing about my opinion , lets take the situation when one choses to study all of his key subjects without mastering anyone of those .this practice will result him being vulnerable to loose to each opponent who has at least one of these subjects as his specialization , not ignoring the increased possibility that the individual will be able to participate in any event or conversation pertaining to any of his subject areas .another situation to consider will be , when one masters only specific subject without giving considerate attention to his other subjects , will lead him to a situation where he ll excel in his subject area conversations but at the same time , he ll not be in a situation to participate in a conversation about any other topic which is not his subject .in this situation the individual has greater chances of successding in his area of specialization .we can clearly see that the number of benefits an individual can gain by following either of the two statements will lead to number of disadvantages as well .as both of the statements has it s own set of pros and cons , i would disagree with any of these two statements taken alone .however , combining both of the statements would lead to a much more sensible and pragmatic way of advancing in competitive world .
