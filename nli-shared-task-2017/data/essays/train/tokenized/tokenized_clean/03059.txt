wherever you are , you will always have an ad , pointing out at an amaizing product , even if it looks weird or expensive .it will always show the good points of it , and if not , there is a chance that something did not go well !we are totally living in a consuming society , this one reason you have that much ads on tv , magasines . ..i remember when i was about 7 years old , i saw on tv an ad for the baywatch barbie and all it goes with .i totally felt for it .santa clause brought me the barbie and the jetski which match with for chrismas .i was so exciting that i started to play with it immediatly , but they were that tiny detail nobody took care about , the jetski was not water resistant and when i dived in my bath with it i was pretty disapointed !who could have guessed that ajetski would not be water resistant ?from my personnal experience i know that things always look better on and ad .however , two years ago i went with some mates to miami , and as we were laying down , watching tv , acting like real teenagers , this commercial pops : three ballerinas eating oreo s cookies , they were so cute who would not fell for them ?i might not have fell for her but i totally went for the cookies , they are so good !love them .i think the perception you got from an ad is so different from each others that it makes it difficult to have a real statement toward it .things could look good and are totally not and thing can look so weird and funny that you would not go for a bite , and it turns out that it is okay .honnestly , green jelly , no way .i remember in ireland , the ad with that kid who were eating like tons of it . ..more discusting than anything .green shinning things in my mouth , hell no !well right no we are working things out , i d rather go for the blue oneas i said , you can never trust a thing before you tried it , things can turn a way you did not expected them to . ..last but not leasr , the only person you should believ in is yourself not the perfect mum on the tv who is telling you that it s the best thing she never had in all her life .
