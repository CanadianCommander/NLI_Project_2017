yes , i agree with that because that s really happen , they try to make us buy their products by their advertisements on tv , radio , telephon and newspaper .the companies are competing now who can get more customers .most of them are not true just to keep people buy their stuff , and there are many examples about that when you watch tv they made a good advertisement to keep you buy their products .actually that stuff are not as good as they say , i believe that if i have a company i am not going to do an advertisement because the good products do not need an advertisement and i believe that many people think as i think .the advertisement plays an important rule and it has an influence on people and big affictes as well .you can see that when you go to mall or a big store there are many products some of then have an advertisement and they have no popular .in the other hand , many products have no advertisement but they have a good popular .as for me , i do not care about the advertisements in order to that no difference between them and sometimes i prefer to buy some products which do not have advertisement .finally , i believe that when you see the products are better in the advertisement that they really are , are cheating because they do not say the truth .however , they lie and cheat people , and i hope that they can change their way to sell the products and stop cheating people .
