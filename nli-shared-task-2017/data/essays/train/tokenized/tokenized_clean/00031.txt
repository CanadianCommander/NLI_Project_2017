succesful people always try to do new things this is like a habit for them .when somebody commonly journalist ask about this subject , they always answer with similar reasons such as for public acclaim or everybody wait new things from them or just for feeling .here i want to share my ideas about this subject .first of all , generally successful singers or artists have this kind of problem .they have to do diferent things every films or albums .if they do not do this , their funs can loose their interest to them .therefore this is the starting to ending for them .when they loose their admireing images , they will be nobody like ordinary people .for ` nstance old movie stars we do not remember most of them know and their star do not rising .secondly , i think to be successful is a habit for successful people due to the fact that they akways follow success .for example , some of the well known businessmen are always try to produce and sale new things .this is like a habit for them such as nokia , they alwat produce new generatin phones and sale to society .they always need to top of the mountain .they can not accept to be second .finally , if somebody being a success , all society waited new things from them .this not only their aspect but also our responcibility too ,in conclusion , successful people addicted to success , this is not always good for them .sometimes they feel unhappy .although , if they do not have this addiction , we could not establish much more .
