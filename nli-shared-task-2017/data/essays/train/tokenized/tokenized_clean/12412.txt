i think it is much better to speiclalize in a certain subject .for the following reasons .first , in modern soceity , as the science have depeloped countless subjects like clozing techniques have been created .in addition , the subjects can be classified to many branches that contains a lot of infomatrion .so if you try to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects , you will end up skimming only the surface of them and you will not practically know the subjects .on the other hand , by choosing one or two speicif subjects learners can focus on them .if you specialize the subject .you might improve and develop the subject that wll provide a great benefits to the society .second , if everyone wants and tries to have broad knowlege and avoid specializing a subject .there will be no future in each subjects .they will lose the heirs of reseach and not only be developed but also begin to regress .as the result , the society will no more expect to gain benefits form academic subjects and reseach .third , if each person specialize one thing , he might interact with others who have other specifict information .tthere are many cases that a ceatain subfect will require some information on other sujects .for example , take a look at an erectric dictionary .you can benefit from it very much .but what if there is no specific technique to desigh and produce an erictric badged could only good translators and interpreters make en erectric dictionary ?it will need both the tranlators and erectric engineers and even more experts on different subects .i definitely suggest that people should specialize one and help others in case
