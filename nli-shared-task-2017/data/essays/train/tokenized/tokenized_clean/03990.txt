i whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people .enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people in all age groups .there are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other , all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurence .both younger as well as older people have problems to face in life .each age group s enjoyment is curbed because of these problems , but the enjoyment is never far away .lets take the example of a young boy .he does not enjoy when he has to give exams , study , or go to school .however , he enjoys when he goes to play , or when he watches television .in the same way an adult ( middle aged ) does not enjoy going to work , or working around his or her hosehold .but they do enjoy when they come back from work , when they are on a holiday , or when they go to a party .in case of old people as well , they enjoy as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds .but they face problems regarding their health .so this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems .we can not draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that .along with this there is also the fact that one s enjoyment can be another s problem .in case of children , they enjoy playing more and studying less .the adults ( parents ) have problems with that , which curbs their enjoyment to see their child study .when the child is forcefully made of study , then the parents enjoyment becomes the child s problem .in case of old people , their enjoyment is that they do not need to work .but this is a problem for the adults ( middle aged ) as they become a burden on them .due to this the old people are sent to shelter homes where it is a problem for them , but enjoyment for the adults .this way everyone s enjoyment is interlinked , because of which we can not state who constantly enjoys more and who constantly enjoys less .therefore , using these two reasons , i support my stand that it is a false statement that young people enjoy more than old people .
