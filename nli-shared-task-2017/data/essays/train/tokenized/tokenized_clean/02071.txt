with the development of tourism industry all over the world , more and more people will choose to travel in their leisure time .however , the first problem the tourists will be confronted with is whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel alone .while some people may appreciate the advantage of travelling in a group for its convenience and experieced guide , i tend to choose to travel alone .the benefits of travelling alone are listed as follows : when you travel alone , you can meet new friends during the journey ; also , you can find that travelling is much more flexible than leading by a tour guide ; last , the price is lower when you travel on your own .first in first , when you travel alone , chanced are that you will make new friends during your journey and thus share your experieces and knowledge about the destination , about the world and about the real life .for example , once i travel alone in beijing , the charming city in china , it so happened that when i was trying to climb up the great wall , a stranger lent me his hand and he helped me to finish climbing the wall .after we reached the top , we were already good friends and communicated a lot on our tourist experience .up till today , he is still my best friend in my life and we keep in touch with each other by mail and share our journey .the next point of travelling alone is its flexibility .just think , if i was led by a guide , i will be forced to leave or go to a place i do nt like very much and have to go when i really want to stay for more time .while i travel alone , i can figure out my favorite places and to select the nearest routine to the destinations .whenever i want to stay for a while , i can just enjoy my time .there is no restrictions for me to travel .last but not the least , i found that travelling alone can be much cheaper than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .as we all know , every travel agency must make profit to support their business .thus , they may be overcharged on the payment .however , if i travel alone , i can save money for the sake of my own .for example , i can choose the cheapest hotel rather than the expensive one .also i can choose to travel by train rather by air , which means a lot more expenditure .as the reasons mentiond above , i prefer to travel on my own , not in a group .the opportunities of making new friends , the flexibility of my travelling time and the economic fee i have to pay for my trip are all the factors that contribute to the reason .
