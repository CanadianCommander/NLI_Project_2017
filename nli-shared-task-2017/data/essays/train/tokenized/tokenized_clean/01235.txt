the question whether is it more important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one specific subject is not easy to answer .personally , i am the opinion that a broad knowledge is worth more than a narrow but specialized knowledge .however , the business world calls for specialists all the time .back in the past allrounders were highly appreciated but nowadays there are just a few left .well , this does not apply in general but at least to the business i know , the law business .as a lawyer it is necessary to be specialized to ensure one achieves the best solution for the client .but still , i believe that broad knowledge opens new horizons .now i am not only referring to business but also to private life .having knowledge in various areas also means to have more information .information one can use to make up one s mind and to see things in a totally new perspective .this actually is why i believe broad knowledge is worth so much .only with this knowledge it is possible to understand different cultures , to enjoy foreign music , arts or simply to have an interestin talk with the neighbor who comes from a different country .with these new possibilities a totally new world is offered to the ones that are open to information on different subjects .and get back to business : who does really want to talk to a lawyer who only understands the law but not the real problem ?i does not .therefore i am the opinion that broad knowledge is more important to to be specialized on just one subject .although , it is not easy to obtain knowledge in different fields , if one has a full-time job , it is worth to spend the spare-time to gather information on other topics and subjects , provided one is interested in them .summarized i can say , that i try not to become to specialized too early and to obtain a broad knowledge .i think it is very important .
