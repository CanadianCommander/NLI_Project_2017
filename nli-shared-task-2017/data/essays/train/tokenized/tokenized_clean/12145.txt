in a first approach , we may think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people , and even more very young people like children , do nt take into account several factors of the life , and they seems to enjoy life .for example , the every-day-life of a child is not as much difficult as one of an adult .someone takes it to the park , he can play with the other children , even if he does nt know them , the communication is very easy .then when he goes back home , he do nt have to take care of the lunch or dinner , he just have to seat or to be seated and he eats .he does nt have to buy products , to cook them and so on .elder children seems still to enjoy life , and therefore they are more independant than when they were babies .they do nt have yet to borrow of earning one s living , they must just have their homeworks done .then , when one become an adult , several problems appear .first , after having chosen to make studies or not , one must find a job , and then a appartment .then there are the taxes .but people are independant .between 50 years old and 65 or 70 years olds , some people have accumulated money , and they can now have the benefits of it .they have no more young children , they may travel when they want or just where they want .of course , the elderly people , living either in their own houses or in a retirement house , do nt seem to enjoy life as mush as the younger do .of course the death ca nt be further and further . ..so they must enjoy every events , even if it may look very common for the younger people .
