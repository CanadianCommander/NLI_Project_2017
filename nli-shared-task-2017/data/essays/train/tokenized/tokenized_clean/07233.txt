i fully agree with the statement saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i will base my essay on my personal experience in order to consolidate my position .as a child , one s normally forced to learn all the concepts by heart .this applies to when we learned things such as letters , numbers and colors .however , this system only works while people are really young because when they grow up , the scenario changes dramatically .when i began my first physics course , i was used to learn everything that was written on a paper or a text book .the problem appeared when i had to solve an exercise asking me to calculate the impact that gravity had on athletes .i was unable to solve the problem with all the formulas and theories that i had learned the night before .i was completly blocked .i realised then , that understanding the ideas could be much better for me than just learning facts .i forced myself to get the idea from the sources i had and share the information found with my colleagues and teachers .this ritual or studying method allowed me to have a better picture of the problem and find a better way to solve it .since then , i started forgeting about the traditional way of studying but beginning to understand where the main idea was coming from .this way of learning is now helping me to solve the problems that i normally face when i m working .when my manager asks me to answer one of his questions , he is not waiting for me to repeat everything that i ve learned from the school but for a quick response and solution .if you do nt know what the main ideas are , you will not be able to interact with other professionals .once again , my own experience makes me confirm what i stated at the beginning .teachers and professors should take this new way of studying in order to teach their students accordingly .whatever they teach today could help their students in a future .
