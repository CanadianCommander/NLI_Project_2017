staying young is one of developped countries inhabitants s greatest concerns nowadays as the others still have to face survival issues such as starvation , ability to cope with natural catastrophes . ..indeed , people nowadays often seem ready to do almost anything to preserve their youth .why that ?i disagree with that common thought in developped countries which is , ageing brings with it sadness and boredom , and makes enjoying life hardly possible .i think is is a cultural question .indeed , being african ; yself , i can affirm that in africa , it is the contrary .only older people can really enjoy life as they have had time to figure out the meaning of life and they have been able to fulfill their destiny .they have acquired that wiseness totally inaccessible to young because of the latest ones  inexperience .i think the difference of opinin between what i will called the occidental culture and the african one stems from the fact that these cultures do nt have the same definition of enjoying life .i would say that the occidental view of enjoying life is much more hedonistic , epicurian whereas the african one is more ascetic .actually , in the developing countries  minds , someone who enjoys life is someone who has the ability of undergoing thrilling experiences , such a person goes out a lot , has a lot of friends , is able to stay on dancefloors until the sunrise .that is not my conception of enjoying life .my view concurs with the african way of thinking .it is not possible to enjoy life if you do nt even know the meaning of it .and in my opinion , young people do nt know it .they interes themselves a lot in superficial things and are unable before a certain time to be able to understand the true meaning of life .how can i claim that i enjoy life while i do nt even know what makes it so important ?and i suppose the answer to that question can only be given after having experienced a lot of ordeals .i find it quite funny the fact that the conceptions of life between the two cultures are so unlike .in my mind , the occidental one is rather superficial and shallow .it may be due to the fact that africans ca nt allow themselves to be superficial .seeing all that misery surrounding them , how could they ?it may also come from the fact , africa is a relatively quite young continent , in which ancesters  culture is still deeply rooted .
