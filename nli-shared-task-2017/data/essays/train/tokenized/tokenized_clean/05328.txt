i do agree with the statement and i woud be even more radical : i think all the advertisements try to make the products better than what they really are .sometimes they do not succeed but i think the intentions are always to present the products at best , no matter what the real features are .the reasons must be searched in the aim of the advertisement itself : an advertisement is a message that must convince and persuade people to buy the product it talks about , and to buy that exact product and not some of the others on the market .to obtain this aim the people who makes the advertisement can rarely escape the strong temptation to go beyond the line of an objective description of the product , especially if there are many similar products on the market a customer could choose from .therefore as the number of products on the market have increased esponentially , the advertisement had to introduced more and more sophisticated and intrusive mechanisms to get its aim of convincement .in this way the real features of the product advertised have lost more and more attention , in favour of other messages which are indirectly and in a more subtle way connected in our mind to the product itself .these messages make use of attractive areas like beauty , beautiful actress , actors , models are often showed connected to the product , sexual messages are also used in different ways , other messages that make use of some values and stereotypes , like brave men , happy families and so on .summing up i think advertisement has gone far beyond the limit of presenting a product , maybe ignoring the negative features and emphasizing the best ones ; it has become a powerful and intrusive activity that makes use of all the means it can to obtain its scope .it not only wants to convince people to buy something instead of something else , it also tries to create the needs of new products and services .therefore it is not surprising that many times we are convinced to buy products by the way they are presented in their advertisements , or just because we want to feel like the handsome actor using that product , but then we have to face a strong disappointment .
