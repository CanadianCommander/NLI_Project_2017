i completely agree with the statement that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in today s world the quality of the education system has certainly gone down .now a these days more stress is being put on the students to learn facts rather than focusing on the understanding of ideas and concepts .eg : a student is stressed to learn when the world war ii started or which countries were fighting in the war rather than providing an understanding to them whether the war was necessary or not ?what could be the consequences of another war of the same sort taking place in the future ?in today s world one has to be innovative , creative and original .the education system in today s world does not input any of these qualities in a child .these qualities can only be inputted through proper understanding of ideas and concepts and not by mere facts .the above mentioned qualities contribute greatly in one s success .facts are also important .a student should definitely be familiar with the historic events .eg : the date when his/her country got independence , how they got it , the names of the freedom fighters etc .but these are just for knowledge .they are not going to contribute in one s success .if a child learns only facts at school and does not understand idea and concepts then he might even have a problem finding jobs .he might not do well in his job interviews where they test your understanding of things concerned .so i definitely think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .i also hope that the education system in makes the required changes in their procedures and focuses more on the understanding of ideas and concepts rather than facts .
