in my opinion , i agree the state .because knowledge of many academic subjects include in important .the human need to relate with various things .he is grew up by various things .and make his character .having know ledge of many academic subjects , it s possible for us to deeply grow up .morever we may influence our firends and child , family .because we are interested in various things .for example if i can be specialize in one specific subject , exactly my knowledge wil become deeply about it .but i am worry about flexivlel spirit .often i may concentrate one thing , forget important things .so i think it s better to have broad knowladge of many academic subjects .it is very useful , if you can change subject , you will do it .and you become specialist and having other subject .thus it is sensible for you tohave various choosing plan in your futuer .when you will retire the your job , you will have get your favorite job .having verious ability , so this is one of the reason .second many knowledge help tocomunicate eachother , friends , family and so on .it ; s fantastic idea .because human is not one .always he help other person .he wants to help family or friends .it s possible for you to keep comunication , make a friend .this is so nice .so i think i agree it .
