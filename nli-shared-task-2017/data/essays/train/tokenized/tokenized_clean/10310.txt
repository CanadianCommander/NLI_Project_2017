one of the things which makes life more easier is the technology .technology is not improved in one day .every single person put his/her efforts to it .when they are finding something they study on what they are expert on itand after studies they get success .in my opinion no development come in by chance and people get the success on what they know .in our century people are educated to twenty ages on a specific task to make a job .if success comes wtihout any knowledge and only taking the risk no one should go to schools .however people go on a standard way like finishing a college to success in their area .moreover generally succesful people do nt try new staff .let s think an engineer working on construction business .he works on building new buildings and he is very expertise at his job .when somebody wants him to write a program and take risk .is he risk his permanent job and start to write a program .think that he starts to write a porgram is it successful ?to develop new ideas new things need knowledge .new things occur after many researches and tests in our life .for example before finding an ampule edison tries 1500 species of materials on his experiments .he was an engineer and he studied on a topic which already knows .
