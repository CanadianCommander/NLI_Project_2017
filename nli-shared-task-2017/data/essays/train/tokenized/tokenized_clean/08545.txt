i completely agree with the statement .out of my own experience , i can say that it is much better to understand the ideas and concepts behind a certain topic .it makes no sense to learn facts only be heart without understanding the real content and sense .when you simply learn something without really understanding it , you are likely to forget everything soon .after a few weeks , you will not be able to memorize what you have learned anymore .but when you really understand the idea and the concept , you will probably remember it much longer or even a life long .i experienced that phenomenon myself .it is now nearly one year ago that i passed my `` abitur  .and i have to submit that i forgot a lot . ..things i learned by heart for instance in biology have disappeared nearly completely .but on the other hand , i can remember almost everything in maths .that s because i really understood the concept behind all these maths operations .in my opinion , it is a shame that you learn so hard and in the end you forget everything again .that can not be the objective of effective learning !so the only conclusion from this can be that it is essential to understand what you are learning .at the moment , i m studying business studies and in order to use all the concepts i learn at university ( like audit methods , accountibility , portofolio diversification etc . )in my later job , it is important that i understand them .there is no other way !you can only be good and successful when you know what you are actually doing .consequentely , i can only recommend everyone not to simply learn things by heart .that makes no sense !teachers should support this idea as well .they should nt ask their pupils to learn facts and figures , but to understand the things they have thought them .
