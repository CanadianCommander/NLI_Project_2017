experts of the bussiness world determine our era as the era of advertisement .it is something we are not much aware of .however , the firms are aware of that .probably , we all have experienced buying something that we do not need but we bought just because it was very attactive .however , there is a fact much worse than this ; they fool us by these advertisements .because they mainly make the products seem much better than they are .advertisement make the products seem much better in two ways ; by false impressions and by creating brands .first problem is the false impression created by these advertisements .to start with we may talk about the main ideas emphasized in advertisements .according to the type of the product advertisements emphasize features like quality , attaractiveness , functionality etc .however , most of the time it is only the impression they want to give us .in reality you will face a bad quality , ineffective , nonsense product just after you bought it .forexample , last year i bought a tracking boat .the advertisement was saying that it is water resistant and you can not damage it for long years .it absorbed water and the plastic part of the shoes were damaged just in the first use in tracking .secondly , the advertisements create brands which also make products seem much better than they are .it is clear that being a brand in your field is very important in our age .however , it seems that solely advertisements can create brands .even a newly established firm can give the feeling that their brand symbolises confidence , quality etc. by means of some advertisements .let me illustrate again with my shoes .i had bought them believing that their brand was very confidential .however , they were disturbed shortly and when i tried to find someone to tell my dissappointment i could not find anyone .actually , i have learned that it was a mal-functioning firm with no reliability .i am really angry for being fooled by advertisements which make products seem much better than they are .both giving false impressions and by creating brands they make us to do bad decision .
