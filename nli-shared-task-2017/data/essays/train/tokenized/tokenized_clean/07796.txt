many people say that young people these days do nt give enough time to helping their communities .i agree with this statement because modern society is a fast-paced world , capitalism s basis is individualism , and that many people do nt live in one place for a long time .the first reason why i agree with the statement is because the world we live in today goes really fast .every day is a busy one , with not many leisure time .young people are busy getting their education , and adults are busy working and earning money .this gradually leads to less noticing the community we live in , which decreases the help given by people .also , almost every country in the world is run by capitalism , and the basis for capitalism is individualism .individualim means that each person cares only about oneself , especially things that are benefitial to him .helping the community may be benefitial in the future , but it is not an immediate one , so people tend to not care .the final reason is that people nowadays do nt stay in one place for a long time , so they do nt feel interested in the place they live in .in the past , when transportation was nt very developed , a majority of people lived where they were born for most of their life time , so they love the society thay live in .they will be happy to help the community that they have known for so long .in contrast , it is very easy to move around in modern society , so people do nt feel the love for the community .there are many more reasons that back up the fact that young people nowadays do nt give enough time to helping their community , but in my opinion , i think that these three are the main reasons .if a community gave advantages to people who help the community more , everyone would be happy to make the community they live in a better place .
