` modernization and globalization  accompined with uncontrolled developments lead to energy crisis and lack of resources in coming twenty century .i agree with the statement as definitely this rapid growth would results in adverse effects on cars availability in coming twenty years .though somemay disagree to hold numbers will increase as big boom in market and rapid industralization .the most important concept of holding the statement as it population is increasing tremendousaly day by day and demand is also high compare to production .there is concern about to fulfill their demands lead to more cars but also lead to traffic , noice problem .as today everyone believe in comfort life , good standard of living by using cars .nobody is concerning about the result of these would lead to energy crisis .the pertroleum resources are vanishing day by day , and one there would be cars but no oil , which is life of engine .similarly , as the cost of crude oil we purchasing from gulf countries increasing rapidly .this means that in near future it is not affordable to country to rely on it , so automatically it is warn signals to automobile industries like , tata motors , bajaa , honda to think and to take appropriate action .however , some believe the fact is wrong .they holds the opinion that nothing will happen as we have technology , talent to find alternative energy sources like bio-diesel , bio-cells , cng .therefore i strongly believe that the numbers of cars will reduce drastically in coming tweenty years because of modernization , rapid growth , population and pollution and energy crisis .but i suggest that we should develop some alternatives to maintain growth , to focus on biodiesel to run cars .
