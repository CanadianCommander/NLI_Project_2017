there are some out there who think that the facts are more important than the ideas or different concepts .others think in completly opposite manner .as far as i concered the i have always been follower of the true fact that is practical stuff .i have some example to support my statement .firstly , the importance of facts should be understood in more broader manner , the ideas and concepts are derived by facts .so if one can not understand the fact , it would be diffcult to understand the ideas and concepts behind certain fact .i have one astonishing example of einstin .i have read in the magazine ( reader s digest ) that he always understood the concept and ideas by experiencing facts .the theory of gravity is perfect example of the , fact coming first and then the concept and ideas .secondly , the facts represents the overall idea behind it .so why not learn facts first then the ideas ?in fact , if you consider or hold very much importance of the fact , you are bound to understand the concepts behind it .most of scientists derive their thoery by understanding the certain facts in most perfect manner .so i think it is really important to foucs of te learing different facts .thirdly , student should focus of the pratical knowledge , which holds tremeadous importance in really life .i , myself , is perfect example , being a civil engineer , the fact behind every condition holds a important .in some condition , we obivously require the understanding for concept .but most of the time the learning fact is key .in the end , the point i like to conclude is the students as far as possible should foucus learing and understanding the critical facts of any subject .
