we can think about many ways to study our academic subjects .one way is to make one s knowlege of several academic subjects broaden , and another one is to concentrate on specific subject .i think the former ways are the better .the reasons why i think so are as follows ;first , modern society is very complex and difficult to understand by a narrow width of knowleges about a certain academic concern .the aspect of technogical improvement and changed social environment force us to know things with more broaden and open sights .for example new genetic technologies need us to study not only genetics but also chemistry , bioloy and so on .second , to have broad knolwege of many subjects can help us to view things more accuratetly .if we know only some field and not know any other thing , then we can not figure out what s going on in our society .if you do nt know economics because you do nt have interst in that field , you can not undestand why national economy is less active .another example .some parents have difficulty in explaining some easy scientific phenomenons for their children , it may lead their childeren to lose their interst in science and they can not know our surroundings .third , knowledges of a field can be linked to other fields  knowledge ultimately .economy is related to polictics .so we have to know and learn various things in academic fields .thus , i think we need to learn various fields
