some people have broab knowledge of many academic subjects , which means that they know little on many many different things , some others know a lot about only a few subjects , which means that they re specialized in those subjects .what is the best ?as far as i m concerned , i really believe that students should touch a little bit evrerything , they should be in the know , not only about the different subject they have in class , but also about what happens in the outside world of their university .i think that if somebody has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects it shows its mind-openess and its interrest for what others learn and study .nevertheless , if you know little about many different things you can take part on a lot of conversations , but as soon as it gets to the core of the matter you get lost , given that it will be to specific for you and you wo nt be able to answer questions .on the other hand , if you know a lot about only a few subjects you can depen conversations on those you know but you ca nt even take part at conversations which deal about something you may never have heard about , or you can ask but the other peolple may look at you as if you where from another planet .that is the risk you undertake .so to resume my opinion , i think that there has a balance to be found between having a broad knowledge on many different academic subjects and beeing specialized in only one .that means that one should be open-minded and have a lot of different points of interest but in the same time that one should know everything in an exact way about one or maximum two specific subjects .
