i think there are two kinds of people :the first kind is good in knowing general topics and so this kind has a good broad knowledge .the second typ is good in knowing specific information about one topic .we need both kinds of people to manage the living on our earth , because experts are needed to make new discoveries in science , nature or anything else .without this experts our technical evolution could nt be continued .the human beeings who have the general knowladge are good to `` tidy up  our world .they can create a system in which we can put the lot of information we get every day .such men or women are also neccessary for our culture , way of live and organisation of the live .without the experts we would nt be so far in technique and social status , probably we would live with the dinosaurs , but without the other group , we would nt be able to understand all of the new things that are invented or discovered or die under the mountain of ideas , new topics and inventions .the most specialists are not good in explaining new things , because the most speak in their own language .every topic has its  own language so you are not able to know what s going on . ..we need a good balance between specialist and people who have a good broad knowledge .i ca nt say the one is better than the other !i think that i m am specialist who knows one or to topics next to another realy good , but not the rest .and my brother knows much more topics , but not so deep like me .together we are a really good team wich can solve a lot of problems in a very efficient way .so this is a good example for what i ment in this essay .everybody only have to know what he wants and maby a little more and nobody should be discriminated because of his knowledge or unknowledge .
