somebody who begins to study has two possibilities : he can on one hand choose to learn things on different topics , and he can on the other hand choose to specialize directly on one subject .but what is the best choice ?the first possibility - learning a lot of details on many subjects - is quite interesting because it gives people good general knowledges so that they can speak on many subjects and discuss with different people .in france , we can choose this way by entering `` science politique  .this school permits people to be particularly well informed and to give their opinion on every subject .the second possibility - specializing on one specific subject - is also interesting because it gives people the possibility to be very competent on their subject .if somebody told you his or her opinion on it , you can response with a lot of precisions and impose , if you are right , your point of view .this possibility is provided by very specialized and professionnals schools which give young students those precise knowledges .in fact , if you choose the first solution , you are not going to be able to speak seriously on one particular subject .you can just say different things on it but not very precisely .at the opposite , if you choose the second solution , you would be competent only on one subject and quite ignorant on the others .the solution is to begin with studying different topics on litterature , science , technologies , and languages .this first period gives the student the time to discover those different subjects , to construct his own culture .it gives also him or her the possibility to choice what he or she prefers .indeed , if you choose too soon , you can make more easily a mistake .when you have choosen , begins the second period during when you will work on the subject you choose so as to be competent on that one , but not without other knowledges on other subjects .this is a balanced solution who permits us to work on a topic and , at the same time , not to be isolated in you knowledges .
