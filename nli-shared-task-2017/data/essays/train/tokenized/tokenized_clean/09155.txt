i agree that there will be fewer cars in the near future , because current technological and scientific developments prove to alleviate man s desire and need of mobility by driving .other means of transportation have come to be used much frequently over the last 10 years due to the fact that they cost much lesser than they used to .flying , instate and out of state , is more common and practical by all means .besides , when i consider the urgency of fuel in each individual vehical , i can not help but think that the earth s reserves should not last long enough to support such spenditure .although planes run on fuel , they carry much more people at a single occasion .just as means of transportation have developed , our habbits of communication have also changed and we have become more mobile , meaning more accessible , so that we do not have to drive to those places where we are expected .our daily jobs are mostly handeled from our desks ; over the internet , or on phone .the unstoppable growth of mobile phone technology enables us to be at multiple stations at the same time .we can drive while we are ordering pizza over the phone and keep a client on hold on the car phone .as far as technology goes , perhaps , we will not even need feul-oil cars in the 20 years to come .the most recent technology pormises to developed more profound models of solar cars , or hydra automobiles .world s leading environmental foundations support , both financially and ideologically , that more investments should be bestowed upon technological improvements so that alternative modes of transportation can be attained .i strongly believe that the world may turn out to be a less polluted and peacefull abode afterall .20 years may not be a lot of time considering the historical developments of people ; yet , a lot can be achieved in such a duration if the drives and the motives are right .less fuel consumption , lesser car , and car accidents for that matter , may be a few motives for starters .
