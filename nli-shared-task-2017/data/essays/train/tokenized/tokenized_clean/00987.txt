i do nt completely agree with this statement .in a certain way , young people ( young adults ) enjoy life more than older ones , but , older people do enjoy life , at least certain aspects of it .of course , it also depends on your definition of `` enjoying life  .when you are young , healthy , when you do nt have responsabilities yet , you probably enjoy life : travelling , going out , practice sports .for instance , travelling requires a certain physical ability : enduring a 12 hour flight , an eight-hour jet lag , different weather . ..young people adapt more easily to these changes , while for older people , it takes more time .but the counter point of being young , is that you have to study or work to build yourself a future , so you might not have as much time as someone who is retired .enjoying life for young people nowadays sometimes means taking drugs , which can cquse irreversable damage , and because of that , they wo nt be able to enjoy life as older people .but on the other hand , when you are older , in general , you have more money and more time to spend .for example , older people in their early retirement years .they are still healthy , they have more money than a 20 year old student , they can travel where they want , for as long as they want .but with age comes responsability .you get older , you have a family to support , you ca nt go out clubbing every saturday night .and , when you get older , health is nt always on your side .and with a bad health it is more difficult to enjoy small pleasures of life , for example , skiing when you have a bad knee , going to a concert when your hearing is getting worse .as you grow older , your occupations change .when you are 20 , you like going to clubs and dancing all night long , but by the time you are 45 , you prefer a quiet night with a couple of friends .this is still enjoying life , just at a different level .some people say the point of being young is to enjoy life , but what s the point if when you re 50 , you have a heart disease that s unables you to do the things you like ?
