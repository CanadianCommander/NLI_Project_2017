last november seemed colder than usual , not because of the early winter gust winds , but because of one man who has been forgotten deeply in my mind for a year .i stared at the portrait of this man .around me was only the mourning sound combined by high and low vocal sounds .the man in the portrait-my father-was gone in my early life .a korean proverb says that the flower produces sweet fruits only after it loses its beautiful petals .while anyone might expound its meaning thorugh the abstract-that perseverance thorough hardship is rewarded-i decided to illustrate its significant meaning thorugh various aspects of my life .in a sense , it is the maxim that drives and motivates me not to be succumbed to people s common pessimism toward people without parents .perseverance strenghthens my body .few years ago , i committed myself to a class to learn kungfu .but it was more than a leisurely hobby to sate some restless action film-inspired teenages ; it was a process of grueling training under a demanding master who was quick to rebuke any faults .in a short time , every other student quit , having grown weary of awaking at dawn on weekends for the sake of physical exhaustion .i knew better ; rather than be discouraged by the sudden trend , i reasoned that the benefits of continuing-physical fitness , discipline , and competency in legendary martial art-far outweighed the costs-foregoing the chance to sleep in .through the course of two-year regimen , i continued to learn , emerging with confidence ahead of those who had quit under exertion .rather than be discouraged by the past , i found the source of comfort and challenge by refusing to succumb to ethical temptations for the sake of physical convenience .perseverance tempers my emotion .when cancer claimed my father s life last year , it was inevitably difficult .it was not a simple process , but i learned that the most important form of perseverance is hope .through hope , bitter memories of my father s death were redirected into fond nostalgia of his life ; worrisome lingering on whta the had left uncompleted truned into excitement at the prospect of accomplishing his dreams myself .a korean trained businessman with a profound knowledge of international economy , one of his goals was to study in the united states .inspired by his rich life , i seek to fulfill our common goal in the united states to share there my own unique korean living in china .so far , i have shed many petals of tears and sweat .unlike many fellow students of mine at school , i ve lost the most important source of inspiration in life-father .unlike my friends , i , one of the young people for my age , failed to enjoy my life by not caring for the hidden inspiration of my life in the past .i believe that the sweetest fruit yet lies at the time i become old myself like my father .
