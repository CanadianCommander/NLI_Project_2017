i strongly agree with the statement , as i personally experiance the feeling .in life we need to enjoy every part , though it is related to money , adventure , drama etc .elders are always frightened as they always think of future than present .but youngsters are dam bothered about future .for an example when i am in schooling i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me , but finally they sent me with more cautions .after comming back , they have seen my video of my bangee jump in tour and started scoldind me though i safely came back .they are always more coutious in life and they never try for any adventure .i feel adventure is also part of enjoyment .spending money is economy for elders but for youngers money doesnt matter for enjoyment .when i started earning , i started spending for my own expenditure like resturants , outing with friends , enjoying weekends , but my parents dont like this as they want me to save money for my future .i feel that we need to enjoy when we have oppurtunity , as time never comes back .we can earn money through out our life .youngsters like dressing in modern way as per there comfort whereas elders feel that young ones needs to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern is not means that we are loosing our tradition .finally i conclude that thinking of all these elders are loosing all enjoyments whereas young people are enjoying more than them .
