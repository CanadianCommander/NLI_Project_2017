in every time and every parts of the world , young people are criticized that they had changed for bad , especially by the adults .and always it is partly true .but this time i disagree with the statement , which says young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think , nowadays young people rather do give enough time to helping their communities .today , let me explain my opinion and supporting reasons .first of all , young people are said to be so much indulged that they do not contribute for the community by the adults .but i think , they become much more active for their communities than adults says .i saw a documentary film about the cleen-up project in shibuya .in that film , even girls called gals or guys like teamers , who are most likely to be explained dull and infavor of anything , take part in the project .actually , when gals expressed their opinion to others , they seems to be more enthusiastic than any other adults same participate in the project .so it means that they sincerely think of their communities , and give their time and passion .and secondly , someone says that young people are not interested in their community so they do not give their times in to helping their communities .but i oppose that opinion either .my friend takes part in sanja festival in asakusa for 10 years , and she found interests in it .and amazingly , not only her is the person who thinks that .year by year the young people who take part in the festival increases .it means that , if communities open up to youths and communicate with them more , young people interested in their activity .i think , everyone should do something before being analogous to young people for how less helpful young people are , and how less time young people use for communities .youths always have interest , and time for their communities to use .i can say that , only if having very little opportunity , young people are more active for helping their community .
