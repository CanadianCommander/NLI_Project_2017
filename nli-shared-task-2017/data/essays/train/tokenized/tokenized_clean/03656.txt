modern societes are thinking more individually than ever .this is a result of multiple factors that i will shortly describe in this writting .the first factor is the metropoli concept .at the beggining of the 20th century , there were no so many cities in the world with more than a million of habitants .today , one can realize more than 50 cities with more than 10 million of habitants .the metropolis has many implications in the way of living , in terms of competitivity for a workplace , time dedicated to educational activities , time and resources invested in transportation .day after day time invested at home is decreasing and the young people quite often do not see with treir parents as they have so many things to do , but the family is not a priority anymore .a second factor is the revolution of communication media and all what it has brought to society .the media influence over the people is huge .unfortunately what bring cash to the media companies are the stars programs .i have not seen any top series for young that focuses their attention to comunitary programs , obviously , that wo nt have any rating .the third factor is the lack of believes .as a human being , is important to believe in a superior god , no matters if is christian , methodist , budism , etc .the believes and practices of a religion are the basis of a community .the final factor is that the education at schools are focusing more in technical formation than humanistic , focusing students more in `` me  thinking than in a community thinking .technical education is basic , but moral education is as important and shoul be teached in the same way and intensity .multinational and global corporations works as a community , share a corporate culture and values , and from my point of view , that is the only way that one could guarrantee sustainability .one of the basis of leadership is to work in groups to bring results foto the community and youngs should be advised of the importance of helping their communities .
