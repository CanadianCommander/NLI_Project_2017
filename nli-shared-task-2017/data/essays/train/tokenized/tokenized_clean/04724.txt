i disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in my opinion , learning facts is more important and efficient for studemts .there are three reasons .first reason is that facts are efficient in a real situation .second reason is that facts always follows a reality .therefore , it helpes to solve a problem .third reason is that people learn the idea and concepts through the facts .first of all , the facts are always efficient in a real situation .for example , in business , people do nt know what to do when they face problems although they have knowledge about a concept of business .concept is just a concept .fact and the skill that business people need in real situation is mostly different from the concept .business people who knows pefectly about concept and idea do nt always succeed in business because a market is very complicated and always change .in another words , the fact in the market is always changing .therefore , they have to flexibly keep up with the cahnge of the fact .secondly , the reality does not always follow the reality .there are so many accidents .therefore business people need to know as many cases and solutions as possible which may be needed in reality .thirdly , people can learn concepts and ideas through the facts .learning concepts through the facts and real experience is more efficient for us to work in reality than learning only concepts and ideas .if i do nt know about the facts , i will not be able to have a good solitions
