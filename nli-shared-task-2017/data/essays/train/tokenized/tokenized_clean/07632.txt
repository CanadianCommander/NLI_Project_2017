while the factual information is important part of acadamics , i believe the understanding of ideas and concepts are more importnat to students .suppose darwin only studied facts by anlaysing the artifacts without further delveloping idea and concepts based on thoses facts , the studies on the human evolution as we know would not exsisit today .while the factual imformation provides the basis for theories , such facts will bring no academic value if one does not utilize them to develop concepts .also , if wright brothers never explored the idea and concepts of flying , the aviation industry would not have developed as we know today .we can not disregard the factual information required to develop morden airplanes but thoese are also the products of new concepts .it industy is also a good reflection of new ideas and concpets .without the concepts and ideas for the computers , softwares , internet , e-mails , etc. we would not have been able to experience the convinience of modern technology .there is no denying that the facts and science are behind the modern technology .however , a mankind would not have made such as great acheivements without exploring our imagination and developing idea and concepts into a reality .therefore , i believe it is important for student to understand idea and concepts while paying respect for them to learn facts .
