as a response to the question `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars that there are today  , i strongly believe that this statement holds true for numerous reasons .firstly , the production of cars increases annually due to the increase of demand all over the world .hence , the emission produced by the higher number of cars present will endanger the environement causing health problems for animals as well as human beings .when this problem arises , countries from all over the world might decide to restrict the emission output of every country to a certain number , with the goal of controlling and therefore reducing the emission output of cars in the world .this will lead to less cars being produced and hence , fewer cars being present on the roads in each country .secondly , from personal experience in istanbul , turkey , i have noticed that the amount of cars have increased on the roads and highways in the last three years , causing long traffic jams and more serious accidents .as this will become more frequent in the near future , i believe that the turkish government will take control of the situation , limiting the amount of cars sold thus reducing the number of cars used in turkey .in this respect , i think that every country will go about the same procedure if similiar problems arise in their country .another reason for supporting this statement is that the political and economic situations in many of the westernized countries have become more critical in recent years .germany , as an example , has difficulties in their economy as it has been declining for years causing the living standards to drop .in a few years time , many people will not be able to affort a car .due to similiar problems slowly spreading over many western countries , it will also affect their economy causing people not being able to afford a car .this will result in less cars being used in the next twenty years .the recently increasing petrol and oil prices due to the crises in the middle east , has lead many people in numerous countries , such as germany , to stop using a car .they rarther use public transport as this is a much cheaper solution for them .in conclusion , i strongly believe that the amount of cars used in twenty years will be much less due to the above mentioned reasons .
