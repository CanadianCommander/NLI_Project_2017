cars have been played an important role .they influence the economy and techology all over the world .i disagree with that fewer cars will be used than they are today .there are four reasons .first of all , citied keep developing and people keep making roads , so a lot of cars will be needed for people if the roads will keep increasing .second , not only the roads increase , but also the population keep increase .more the population increases , more the demand of using cars will increase .if there are a lot of demand , people try to make more cars to satisfy the demand , which is the relationship between demand and supply .this relationship are necessary for develop the economy , and especially cars have influenced the world market .therefore , cars will be needed more and more .next , using cars are one of the way to transport .it s so convenient to go to places which are even far away and also comfortable to use cars because we do nt need to be accustom ourself to the public atmosphere .in contrast , when we take other transportations like a bus or train , we always have to pay attention to others .thus , we can feel relax and enjoy our own spaces by using cars .finally , while some people may think using cars pollutes the environment , we have studied for the new way to develop cars which do nt give bad influence to the environment since technology has kept developing .in fact , we have made the new tipe of car which does nt cause co2 by making energy from solving water .these attempts will contribute to solve environmental problems .for the above reasons , i disagree with that fewer cars are ufs
