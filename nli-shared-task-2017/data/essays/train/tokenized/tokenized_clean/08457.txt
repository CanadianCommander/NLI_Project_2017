advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our lives in the 21st century .everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our tvs or newspaper pages to show us his advantages .people have different ideas about the issue that most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking .i m personally agree with the firt ones .first of all , advertisements make the products seem bigger .every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that ` this one  is the ` one  that you have been looking for since your childhood .to make you believe they will try every method , especially do not believe in the size of the product in the television .for example last year a newspaper begin to promote a tape .the tape was the best that i have ever seen , i mean ` the tape of my life  .i ordered the product and when the box came to my home i was really amazed , however , there was a little problem ; the tape was more little than i saw it in the advertisement .secondly , most advertisements make the audience believe that the product is cheaper .the life in big cities like my own is very expensive to live .so , i am really careful about spending my money and always looking for the prices of the materials that i will buy and i am always looking for the information on prices in the advertisements .for the 20th birthday of my best friend i promised her to buy the dress that we saw in the magazine together .in the adverstisement it was not looking so expensive .i was thinking like that until i went the store to buy it .it was much more expensive than we read .lastly , advertisements make the material seem more useful .for instance , a friend of mine who has a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised as a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 months  , it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo . ..the product seem her much more useful than she experienced .thus the information told by advertisers is not so accurate and convincable .all in all , adverstising a product is something made to show that it is the best that you ve ever seen .so , the advertisers will try to fascinate the audience and by making the stuff seem better than it really is , they reach their goals .the products shown in the advertisement can be smaller , more expensive and less useful than it is seem to you .
