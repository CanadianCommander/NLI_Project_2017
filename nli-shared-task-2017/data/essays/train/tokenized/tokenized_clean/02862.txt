i agree with this statement .for example my mom is successful business woman .she started working for air china when she gruduated in 1985 , and she is the president right now after she had worked 22 years , she had a long journey before she did that .first of all is her english , my mom was really good at math and science when was in college , but was weak in english , and she did nt know any foriegn language either .but my family was really poor awhen i was born so we needed money .air china was a company that needs language and experience more than teceniques and it s richest inchina during that period of time too .my mom made her mind that she wanted to work there and get nice salary in order to feed our family better and easier .she went to the language school and had extra english classes every night , i still remember clearly that when she came back her eye were like the panda s .i almost begged my mom to stop doing that because she ca nt take it , she was alsomt sick .but she said that s her confifence and her goal and she will never lose .she was the greatest i have even seen , she got a job in air china after 3 month because she passed the super hard english test .i was shocked by her achivement and felt so happy for her .my mom did nt stop either although she had a nice job and got paid $ 5000 a month .she went to germany and japan for two years for more experience and languages .who my mom came back and said she wanted to voted for the president of the entire company , i did nt trust her and said she was crazy , it s impossible .my mom did nt yell me instead she said that s called faith to herself , faith to the society and faith to me .i promised her that i trust her .when it was the chinese new year in 2003 , mom came home with the uniform of the president and cried , she did it !!we huged together and had the best night ever .now she is working extremely hard every day , gets paid $ 20000 per month and i support her every day , the company is better and better , so does her life and our life , because we are one .i have the money to pay for the fee of an exchange student , to take the test and come back for college if i pass this test because of my mom s effort .the definition of faith refreshed my brain and i became more mature .i like this statement , i appreciate and i ll remember it forever .
