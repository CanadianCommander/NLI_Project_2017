in my student experiences , i often used the memory to learn the fact , in the case of the lesson with a lot of dates , names or formulas but i ve always had the fundamental idea that studying without understanding principles , concepts that are at the basis of the facts could be an unuseful work .in fact , knowing the einstein s formula , but then not understanding the principle of the gravity energy is not intellingent , beacuse even if you worked only with your memory .my ph.d. advisor , a professor in coastal engineering , doest usually remember all of the drag coefficient values that appears in the darcy formula but he reflects about its significance and , using the knowledge of the pricipal laws and the practical sense , is always able to give me the more realistic value for all of types of surfaces .i often loose this practical ability to understand the real problems and the ideas that is hidden by the formula .for a student , it s simpler to learn facts , even if often the professors asked them to refer themselves to a specific number , or a particula paragraph of the book .the student , also for this reason , is used to prefer to learn facts , without really comphend the general topics .now i m not a student and i know that only the really understood concepts are placed in my mind while all the formulas and numbers that filled my memory in thelast year , are now vanished .so , i usually suggest to my student to understand the concept that are below a formula or a mathematical law and to not learn only with the memory !!
