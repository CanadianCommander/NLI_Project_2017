i almost agree with this statement , but i think some criticize can be inferred .actually for some context it is obviously better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , like in college or with others students but also to be abble to choose what you want to do .while to be specialize in one specific subject can close some possiblities , but it wil be easier to be outstanding in one specific subject .on the one hand to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the system of all schools , when you are young you do nt learn just french or math , you have learned everything in the same time .there is a reason of this system , he has been created to be allow the student to be open minded , the history show us how is important to be not focus on only one thing , even the great genius was nt focused on only one subject .lets take an example , leonard da vinci was a genius in paint so during his life he has developed this quality , but not only he was also interested by the biology , more specefically how the human body works .on the other its allows to choose what you really want to do .for me it is important to have choice between diferents specialities , i mean i have to know a little bit of everything if i want to make a good choice about my future .for example when i was young i was really interested by litterature , i started to read really early so i thought maybe the best thing for me is to take litterature class later , but i realized how wrong i was when i discovered my love for biology .so i decided to not make choice between two things that i love , i decided to try another academic subjects , to know a broad of everything , and maybe later i will specialize .now , i study in law college so i am specialized but it s ok because i made some diferents things before i choose law .so i just to improve myself in law , which is already hard but more easier than if i have all academic subjects .
