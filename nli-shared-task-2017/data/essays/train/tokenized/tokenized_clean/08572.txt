i have always been and still is an `` understanding  kid .i could never learn the facts as `` such and such is such preiod .i had to think about it until i knew and understood the main reason why such and such is such and such .it was a good habit of studying for when there were comprehensive questions , i would find it easy to apply the things i learned in to real-life settings .once understood , i would then be able to learn higher level knowledge on the same topic .things i tried to memorize as facts never semmed to sink-in and stay .it is because of my personal experience that i agree with the statement , `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .first , in present day life , you ca nt always learn facts and memorize it .in the past accepting and learning facts were the means of education .however , now it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts .every now and then we here about the imp [ ortance of creativity .creativity comes from understanding ideas and concepts and applying them to situations to make new things , handle the hard problems in the situation , and make new ideas .in present day life , you the ablitiy to understand is important especially to growing students .second , the `` facts  are always changing .it was a fact that the no man could ever reach the moon befora the space shuttle was invented .it was a `` fact  that the earth was the center of the universe couple centries ago .the `` facts  change as people learn more and more about their surroundings .if the facts are learned without students actually understanding the concept , it would be hard for them to take in the new `` facts  or understand why the fact has changed .also , it would be impossible to have great scientists if all students belived that facts are facts and none of them will ever change becaus they learned it this way .last , it is a more effective way of studying .for students who have a limited amount of time to study 8 to12 subjects time efficientcy is very important .by understanding a concept or ideas the students can take in all the things that are related to that subject .because of the reasons stated above , i agrree with the statement , `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .
