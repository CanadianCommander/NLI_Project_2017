i completely agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .advertising is all about projecting the brand image of the product .the idea of adversting is to improve the sales of the product .this necessarily means attracting customers to their product .the means to attract lies in the image they project .so , it comes as no surprise if the advertisers make their product look the best .when projecting the image of the project , anyone would tend to speak about the positive points .how could they expect their product to be sold if they project the negative shade of the project ??but the problem lies in the fact that the advertisers tend to go overboard with the qualities of their products .their steps in making the product desirable to the audience are appreciated , but not at the cost of the trust or belief people have in it .the main aim is to gain advantage over the competitors product .so , they try to grasp the negative aspects associated with the competitor s product and project an image of their product .this image necessarily speaks about what qualities are there in the products that their competitors do nt provide .the head & shoulders advertisement comes as a reference in this regard .it might not be as successful in removing dandruff as it projects itself to be .some advertisements even tend to put the health of individuals in jeopardy .one classic example i can give in this regard is the soft drinks .the recent coke controversy serves as a classic example to this fact .recently , there was some evidence that coke has some unreasonable amount of pesticides in it .when coke is projected as a healthy and safe drink , evidences to this degree act as a blot on the reputation .but i wonder if the products would sell off if true information is advertised .imagine the sales of h & s if it says `` try out for yourself  rather than projecting their good image .or if coke people say  be careful .this drink might be harmful to health  .but one thing i can be sure .this advertising world is for people to sel their brands and they would do it at the best way possible .
