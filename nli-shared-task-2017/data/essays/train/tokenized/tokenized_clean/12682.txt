some people may say that they need to broaden their knowledge in many different subjects to get more chances .but i believe that it is more important to be specialize in one specific subjects than knowing little about everyting because of two reasons .which is that it is a waste of time and effort and that the company wants a specialist in certain field .first of all , studing all the subjects that you do nt need is a waste of time and effort .people are living in a busy life and i think that they should put these effort and time to their majors .for example , in korean high school we have a lot of subjects that you do nt really need .students do nt understand why they are learning this but they are studying for these subjects just because of the exam .i think that students should instead put their time and effort in the fun activities or hobbies that they like to do .secondly , thesedays the companys need specialists who are good at one specific field .this is becoming popular because most of the colleges have many programs that the students can just get into college with one subject that they are really good at .these subjects can be such as computer skills , launguages ability , arts and ect .thus , if you are way better at english than most of your friends , you can develop on your language skills to be better at it and you will become a specialist that many company wants to hire .because of these reasons i think that having a subject which you are extremely good at is better than being just good at many subjects .i believe that each every one has different interests and talents which should be encouraged to be develop .
