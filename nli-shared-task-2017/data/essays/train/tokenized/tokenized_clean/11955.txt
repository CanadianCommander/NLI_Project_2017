according to me the advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .the sole purpose of advertisements are to promote the sale of a product .in todays competetive society , the advetisers would do anything to attract our attention .they put famous celebrities in their adds and pay millions of dollars to the t.v .stations to broadcast their adds .almost all adds are different and inovative , however they all have one thing in common - they all highlight only the good points about their product .they never inform the consumer what their product lacks .often , a person finds a difference of day and night between a product seen in the advertisement and the actual product .the companies usually ameliorate the appearence of the product when they advertise it , through computer graphics .they make it more appealing than it really is .once i saw an advertisement of an acne face wash .the results of the product seemed amazing .the interviews of the users were shown in advertisement .they were all happy with the product and asked everyone to used the product .intimidated by the add , i ordered the product .the product seemed completely inaffective and useless .i was dissapointed and from that time on i made a resolution of never using a product without personal research .hence , we should not fall prey to the tempting advertisments which the companies show us , since they are far from reality
