nowadays many advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i agree with this statement for many reasons .i could say that in the world of business the most important characteristic is the honesty , so if a company makes an advertisement that makes a product seem much better than they really is this company will probably loose a lot of customers .i think that this consequence that i ve explained is a risck for every companies .after stating that loosing a lot of clients are a risck for a company , in other words i can say that if this company does nt change the advertisement it will surely loose all tha customers and failed in the end .i think that nowadays a company must make large efforts to survive and the most important effort is to improve the honesty of the advertisement to make the products seem like they really are .for example , i recently take a new car that seems a wonderful car in the advertisement .initially this car does nt make noise and does nt make problem to me but after a mounth it begins to stop more often and it begins to have a lot of problems .furthermore i have to spend more money to adjust this car than the money that i spend to buy it .the company that give me the car has lose a customer and also customer s friend .in any experience of mine i would wish that first of all the companies or the person are honest .concluding among all the possible facts the most important aspect in every business is the honesty .as a matter of fact all the companies shold make an effort to improve the advertisement of their products .
