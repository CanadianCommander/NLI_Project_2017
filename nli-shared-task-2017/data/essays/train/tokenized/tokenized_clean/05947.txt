i completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two main reasons for that : they give a perfect appearance of an object that is not always that beautiful , and they represent some products as being able to do things that are quite improbable .first of all , most advertisements work on the physical aspect of the product in the picture or commercial .this is intented to show a perfect physical aspect of the product , but this does nt always reflect the reality .for example , when you watch a mcdonald s commercial , they give the burgers a much prettier image than the one you will actually hold in your hand when you order it yourself .another example would be makeup commercials , in which all products seem to have a magical effect , when in fact , the lighting and beautiful models boost their apparent efficiency .these representations are intended to make the consumer buy the product , but he or she will most probably be disappointed when trying it .second of all , most advertisements display their products as being able to do things that are quite improbable , or at least very difficult .one major example for this is car advertising on television , which may show the vehicle climbing cliffs , engaging on racing tracks , or going into wild nature without any problem .in each case , and for any vehicle advertised , the product is not only shown as being adapted for these actions , it is also presented as the better one .this is surely not possible for all of those cars , at least not with an everyday-life driver .although some of the advertisements may represent products accurately , the marketing rules lead advertisers to make strong endeavors to represent the product as well as they can to attract the consumer , even if it is not the exact reality .
