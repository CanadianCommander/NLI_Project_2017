have you ever noticed about the issue that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialized in one specific subject .in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects provides people broden their scope .besides , it can people learn a lot of things and enrich their life .first of all , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can broden people scope .for example , learning many subjects provides an opportunity to know many people .people have different religions , cultures , experiences .during learning different subjects , people share their knowledge and experiences with each other .it can open each other s mind and absorb much informaation .as a result , learning many academic subjects can open our mind .secondly , learning many academic subjects can learn a lot of things .experts and scholars pass their knowledge by the books .from the books , we learn their knowledge .therefore , by learning the books from many academic subjects , we will prevent the mistakes they made and become wise and smart .for xample , i majored in forreign languages in university .after graduating from university , i went to adult education graduate institute in national taiwan normal university in taiwan .now i am a junior high school teacher .in the daytime , i teach teenage students english .at night , i teach adults mandarin and english .i think what i learned in university and what i learn in graduate school help me to teach the teenagers and the adults .it makes me feel that teaching is meaningful and happy .to sum up , i definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it can broaden scope .in addition , it provides people more chances to learn more things .
