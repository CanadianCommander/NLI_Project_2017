whether the amount of cars will be smaller in twenty years time is almsost unpredictable .the reason is that such matters highly depend on the political and socio-cultural mood of the time .the answer also shifts according to the part of the world one is talking about .the numbers of cars might fluctuate in completely different ways depending upon whether one is talking about developed or developing countries .this essay therefore take different turns depending on the different scenarios and countries that are being discusses and based on the knowledge of facts available today .i will now concentrate on the developed countries such as the united kingdom or the united states .within the next twenty years , or even within the next decade , it will be impossible to deny the strength of the arguments that the environmental lobby and personalities such as al gore have been putting forward .i believe it is slowly becoming clearer that the enromous amounts of greenhouse gasses found in the atmosphere are largely caused by human actions and will have potentially disastrous effects on the environment .i believe that there will come a time when cars will not run on petroleum anymore , but on alternative energy .that might not reduce the number of cars , but it will reduce the effect that cars have on the environment .another possibility , is that states will invest more in public transportation .if that were the case , the amount of cars might reduce by a good amount .the amount of cars in developing and thirld world countries such as most countries in africa , will hopefully and in my opinion be higher in twenty years time .it is my belief that a substantial car industry and a high amount of cars per family are indications of flourishing economies .the ratio of cars per family is much higher in developed countries than in developing ones .thus if thirld world coutnries manage to get a grip on their economy and safety , the number of cars are likely to raise .
