i do not agree the idea that it is bettr to have borad knowledg of many academic subjects to specialize in one specific subjects .i have tow reson of it : our job and interesting for people .first , specific skills are useful when people find their job .most of campanies want people who have them , because they can give the campany new idea or new skill .in fact , when we have interview test for enter some company , we need to apeel our unique points and differences from others .specific skills are provide for good work .second , to specialize in one specific subject is interesting for ourselves and for people around us , because people who have their specific subject know something that everyone do not know .they can choose only one subject what they want to study , moreover they can give everyone surprising , interest or notice .for example , my teacher was major in japanese history at university so he has specific knowledge of it .he often tells his students interesting story .we do not know most of them so we always be really amaized but his story is really interesting .in conclusion , it is good for us to have one specific subject in that we can get our job easily and we can give people around us amazing .if you have it , you are looked as a great peason
