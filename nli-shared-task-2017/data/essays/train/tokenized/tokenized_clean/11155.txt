some people think that most advertisements does nt make products seem much better than they really are because some people think the looking of products are more important then the quility of the products .however , in my opinion , i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are three following reason which can prove and give more example for my persanal opinion .the most importand reason i think is that advertisements know what comsumer thinking when comsumver are shopping .the outside of looking of products is most point people will think to buy the products .therefore the advertisements speand more time to design what kind of looking of better for prodcuts then the time which they are design inside of products .this points can help counpany to get more money because they dont have to spand too much time on inside of products design , and cumsumer feel interesting on products looing , so they buy it .producing inside of products easier then making the good design for outside looking is the second important reason which i have chosen to put here .i was doing a research paper which is about disguessing how many times people usually spend on designing a new car .the research shows me that design a new car engige should speed more then five years at lessest .because it has too many thing need to do for it , and sometime it has some techengle gap which is hard to cross .however , the outside looking is easier to do compare with design inside .therefore , most off time the products seem much better than they really are .third , people usually care about the inside quility after they bought it .the thing for people to deside buy or not usually is outside looking .so people will complain the products when they bough it .however , in this point the company give cumsuners  money alreay .
