i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i have bought many products so far , and i am going to have to buy many products in the future .in my opinion , there are many products which are different from my image .when we watch tv , we see many advertisements , and most products we see on tv are very attractive for us .companies which make products are in competitive situations everyday .they have to make better products than other companies .advertisements are very important for these companies to sell all products .therefore , these companies have to make attractive advertisements even though the product is explain about only good things .this is these companies  business .i usually decide to buy products when i see the advertisement .however , when i wnet to a store and saw the product , i sometimes thought that it was different from my image .finally , i gave up buying the product .it happens sometimes .therefore , products are not necessary same as the advertisements .when the products is not same as our images , it make us disappointed .therefore , i agree with this statement .most advertisements are made to attract people .of course , there are some products which are same as those of advertisements .in my opinion , we have to decide to buy products after we go to a store and see the products .moreover , we have to understand that it is not always same as our images .
