i thing the statement  young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities  is wrong and right .you have to look at all aspect this statement give us .on one hand existing enough people who do not interessting for communities .these people are in their own world and could only see their own problems .sure , you have to manage your own life first till you can help other peole but there are also people who have a good life and no problems and are not interesstest in social life .on the other side there are many young people , who are visiting old peole or doing other nice things .the problem nowadays is the politics .if the politics would not be as bad as it is in the moment , younger people would have their head free for other things like the communities .for example , the problem to get a job is a very difficult thing .many factory - owners want to have good workers who should not be silly .so the not intelligent persons are not getting a job .if you have no job you can not buy food or can not rent a appartment .when a young person has a problem like this , that he or she maybe has to sleep at the street , he/she can not look after the communities .sometimes also the problem exist that people want to help , but they can not because the social-houses are in a bad vioce .if that happens there is no use for the biggest help .so all in all you can see that for every statement you have to look at many aspects to get a result .but in the end i think the statement is right because young people have their own things they have to do and could not care about so much aspects in their town .and in the end you can see that every person is a little bit egoism .that is very dissapointing but the truth .
