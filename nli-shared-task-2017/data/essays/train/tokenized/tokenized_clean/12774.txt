it is quite an important question .i think it depends on the level of the studies .actually , if the student is a graduate student , it is quite different than if he is an undergraduate student .in one hand , a broad knowledge of various subjects is important to aquire a good culture .it allows the student to have interests in a lot of things .besides , if he does not know what he would like to do , it is a way for him , to hit various subjects upon , and why not , for what he will be passionate , or unless what he would do later .in the other hand , to specialize in one more specific subject would be better for a student who knows for what he is interested , and who wants complete his knowledge , i mean , who wants aquire a deep knowledge .this student could get bored by the others subjects .even though , i own up , it would be a way to allow him to find interest in other things .actually , as far i am concerned , i would rather praise for a progressive solution .and i think that it is what it happens in the universities .i mean , i suppose it is better to have a broad knowledge at first , in order to specialize in one specific subject after that .this is why i told about the undergraduate and the graduate students .an undergraduate student has a knowledge about various subject , unless a general knoledge , and when he become a graduate student , he can specialize .it seems logical .a graduate student needs the whole time to concentrate and stress his subject as better than he can .eventually we can also ask if the better was let the students choose .would it be possible imagine a personnal program which would match with the students plans ?
