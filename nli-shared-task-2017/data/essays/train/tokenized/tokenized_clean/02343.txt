should students pay more attention to understanding concepts and ideas rather than learning facts ?there has been much debate over this topic .i strongly agree with the view that it is important for students to learn and understand ideas and core concepts as compared to learning facts .this is because of several reasons .first , the understanding of ideas and concepts helps in innovation .if students have a good grasp of concepts then they can apply them effectively in different and new areas leading to innovation .on the other hand , factual knowledge is limited and is not extensible .the facts can only be cited out or reused but they can not be always extended for innovation .second , the factual knowledge is easier to obtain and there are several sources for it .a student may not even need to go to the best schools or may not need to work with best teachers to gain the fact based knowledge in a better way .a person who might have never attended a school may also know many facts .on the other hand , when students study at best schools then they can gain a lot more by understanding concepts and ideas from the teachers and professors as compared to focusing more on fact based learning .they can engage themselves in research work in order to understand and analyze the different concepts learnt from their course curriculum .third , facts are stated and it may not be always possible to verify them .students have a lot of potential to learn and indulge themselves more in digging deep into the ideas in order to verify them .if they focus more on the fact based knowledge then they will not use this potential .understaning of concepts and ideas makes them to explore more into their field of study and get more benefit out of the study .lastly , there is more possibility that the fact based knowledge coulb be lost if not refreshed after a period of time and the facts are also subject to change .on the other hand , the understanding of ideas and concepts is more logical in its approach and it is difficult to forget it because students learn them by understanding them through in depth analysis .although , arguments can be made for both the sides of this statement , i think there are more advantages for the students by understanding ideas and concepts as compared to the learning based on facts .
