avertisement is a topic involved with marketing , and marketing is about creating long term relationship with customers .before focusing in advertisements , a company has to create a marketing plan of how to reach the target market .if the marketing plan of a company is effective , the need for advertisement is not as big as the need of a company that has a bad marketing plan .why do i involve marketing with the purpose of advertisement ?well , because a problem is only solved when the roots of the problems are known .when a company has a good marketing plan , that company will not have trouble reaching their target market and obtaining profits .starbucks is a great example .this company developed an excellent marketing plan according to their values and their objectives .starbucks has reached all their objectives and without the need to use advertisement .they do not need to tell the people how good their product is because the people already know it .this example leads me to explain if i agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i do agree with the statement because advertisements will be used only if the product or service needs it .a commercial for example will make products and services look better than they really are because that product or service needs the consumer s attention .of course i only agree with the statement because at the beginning of it , it says `` most  .if the statement would not have that word , i would not agree at all .the reason i would disagree is because there are companies like macdonalds that do not need the advertisements to sell their products , but they use them because the competition is huge , and they need their consumers to confirm why they are the best .advertisements are only use to catch the consumers attention , but it does not mean that the product or service will be exactly as is shown .a person will only let himself believe everything he sees and hears if that person does not know why the advertisement exists in the first place .companies would do anything that is necessary in order to sell their product or service .in a few words , most companies would do anything to be successful and make profits .
