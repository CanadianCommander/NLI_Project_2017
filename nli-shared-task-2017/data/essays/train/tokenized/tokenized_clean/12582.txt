nowadays we can find lots of products in the market .in order to sell these products , there are also many advertisements .i do agree this this statement which says that most of advertisements make products seem much beter than they really are .first , for example when you see in television some products , it attracts you .then when you go shopping and you bring this product at home .but , when you taste it you are very disapointed because you do not feel like the person on the advertisment .you feel unhappy .it is true that sometimes i buy products that i have seen in advertisement .for example , last time i bought some yoghurts i saw in advertisement , and it was said that it is not too sweet .i do not tell you my dissatisfaction when i put one spoon fo this in my mouth .but it was too sweet !thus , the advertisment lies .secondly , some advertisements draw you attention because the picture you see is very pretty and attractive .so you decide to find this good you see and o the market where you can bring it .sometimes what you see do not correspond to what you have seen in the advertisement .i would like to state you one of my experience .i am not one of those who like to watch television but when i put it on and decide to see some program i look even advertisement .anyway , i saw a vaccum in advertisement and decided to go and see it .of course i intended to buy it .but i do not because it does not look like what i saw , however it was exactly the same product .to conclude , i would just want to you aware of the fact that often advertisements are not true .their aim is to make you buy thier products and to show attractive things .consequently , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
