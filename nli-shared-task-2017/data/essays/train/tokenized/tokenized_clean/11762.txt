i believe that this statement holds a great deal of truth .to be successful , we must get rid of our tunnel-visioned outlook on life , and open ourselves up to new challenges .i see success as a relative concept .upon achieving a goal , i may belive that i have succeeded , yet someone else may see my success as quite ordinary and dull .this is due to the fact that each and every individual sets their goals differently from one another .i can recall many moments in my life when i had the opportunity to try new things .unforunately , i can also recall moments when these opportunities were not taken .one of these distinct memories is of the track and field competition that was held annualy at my school .every year , my friend alexander and i participated in the same races because we were used to them .i would always come first in the long jump , and alexander would be first on the short-distancd sprints , since he suffered from asthma and could not take the longer-distanced races .year after year , the races were the same for me and alexander , and our triumphant victories over the other particpants seemed to become trite as the years passed .after the fourth year , it did not seem like a success to us .it lost its element of surprise and astonishement .when the fifth year came , i was sure we would participate in the same races , which by that time , seemed more boring to us that a four hour toefl exam .however , i was surprised to see alexander sign up for the one kilometer race .i asked him what would happen if his asthma kicked in .i will never forget his reply .`` the only way to succeed over my asthma ,  he said , `` is to challenge it with something new .that year , alexander did not come first on the race .yet he succeed .how , you may ask .he managed to come out victorious from his battle against his asthma , by trying something new and challenging .i ended up getting my fifth gold medal for the long run competition .now i urge you to ask yourself .did i succeed , or did alexander succeed ?
