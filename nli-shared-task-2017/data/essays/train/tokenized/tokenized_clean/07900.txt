advertising a product is an effective way for companies to increase their revenue by displaying their products or services in various ways ( tv commercials , posters , shows , etc . .. ) .it can be argued that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertisements will never show the disadvantages or problems with a product that is being displayed .the company of the specific product will only show the positive side of the picture , whereby they will exaggerate upon the advantages of the product .this is only natural , as they are trying to sell their product and in order to accomplish this , they need to catch the eye of the consumer .for example , advertisements or commercials of suvs are always over-the-top .they will show their suvs going on the worst possible terrains , showing how effective they are and they will always point out small details that make it `` the best in the world  or `` better than their rivals  .they also point out that their suv is the one for everyone .that may not be neccessarily true , as everybody has their own tastes and not everybody is forced to like the same thing .the specific advertisement i talked about will never show how reliable the suv is or what problems one can encounter compared with it s rivals .whenever a price is given of the product ( for example an suv ) , that price is usually the basic model or the minimum that wo nt get the consumer much .in other words , they are cheating in a way because a consumer who becomes interested in the suv will find out that for all the facilities the suv has in the advertisement , there will be a big increase in the money paid from the price given in the advertisement .the companies know how weak the consumer can be once a successful advertisement of a product is given and will therefore make the product look like it s the ultimate thing to have .their only aim is to make the consumer buy the product .they do not neccessarily care about what happens after the purchase , as the company has already benefited from the profit being made .all of the above supports my opinion on agreeing with the statement that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they actually are , as they do not give the consumer a clear idea of what the product is really like .
