yes , i agree with that in twenty years there will be less cars in use than are tody .there are many resones to hold this view just like air pollution will go out of control , no fuel to drive cars , no space on road for cars and finally new technology will develop new thing .firstly , human are useing more cars , so by more number of cars produces more air pollution .so such air pollution will goes out of control of human being .so at that position human can not live and that time he will not use cars .secondly , human also useing much more fuel now a days to drive cars .this approch of human being is not good and resourse of fuel will end at some time .so due to shortage of feul man can not use cars in future days .for example , my friend use his bike for shorter rich work , by that wrong approch feul is wasting and it is not good for future .thirdly , as years passes humen will find new faster or good option for cars .so by such new technology it will happen that cars will out dated in next few years .finally , as the number of cars are increasing but the place for drive or to park cars is constant .so in next few years there will not any place to drive cars on roads .for example , my friend s family is having three cars for three persons .so that number of cars they can not have place to park all cars in their plot .in short , by humen act pollution will increase and they will not use cars .also human being useing more feul and that will cause of non use cars .also their will not be any place to drive cars on road and new technology will give new option to man .so according to in next few years cars will not be used .
