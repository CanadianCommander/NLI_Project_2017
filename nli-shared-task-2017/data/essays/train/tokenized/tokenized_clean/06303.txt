personally , i agree to the following statement : it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .many students tend to only memorize the facts and formulas when they study for a test and do not try to go more in depth to understand the meaning behind it .however , memorization of facts only limits that person s knowledge .although to learn the facts of a particular lesson is very important , a student needs to realize the greater importance of fully understanding the ideas and the concepts .for example , when a student learns new formulas in his/her math class , usually he/she undergoes a process where the teacher explains how these formulas work .if the student is only taught to memorize the pythagorean theorem , he/she will be missing the important value about the theorem .it is after the teacher has fully explained on how pythagoras discovered his theory when the students are able to understand the value and the use of it .they also will able to understand the `` why  question .without the knowledge of why mathematicians use this formula , many of the students will not be able to distinguish when to use these formulas on a test or on a problem .this is not only a case in a math class .in many of the science books , students are taught vast amounts of scientific facts such as friction , gravity , and light .however , to fully understand what these facts mean , they must understand the concept of it .it is best for the student to understand why friction occurs and how it happens rather than learning what is is .by learning facts , the students can learn the concerte , objective portion of the subject .however , through ideas and concepts , they are able to further learn about other possible solutions and perspectives .when a student fully understands the knowledge and the concept of it , he/she can use this new knowledge in other fields .for example , just memorizing the facts of sine , cosine , and tangent formulas does not help the student to answer some of the physics questions about angles of light incident and refraction .learning the facts only give shallow knowledges .when the students understand the ideas and concepts on how scientists and researchers came up with the facts , it means that they are truly learning .
