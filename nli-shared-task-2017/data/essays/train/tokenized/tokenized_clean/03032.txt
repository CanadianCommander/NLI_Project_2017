most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .this is extremely true in our modern day because the competition in the market is so high that businesses are willing to do anything to sell their products .i agree with this statement because i personally have bought many things based on their advertisements but was shocked later on by what i bought .this is a successful way to make the consumer loose trust in the producing company because when cheat and deceit come into the issue there is no way a person can depend on the seller .the market is full of other options so the buyer is not limited to this specific place especially after being treated unrespectfully .i , personally , have an issue with trust and when i put my trust into something i expect to get what i ask for with honesty and purity .as soon as i realize that i have been tricked then that is the last time i buy anything from that place .i do not think that i am the only one that thinks this way because if someone is willing to put their money into something than this thing better be worth it .whenever money is involved the topic becomes more sensitive because money is something that people work hard to try to earn and they will never just blow it away on something useless , unless they have a lot of it , then thats a different story .on the other side , though , the purpose of advertising anything is to make it more appealing to the people and by giving it a little `` push  of superiority makes it attract more people .so you ca nt really take it against them because that is their goal .although there is a difference between tricking someone into something and convincing them that this is the best product .if a person is deceived into buying something than he is nt very happy especially if this thing was not really worth its price .but if a person has satisfaction from what he bought because he was convinced and appealed by it then he will not realize any defaults in the product because of his over joy with it .this issue can be argued in two different perspectives and i do nt nessecarily think that any of these two points are wrong because they are both legitimate .my stand on this issue is that i do nt mind being convinced into something but i would never tolerate being tricked into it .faking something and misleading someone is the worst thing to me and i seriously would never put up with it .
