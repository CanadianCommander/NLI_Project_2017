success in the lifethere is no one in the world who doesnt want to be successful .in the school in the work eveybody struggle for doing his or her best .but what is the best and how is it obtainedaccording to me the mean of successful people is that doing its best without so much ambitious .but having some special success requires taking risk .the more risk brings the more success .of course not every time but generally this statement is true .doing always same things and waiting or watching the other ones doesnt make to earn much thing .for instance you are a reserach asistant worked in a laboratory and you are allowed to do some experiments which are interested your studies .your super visior is waiting from you discover some thing which isnt say before .if you just do the same things before which are done because of taking for you guarantee you can be stay in a situation being a research asistan years and years .since science and technology requires invention you have to study a lot you have to take some risks .in some chance plays also show that without tahing any risk the money is far from you .we all know some people are very full of good luck but chance is also limited .in this case study a lot in our area and taking some risk teach us new things .consequently taking risk is necessary in todays world more quality requires some risks but may be sometimes this risks results can be hurt us but all of us known this no pain no gain .
