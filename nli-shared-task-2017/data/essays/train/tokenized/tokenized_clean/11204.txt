when i was lazy student , i always tried to make out why did my teacher be insist to teach this ideas and concepts .now i grow up and get the main idea step by step .concepts and ideas must be learned clearly to predict the facts .first of all i totaly agree with this situtation .not being understand ideas and concepts and then predict or learn facts mean want to run not being learned how to walk .for example there are two students in same class .they are good friends in there .student a try to understand basic things and after all the notion .he wants to be the top in class .but student b just try to understand cause and effect .his intend is get enough marks in class .do you ever think why do teachers try to teach notions .i did , the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger .i mean their intends are not just students get the highest marks .when student learn ideas , concepts etc. he/she can do develop that subject .he/she really be the competent of this subject .in addition , student who wants to be an engineer , he/she has to learn all about the subject if s/he really create a unique thing or innovations .to sum up , you have to make our way between these student a and b. which one do you want to be ?just get enough marks on exam , make your gdp 2.01 and go to and ordinary college or be the top student in class , make your gdp 3.0 and go to harvard university .i would prefer the second one cause i want to be top .
