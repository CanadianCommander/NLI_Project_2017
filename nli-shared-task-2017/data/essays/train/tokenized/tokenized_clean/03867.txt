for beginning this essay , i just want to ask a question .if you win with a game 100 dollars , you will be happy , it s obvious .now , if with a game , you win first of all 200 dollars , and afterward in the same game you lost 100 dollars , eventually you will win 100 dollars , but will your feeling be the same in the two cases ?the really thing which is very important , is not a situation at an precise moment , but the evolution which lead us to a situation .thus , even if we are in a very good situation ( in work , family or friends ) , and this situation stays like that for a long time , our feeling will not be the same , because at the beginning there is a changement which do that we are happy , but after there is not thing which influency our life , so we take the thing differently .for example , we can quote , richard branson , who has a successful life , but he tries new things all the time , like diversify it company ( virgin ) , or things more crazy like do a turn around the earth in balloon , travel in the space ( not yet do , but maybe soon ) .by all means , there is also people who prefer do nt take risks and stay in the same situation .i think that there is not many people in this case , because if there is not evolution in our life , it become boring .obviously , there is some situation exceptional where it is not right .for instance , i do nt think that michael schumarrer ( ex f1 pilot ) was bored by the fact that each year during five years he won the championship .but it is a special case .for me , the most important in the life is the evolution , to come back to my introduction , obsviously i think that we are not in the same feeling in the two cases ( besides , some studies show that it is right ) .so , i agree that people ( not only successful people , but in particular ) try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
