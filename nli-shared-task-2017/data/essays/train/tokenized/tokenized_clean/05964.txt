the future of the automobile is today an uncertain one .car ownership has been raising in the last decades .but at the same time , the cost of that ownership and the environment consequences of running an automobile have been on the rise too .it is my opinion , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .firstly , the pollution consequences on environment due to the multiplication of cars have been observed more and more over the past years .for instance , this multiplication has had a great effect on global warming .these consequences have motivated the governments of several countries to take action by adoption tougher legislations on cars  emissions .for example , the government and congress of california adopted tough laws to make sure that the automobile manufacturers would respect the state s environmental laws .at the same time , many countries have ratify the kyoto protocol which deals with the issue of global warming .most of these countries have adopted legislations concerning cars that would meat accordingly with the kyoto protocol .but , if this does not respond to the problem of global warming , governments might legislate so that car ownership is reduce to one per household .adoption of public transportation politics by government like tax reductions might incitate the general population to use more the public means of transportation such as the subway , the bus or the tramways .those politics might reduce the number of cars .secondly , the cost of running a car has risen drastically in the course of the past years due mainly to high gas prices .it has come to a certain point that a lot of people have decided not to use their car to go to work and use instead the public transportation facilities .their automobile sits at home while not being used .if it is in the city , this excessive parking time might cost a fortune to the car s owner .undoubtedly , this car s owner will not buy another automobile after this one .and if this scenario is repeated for other people than it will see a general reduction of the world s car ownership .in conclusion , the high environment cost of using the automobile and the raising prices to its ownership are factors that will create a reduction in world s car ownership .
