i disagree with the statement .i think it is more intereting to travel alone or by a relatively small size of the group without a tour guide .there are two main reasons to support my idea .first , it is true that to have a tour guide with us are better for the instructions about the sight-seeing place .however , i prefer to look up into the guide books by myself and imagine how to travel by my own way .when i traveled kenya alone , it was really alone and little bit scarely .i have to speak by myself , look into the book , and communicate by my self .to tell the truth , that was the most exciting experience that i ever had when travelling .because i was alone , i really feel everything from bottom of my heart , and had a peaceful mind to think of many things freely .secondly , if there are friends or the people around me , that is fun only with that situation as i can talk a lot with such a people .however , i will loose my tentions to see carefully around myself .also , if the tour guide explaine about the places in detail , i will become more passive to the situation .how can i remember these sights from heart ?it is doutful .furthermore , i do not want to travel in a noisy large group with only japanese .i can share my pleasure for sure , but may annoyed by some noisy , impolite people .that is the worst thing .for these reasons , i prefer to travel individually with making intereting plans and see whatever i want to talking with not only friends but also the local peoples a lot .that will sure to make the voyage intereting and effe
