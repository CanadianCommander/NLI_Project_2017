i disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of two reasons .here are my reasons .firs , if one person does nt want to give his enough time to help other people that means he is selffish .i jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company .in my opinion , if there are two people at the siminar work position .the better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people .the god always helps the one who loves help other people .the one who loves pay more time to help people .he will get the feedback of others .you never know when will other people feedback your help .once i worked in a local campany , but i always help people and do some volunteer works on patient group .till i want to work at a global company .some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company .give enough time to helping communtites not only gives me peace , lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world .second , i can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger .this big gap brings some public security problems .the rich person affrid to be hostage , the poor people do nt have money to give their child well education .why do nt we give enough time to helping our communities ?give the poor person help to educate , get work and resept .we will not have much more public problem .moreover we will feel happy and lovely .according these two reasons , i disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping communities .young people are like sponge .what you teach them what you earn .moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other communities .give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to makes our world better and lovely .
