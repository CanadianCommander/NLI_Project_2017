this is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education .indeed , the task of education is to teach students a lot of theories , ideas and concepts .that s also why we learn philosophie in school , to learn to doubt , to think and analize .the follow quotation of montaigne shows the real question : `` it is better to have a well established brain that a full brain .but both ca nt work separately : we need comon knowledge to learn how to take a decision and how to behave in society .history shows us the way to behave with other countries , mathematic shows us how to deal with other countries , geography teaches us how to reach other countries and languages allow us to speak in other countries .the comon knowledge represents all ideas , concepts and theories we need to make the right decision and understand our environement .despite all of this , one day , students have to use their knowledge in a practical field to experience the profit of it .the increasing rate of internship demonstrates this need of ` facts  .education requires always more from students without teaching them the real work they are attending for .that s why , there are more and more private schools that offer a practical schooling with a long period of internship .university realized this problem few years ago and tried to adapt themself to the reality of the market .to conclude , i would say that this is a central question in education field .in my point of view both are as important .the question is no longer to know if we should teach ideas and concepts but more to know where is the border between ideas , concepts and practical facts ?
