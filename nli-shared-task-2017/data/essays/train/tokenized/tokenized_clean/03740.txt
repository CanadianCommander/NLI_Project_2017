i do nt think that yong people do not take care of their communities .there are three reasons to support my oppinon .when i was 16 years old i was in the school valunteer s club in an year .at that time , i could realize that there are a lot of people who help me without thinking of money .also i could understand why there are communities in the world .i think there are so much chancese to take that kind of experience for young student in korea .listening radio is one of my hobby and my favorit program is  chin han chin gu  that means my best friend in english and most of listeners are middle or highschool students .whenever i listened that radio program , i could heard about a moved story about our life .the mc of that program always tel the meaning of peace through the radio and that really helps me to do good things .an year ago  www.thehungersite.com  is produced through that program and i m not sure but over hundred thousands students can heard about that same as me .in that site , you can do a nice thing to hungerd children without money problem .even young peaple do nt help their society , that s not only young people i think .we live in a big city and there are not enough communication between our neigberhoods .i think that s the point why the people think they live in a cold-society .in that reasons , i do nt agree with that young people do nt help their communities .
