today , we go to vacations to various places such as italy , france , or switzerland .when going on a vacation , some people prefer being in a group of tourists led by a tour guide .however , in my opinion , i believe that the best way of traveling is traveling individually without a tour guide for these two reasons .first of all , traveling with a tour guide is too limited in time .for instance , even if you want see something leisurally , you would be cut off on time and have to assemble to a certain place the tour guide wants you to .you would nt be able to spend lots of time as you want buying postcards in shopping areas or have time watching street performances .i believe a trip will be more enjoyable when spending time leisurally with your family or friends , so i think getting limited on time is nt a good choice to make .also , following the tour guide in your trip will make you feel uncomfortable and also may cause some bad interactions with the tour guide .for example , if you are tired or want to see some other parts of the country such as beautiful scenaries , or places where a famous movie was taken , you wo nt be allowed to go there because you have to move as a group through out your trip .once when i was on a trip to austria , there was a suggestion of visiting the house in the movie , `` sound of music  by the majority of tourists , but it was not taken by the tour guide .so that day ended up in having misunderstandings and negative feelings toward the guide .in conclusion , i think the best way of traveling is traveling without a tour guide , but rather traveling by your own will .following the guide all day , weeks , or months will be too limited in time and make you feel uncomfortale .therefore , i believe that traveling individually will be more fun and will allow you to have more chances of looking around places and being free .
