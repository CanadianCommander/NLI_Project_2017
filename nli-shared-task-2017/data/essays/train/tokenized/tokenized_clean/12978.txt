people have different opinions on whether having general knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .people who diagree the statment argue that specific knowlege is useful to get a better jobs .however , i agree the topic for two reasons : capability and social relationship .i will explain these reasons in detail .to begin with , broad knowledge is capability which has one of the facters in modern society .nowadays society wants people who have diverse ability .also , many university offers various curriculum to students .for example , my sister has many ability such as english ability and resources of economy , policy and art .so when she meet people , almost all people like my sister .in one day , she went to bankd to exchage his dollar .hence , she saw some foreigner .so she asked some thing to happen and the man answerd that he did not find their company , therefore , she talked him and solved the problem , after that , she got some request to get a job .this means that ability is useful for living society .second , it is good for sustaining social relationship .people want to make relationship with brilliant person .moreover , they need to obtain to get good qualification .besides , many private institute to learn creat in our society .among them , the language courses as an good example .in my university , kookmin university , has many courses for language such as chinese , japanes and english .consequetly , many people concentrate on the courese .therefore , the courses is finished to enroll .also , my uninversity offers conversation courese to students .it means that it is useful for student .in conclusion , i support that information of many academic subject is better than professional subject for the following reasons .first , it is ability which modern people should have .second , it is eligible for keeping social relationship .
