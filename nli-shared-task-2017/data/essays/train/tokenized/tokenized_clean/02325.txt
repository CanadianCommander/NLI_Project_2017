i think it is both important , to learn ideas and concepts as well as facts .but as more valuable i would consider the learning of ideas and concepts .learning facts is very usefull if you want to attend a quiz show or if you take a test to be admittet at a college or university .these test often just ask questions on facts , but people like me are not able to keep these facts .if i just learned facts in school , i would be pretty stupid , because i am not able to keep it , i just forget it again .i do not mean to it but i just can not help it .wheread if i leraned concepts and ideas i would know much more .facts are less important .if you remember facts you do not have a conection to other topics , for example if you learn that the world war ended in 1945 what does it tell you ?not much , only that it enden in 1945 , but if you learn what causes the war to end and what happend after the war you learn much more .you can make connections to other countries , for example what happend there after the end of the war .you would be able to relate these effects of the war to other wars and draw conclusions from it .if a new war starts you may be able to tell what happends when it ends again , just because you learned these concepts in school .but like i said above it is also important to know some facts .everybody should know when the world war begann and ended , but it just should not be paid so much attention to it .especially these admiting test should give more importance to the ability of drawing conclusions from an event than recalling the fact of it .to come to a conclusion i would say it is more important to learn ideas and concepts rather than facts , they should just be supportive .
