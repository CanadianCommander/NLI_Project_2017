when i was a graduate school student , some undergraduated student asked that it was good for him to go to graduate school or not .at that time i answered that out society requires specialized people , so you should go to graduate school .first of all , most of companies and schools like specialist .for example , i joined this company for my special ability about computing special algorithm and hardware information .but my manager said to me that the reason why i was accepted was my special ability to develop new programs .and so on i had favoralbe characteristics about developing programs .in my opinion the special characteristics is also personal special ability .secondly , specializing evokes evolution .for instance a lot of professors and scientists had a lot of theories after they consumed their own whole life at their taeget or result .my professor spended his whole time to modeling about electrochemical etching and finite element method .now he is very famous at modeling and he wrote some books about revised his theory and method .and my father was a engineer in mechanics .he spended his whole time to make a new machine to make a speical register .he made finally that machine and he got a lot of momey .i heard that most recruiters wanted various experienced students or engineers .however , i want to say that special ability is the prerequisite or premis to get a new job .my friends did not have their jobs after graduation .so they tried their special ability about learning foreign language , special engineering course work , and how to introduce themselves to recruiters .after those courses which took two or three months , they had their job successfully .in conclusion , special knowledge is more important that broad knowledge in modern society .because our society requires specialist , and specialists can make a lot of money in future .so most of students will try to be a specialists .
