i definitely do agree with the statement because of several reasons .firstly and most important , i suppose that learning just facts without understanding the idea or the concept behind , you do not have the context and the basis to keep single facts in mind for a long time .in addition , knowing the ideas and concepts always enables you to learn the facts later , for example when you need them .in generel , people do remember what they once unterstood but do forget what they just learned without understanding it .on the other hand , it is sometimes easier for students to learn the facts , because they get easier and faster access to reading material and books than to lectures and learning events which might better explain the ideas and concept .in the short term , it might also appear more effective to learn just the facts in order to get a proper preparation for tests , because it is often more efficient when tests just ask for the facts .but in the long term , as i already said , it is much more effectiv to understand the concept which serves you as a valuable basis to put related knowlegde on .therefore , proffessors , ought to attract students to attend the learnig events in order to get an overwiev of the topic and understanding the concept and backround .from my own experience i know that i do not remember any facts of subjets , of which i did not understand the concept .but in case i understood the idea and the context , i know where my notes are to get the demanded facts quickly .overall it becomes very clear that in the middle - and lorg term , understanding the concepts and ideas of a subject in order to learn effectively and keep things in mind , is much more effective than just learning the facts .
