how many times your teacher has told you that it was very important that you understood every thing you study in class .i do nt know you but for me it s imposible to remember .you can inferd after my introduction that i m completly agree with the statement , and during the next lines i ll try to give you reasons to explain the opinio mentioned above .when you are student your only objectivealong all the course is to pass the exams , to get good qualifications and to spend the best holydays without studying so you do nt study to learn and to knowhowever , when you finish your studies and you start the work life all your priorities change and you start to remind your teachers words .in spite of the fact that this year , it s my third year working in the same company and my fourth year since i finished my degree , i continue thinking about the first day manager asked to my a question about one account subject .that situation was ambarrased beacause , although my office mate try to help me , i could nt remember anything about the material even though i can remember the book where the information was .moreover , not all the situations are completely the same , but they are similars and it s posible that if all the concepts are understood you could use in many situations .the most adventage of understanding the things you learn or the concepts you use in work is that after you can explain all the cirtustances related to that thing .this is very important when you are working and you need to report yor manager .in conclusion , you never know when you are going to need and use the things you learn and if you know how to use the information you can use it whenever you want .
