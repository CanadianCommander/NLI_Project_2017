in ordinary life , we often have to face delimmatic choices , just as the statement gives rise to a debate over whether the understanding of ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .some people assert that understanding ideas and concerpts are more important for students , while other people believe that learning facts is more benefit to students .as a matter of fact , this issue is a complex and a controversial one .different person will have their different choice due to their distinct background .in my opinion , there is not a universial answer to this question , and which choce takes precedence may quite depend on the specific situation .the final decision , nevertheless , should rely on a case - by-case analysis .as far as i am concenrned , however , i agree that learning facts is more important .i would like to provide evidences and gives reasons to suport my choice .the first argument that can be presented to support my option is that real knowledge comes for practice .i can think that there is not a better example of the idea than the obvious fact that learning swimming must make practice .only understand idea and concepts can not grasp swimming .to illustrate , that chemical experiments make students to learn chemistry knoweledges more better .although that real skill comes from learning facts is an imporant aspect , it is not the only explanation for me to choose the statement that learning facts is more useful .the increased value places on the idea that facts are the deep understanding to the ideas and concepts .in addition , according to my personality and experience , as well as common sense , i believe that learning facts is a better choice for students .to be sure , it may be true that understanding ideas and concepts are useful in some condictions .however , this is not fufficient to support to claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is too weak to strengthen the argument .in cloclusion , based on the above mentioned reasons , which sometimes correlate with each other to make part of a larger unit , thus become more convincing than each single one of them .so we can firmly to say learning facts is more important .
