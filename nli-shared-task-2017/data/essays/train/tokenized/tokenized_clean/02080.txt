if everyone had a car in this world there will be no place for us to live in .i will agree with the statement .the world is making it harder for everyone to get a car or even own one .the improved public transport is another alternitave for transportaion .those are some signs cars are going down .the cars now are very expensive to buy one .a middle income peoson will have to pay more than half his income to get a car .the expenses wont stop there you will have to pay also for the gas .the maintance of it .even to park your car you will have to pay for it .anothr hassling problem is the traffic on the roads and no one is doing anything about it .in a couple of years i think very few people will afforad to buy gas since they oil prics are going up so fast .some good signs that the cars will go away .first you have the improved public transport , trains , metros , and buses .which will cover up the need for peoples transportation .since almost eveyone lives in a city and everything is close togther .also another thing that has a signs car will go away is all these anti pollution groups and the hard reglations in some countries regarding the emssions .in conclusion , it wil be nice if the number of cars go down .that will mean less cars accidents and less injuired or dead people from reckless drivers .the will be a little cleaner not that much becase of the other factories .with all the technology going around us and the good public transport .i would say there is a very big chance the number of cars will go down dramctilly .
