from my own experience , i will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reasons such as money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom .people usually say that money can not buy happiness , but i say that money can certanly helps a lot .older people usually have paying jobs that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easily obtain .one can use money to buy tickets to music concerts , to go to expensive restaurants or even to travel all around the world .these activities enhance the experience of life .time is another good reasong why old people enjoy life more than young people , because when young , someone has activities that can not be avoided .for example , a kid can not choose to go or not to go to school , the parents do .time is an asset that only old people have lots of .older people can engage in activities such as art , traveling , cooking and studing because they do not depend of a school or work schedule to live their live by .old people also have more experience , a quality that i personally believe that increases the possibilities to enjoy life .for example , if a young man travels to paris , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspective of an old man .the young man will probably see only an old city full of old bouilding and museums , but under the experiences eyes of an old man , paris is full of art , culture and history .the old man will enjoy more the trip beacuse his years of experience .finally , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older people enjoy life more than others , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decisions in life , this will contribute to a more rich life experience .
