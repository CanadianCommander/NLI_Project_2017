some people say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing whar they already know how to do well while other people disagree .in my opinion , however , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks because new things can stronly appeal to people , they are different from other things , and it is hard to be on the top with the same things .firstly , it is generally agreed that new things can strongly appeal to people .when a computer was firstly invented , people extremly got excited about the new convenient machine .now most of people have at least one computer in their house .actually , the invention of computer was a sensation for the last century and also a good example of a new stuff that brought the success to the inventor .secondly , they are different from other things .when a thing is different from all others , it gets its own speciality .this might get extremly possitive effects or extremly negative effects .however , it is worth to challenge for the great success .normally , successful people try to make or do new things while taking amount of ricks .lastly , it is very hard to be on top with same things because there are already a bunch of same things in the world .it is very hard to win in the market with same stuff with others .as time goes , people starts to look for something new and fresh .to sum up , it seems clear that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already how to do well with three reasons stated above .in order to be a successful person , they always try to make or do new things firstly rather than other people .
