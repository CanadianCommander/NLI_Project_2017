the statement is certainly true .products  qualities are exaggerated by advertisements .as there is no empirical support available , i will support this position twofold .first , i will give two short examples of such advertisements .second , i will discuss possible explanations of the phenomenon .if there are both fitting cases and a compelling theory , we have the best evidence availiable without further study .finally , i will briefly discuss possible actions .the first example relates to a typical car spot .the cars are almost always polished to brilliance , the only exception being spots on jeeps , hummers and the like .but these types of car are designed for use in wilderness .suv ( meaning sports utility vehicle ) is ironically referred to as a ` suburban utility vehicle  .the spots pretend a reality that does not exist .also , often the windows of the cars are made of black glass .i suppose this stresses the geometric features of the cars and lets it appear a bit mystique .summed up , the cars are always in perfect shape and not in the state of your average car .using small and smart tricks , the spots manipulate the expectations and the image you might have of the car .another example is a recent advertisement for milk that i saw .in the morning , the whole family sat together around a nice table in a beautiful kitchen .the sun was shining , and everybody was havong fun and drinking milk .this scenario probably is a bit overstretched and not corresponding to the average breakfast .it was suggested that milk and the enjoyable situation are linked together .after these two short examples , we proceed to possible explanations .a set of them is located in the dynamics of the competition on the market .firms , if they are to survive , are forced to sell their goods .to this end , they try to compel the comsumer to buy the company s product , and not the competitor s .therefore , firms make their goods appear as good as possible .advertisements not only serve to immediately selling products - they also increase the prestige of the company s brand .a well-known name allows a company to take higher prices for its products , for consumers base their decisions upon incomplete information about the products .they assume that a well-known brand also means well-established quality , which would justify higher prices .also , game theory helps a bit in explaining the phenomenon .a company can not be sure that the competitor s advertisements are true .so the company may be tempted to cheat a little to boost its sales in a presumably unfair competition .in political science , this constellation is known as prisoner s dilemma .regarding possible solutions , the eu has some regulations on advertisements that do not exist in the united states .in the eu , companies are not allowed to include information about the product they know to be wrong .also , the eu has stricter guidelines on ingredients in foods and their publication .apparently , there might be some room to manouevre in the legislative area to tackle the problem .on the other hand , an informed consumer judging on the basis of the best knowledge will be the best weapon against these kinds of misleading advertisements .
