young people could be the most encouraged members of a community but not all are the same kind of person .i grew up in a small town with approximately 36000 inhabitants .i attended a youth club that was leaded by the church .we did a lot of things for our community .first , we meet to discuss problems in our city .every wendsday there is a discussing round about current problems , e.g. about vandalism in our old town .moreover we organize parties and events where we collecte money for different programs to help other people .it is a very good feeling to have fun on a party and at the same time helping others .we also make trips to help underpreviledged people to renew their houses .these are some examples of our community work and i hope that they show why i am disagreeing with the statement .but i also know that such a community work is not generell .i think especially in big cities it is a great problem that young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities .but i think this is quite normal .they are not as closely connected to their community as i am .i suppose that they even do not have the chance to be directly involved .there are to many problems in big cities that hardly can be solved by youth .but i also believe that many young people are not interested in their community because they only think about their own wishes and problems .they are not able to connect these two things .i mean own problems and community problems .i think they often stand closely together .i would summarize that this is a difficult problem which is not easy to solve but i think that not all young people are lazy like it is maintained from many adults .youth clubseventshelp elder people
