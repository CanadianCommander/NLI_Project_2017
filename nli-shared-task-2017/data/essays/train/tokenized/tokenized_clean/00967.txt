i disagree wit the statement .i do not think there will be fewer cars than now at least in twenty years .i would say that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in fifty years .now the earth is getting warm , which does not effect in good way for neither creatures including human beings nor plants , for instance , forests .this thing called gloval warming are considered that it will melt graciers around polar regions .it causes the increasing of the surface of the sea .many people would have to move to somewhere higher altitude .also the warming would cause skin cancers .because of really strong x-lay .some people even these days have possibilities to get skin cancer , but if it gets much hotter and stronger x-lay more people would get it .one of the methods to solve the problem or alleviate the matter , we should decrease the emittion of carbon dioxide from gases of cars .people are actually trying to do that , but it is really hard to make it in a couple of decades .first of all , people in all of the world need to pay attention and focus on doing that .i do not think everyone would pay attention about it till it becomes obvious that the earth faces to real danger .moerover , not all people , but also all countries , government need to work on it with citizens .then they need to work on it together .there is another reason that i disagree with the statement .many more kinds of cars are invented and made recently such as cars with new functions .if producters keep creating cars , the numbers of cars would not be changed .i think it would rather increase the numbers of cars .more new technologies such as cars we have , more problems we have in the future .decreasing numbers of cars is pretty hard so that i do not agree with the statement .
