i do not agree with the fact that `` young people enjoy more life than older people do  .first of all , as a young person myself , i can state that we experience a lot of stress during our teenages .we have to make all the choices on which will depend our future , therefore we do not have time to fool around and enjoy life .from the age of five until the age of twenty , approximatively as it depends on the country we study in , we spend our time learning , studying , thinking of our future and it does not leave a lot of time to enjoy much of what life is .secondly , when we get older , we have seen and experienced so much , that when the time for retirement comes , our head is full of ideas of what we want to do or what we want to see .and the major fact is that old people have time to do what they want , moreover the life time have so much increased that nowadays when people retire , they have a full twenty years ahead of them in france .in other countries , it might not be the same ; for example , in the united - state , executives retire after the age of sixty-five .so , old people have more time to enjoy life than young people do .moreover , it is a common knowledge that as we get old we tend to be a child again .so much old people discover themselves new passions as sight-seeing .for example , once i was at the opera and the old woman sitting next to me told me that going at the opera or to the theater were her new passions since she was retired .she also told me that before , it would have never occured her that she would become passionate by it .futhermore , how much old people do we see sight-seeing or in the museums comparatively to young people ?to conclude , old people enjoy more life than young people though the quotation `` carpe diem  .
