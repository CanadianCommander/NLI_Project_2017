i agree with the statement that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are .as a matter of fact , i believe that this is precisely the whole purpose of advertising : convincing potential consumers of the good qualities or advantages of a specific product or item .it is the ultimate goal that the consumer , buyer , or customer does what is being recommended in the ad .unfortunately , people in advertisement business may use all sort of techniques to sound convincing and be effective , which goes from mentioning only good qualities - and exclude those which are not so good - to emphasizing the bad qualities of alternative products or services .for example , any shampoo advertisement will claim that it will make hair get shinier , glossier , and easy to handle in , probably `` no time  .is it true ?if we carried out a research to classify hair products ( just to choose any product ) into those which are effective and those which are not , we would probably end up with a ration of 1 to 9 .for one effective shampoo , there are 9 which `` claim  to be but they are not .as consumers , advertisements have made us less gullible and more alert , as well as more careful when we make decisions on the basis of impressions created by advertisements .by making a comparison , advertisements are similar to the reflection on a rear-view mirror , reason why a sticker reads `` objects in rear view mirror are closer than they appear  .we need to widen the use of this statement to many other contexts .i personally think that , although there are regulations to control the advertising business in terms of using true/untrue statements and claiming results that they do nt actually deliver and sometimes even cause others , there is a strong need for further more-detailed regulations regarding the use of misleading techniques which make consumers make wrong decisions .consumers should be better protected because most advertisements use questionable technoques which manipulate the truth and that is dishonesty ..
