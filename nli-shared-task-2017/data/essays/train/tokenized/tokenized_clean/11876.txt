i completely agree with the statement -  young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the reasons for my view are lack of ethics , lack of seriousness and lack of time .my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs .firstly , the young people lack ethics .what i mean to say is that the youth no longer respets the concepts like helping nature , modesty and empathy .the youth has become selfish i.e. , young people always think about themselves and no longer cares for the people who are in need of help .many friends of mine keep going for movies and parties , very frequently .their expenditure comes to around 1000 rupees a month , only for enjoyment .what i would like to say is that these people can help the community with money or by devoting some time but they dont .the reason for this might be lack of responsibility towards community or may be they were not tought about these things .secondly , many of the young ones are in the mind set - what does i get by helping the community ??my neighbour who is quite young and rich ( earning a slary of 40000 rupees per month has never donated a single penny .rather he spends the money on pubs , buying a new car , etc .thirdly , few youngsters think that since they had gone through a tough time in their life , they try saving everything - not spending either for the community nor for themselves .also , few of them dont get the time of their busy shedule in order to spare some time for the community .lastly , many of the young people dont really understand the problems of the community i.e. , they lack empathy .i would like to conclude by saying that there are young people who help the community but are very few .in order to improve the situation , the young people have to be tought about the need to help the community so that every one is happy and also the contry prospers .
