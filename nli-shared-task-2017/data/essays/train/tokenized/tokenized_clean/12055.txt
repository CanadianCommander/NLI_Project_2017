mostly there is two kinds of people .one is trying to do new things and takes risks .on the othere hand , people like to do only thing they know it before without takeing any risky things .each kind of these people have their reasons .i will discuss more about them in this assay .first of all , people who like to do new things and to involve in risky things , i will call it a `` risky man  .this man have the feel of challenge .there fore , he likes to do arisky and strainge things and he enjoy it .for instance , a man who like to claim mountains , sailing a round the world or , for more risky , swiming from country to others .why do the risky man do this things ?propeply he want to grant a huge number of money and to be a famouse and unforgitable .further more , most of these people you can find them in ginnes record .secondly , people who like to do normal and ussual things , i can call them a `` calmy man  .this man like to live in peacfull and calm life .he prefer to have a happy family than making risky things .plus , he think that person who do a risky things is craizy .more over , this calmy man ussually have a job with loving partners .how ever , he rarely go on travils and trips .finally , i think being a risky man it is not good due to the risky situations that he faces during his life .also , being a calmy man is not good too .his life is very quite and boring .in my opion is that compining between the two personality is better .so then from time to another you can make little risky and new things like saling about or building a wooden house .more over , having a nice family with a good job .
