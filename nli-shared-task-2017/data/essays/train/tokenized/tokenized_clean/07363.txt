i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i disagree this because half knowledge is always harmful .the primary reason why i prefer specialization in one specific subject is specialization gives you indepth study of the subject which could be very useful in the real time applications .for example a computer engineer can not be an efficient cardiologist .this may effect the heart patient .another reason for specializing in one subjet is you can discover new things after going across insight information of the subject .most of the discoveries have been made by the scientists only after specializing in one subject .that is after conducting repeated experiments on one thing .thirdly , specialization improves creativity in a person .in every field specialization is the essential component .however it is better to have some knowledge of many academic subjects and that is why when you come from graduation to post graduation then to phd , you are supposed to take specialized subjects .therefore based on the specialization students are classified as computer engineers , electronic engineer , doctors and so on .in conclusion , i strongly recommend that specialization in one subject is better than having broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
