do you agree or not with the advertisements which make products seem much than they really are ? .there are some advertisements make prosucts that seem better and beautiful mucth than they are .but actiully they are not they are just try to trick you and to sells their products .they just make their products looke better , good and strong to trick you and let you buy it or even rent it .if you ask me about it , i really disagree and i will try to convinc you .why i desagree with it ? , i desagree because of several reasons , and i hope you to agree with my opinion .first of all , maybe you have to buy some products to your own market or your home , and some of theis products maybe are expensive beacause they are looke better and good , but when you use them for one year you will start to face some problems with those products because they are really not good .in addition on that , some customers or people will not trust this products anymore , because they always see the products better but they are really not .and thats make some people keep away from this products .and this will make some products be worest , and also this is the most important reason to let me disagree with itfinally , i will give an example on that , if i have my products and the people knew that my products just seem better but it is really not , they will left my products and they will buy another one .so i will lose my mony cause i lost the trust between my products and my customer , and this is important reason too .
