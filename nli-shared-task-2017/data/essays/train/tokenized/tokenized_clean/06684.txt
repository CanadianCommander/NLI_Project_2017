is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ?or is it better to specialize in one specific subject ?tricky questions .i would have to say that it depends , they both have their cons and pros .for example , when you re in high school , which is my case , you definitely should have knowledge of all the academic subjects that you need in order to graduate and pass on to your next step in life , which is college .but once you get to college , for example , why would you need to know advanced math when you do nt want to study anything related to it ?you would just be wasting your time and money .right now , i m required to know , at least a little , about everything , from ancient history to the meaning of the mathematical term pi .but sometimes i find myself asking : will i ever use this again in my life ?why should i learn all these things if i do nt want to study anything related to it ?but then there are some other times when , for example , my younger sister comes to me with a school problem and i can help her because i ve learned those things before .sometimes we can be very lazy and only learn what is presented to us at the moment .but then there are the times when we want to know everything .like for example , when we are kids , that everything our mothers do we question them why .why this and why that , and there never seems to be an answer to all of a our questions .going back to the questions , a pro of knowing about different subjects is that you actually know about pretty much anything .this makes it easier to have a conversation with another person and even to get a boyfriend .a con is that maybe you ve spend way too much time doing your research and when you realize it a part of your life has gone by .a pro of specializing in only one specific subjetc is that you can be better at what you do .a con is that you wo nt have so many things to talk about with someone outside of what you do .to summarize this entire thing , i definetely think that everyone should have knowledge of basic information and subjects and even read the newspaper , at least once in a while , and be educated , but have more knowledge on your field of study and that way you can be the best professional that you can be .
