the question has been asked whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for them to learn facts .in my opinion , understanding is definatly more important because it give the students a progress of exploring , a chance to be creative and an unforgetable result .trying to understand ideas and concepts of a topics alows students to go through the investing process .for example , telling students that literacy devices such as metaphor , similies and imagery make writings good is not really convincing .instead , it would be better to let the students explore through different types of literture and found out themselves that certain techniques add to the porfessioness of writing .understand how they work would give students a better lesson .getting the concepts and ideas also provides students a chance to be creative , especially when dealing with are .what kind of art class whould it be without studio work ?students should be offered to get creative with colours , textures , moods and all sorts of thing .who cares if they fail once in a while ?new creations found in the process of real understanding .years after years , it is not the defination that students remember , but the unforgetable experience that they learned .giving out the facts does not provide students a lot of thoughs of their own .by understanding the ideas and concepts , students gained the ability to conclude the facts themselves .even if they forget about the facts , they would be able to `` reproduce  them .facts is the devil that limited imagination and understanding .thomas edison woulding be able to invest without knowing the ideas and concepts of science very well .
