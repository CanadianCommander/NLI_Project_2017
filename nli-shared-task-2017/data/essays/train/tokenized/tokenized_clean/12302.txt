i agree that for students understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .a couple of examples drawn by my own experience convince me of this .in school , be it high school or university , students start familiarizing with a broad range of concepts that profoundly influence their ways of thinking and acting .concepts and ideas provide an individual of a young age with a framework for thinking and following a certain methodology .for instance , in an art course , a student familiar with the underlying concepts of cubism will be more able to draw inferences on other works of art of the same period than a student who has focused on the biographical data of an artist or on the names of his works .moreover , the student who master the values who are at the basis of cubism will be also able to relate them to similar currents of different fields , such as philosophy , literature , music .a student who has focused on pure facts could face some problems in linking up several facts if these belongs to different ` realms  .although it is important to have a good knowledge of examples of specific facts or event , it is indispensable to understand concepts and ideas as they provide a good methodology for analyzing and understanding the reality as it appears to us , especially when we have no prior background information to rely on .in a media class , understanding which tools are needed to analyze a certain radio show can be useful in the event we have to design the analysis for a totally new media product from scratch , such as a new internet-based application or an upcoming information technology .finally , although facts are part of the cultural ` baggage  everyone uses everyday , can be considered of secondary importance than concepts and ideas which provide the framework for thinking and acting .
