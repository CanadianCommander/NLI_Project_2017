although many people say that we will not use cars anymore in the future , yet cars are necessasy tools even in the future .namely .cars will still prevail .for this purpose , i do nt agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .here comes discussion .in the first place , cars are great inventions .there are a variety of them and they help us a lot ; for example , transportation - both humans and cargoes .besides , they save time .we benefit from cars very much .undeniably , convenient as cars contribute , we can not ignore the negaitve impact they make ; say , the exhaust and energy crsis .however , scientists are now trying to figure out some alternative solutions such as biodiesel .using biological sources , cars will not cause environmental problems .since new tecnology has been develpoping in a breathtaking speed , i am optimistic about the futhure .in my opinion , cars will exsit , maybe changing into another form , but they will always exsit .after all , we ca nt live in a world with cars .they are too important to be thrown away .there will be more and more cars in the following decades .advantages can turn out to be malign while misfortune to be a blessing .in brief , however , we should not abandon cars , not only because they symboize the milestone of human history but also because they are practical , even in the future .
