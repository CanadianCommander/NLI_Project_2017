though i agrees with the notion that specializing on a specific subject have more potential for contribution to knowledge as a whole , but i also thinks that confining to a specific line of discipline may leads to missing of understanding of how everything fits together .there are other points which leads to my standpoint .we live in an information age in which we have access to a sea of data .furthermore , each subject area in itself has lots of academic literature about the knowlege accumulated throughout the ages in it .only ff a person confine to a specialzed field and narrow down the point of focus , innovative research is possible .it may appear that in an attempt to gain wider knowledge , the student can just study what is available without getting any chance to contribute to it .though this is true , we should not miss the point that by understanding the context and knowing how things work together can only takes one to a position that can lead him to actually contribute to the field .historically , many of our researcher have contributed to a large variety of scientific discipline and proving the fact that knowing all peices together gives a unique perspective and hence innovation .like thomas edison , leonardo da vinci , nicholas tesla are all prolific researcher contributing to all scientific discipline .i also believe that some scientific discipline like medicine , only being specialist can provide proper skill to perform well .we trust only specialist when it comes to medical treatment .why we go to eye specialist when we have an eye problem rather than a general physician .the reason being that our body part are so complex that it requires a focussed pursuit of specialized knowledge to understand it .but this does not strongly supports specialist because it is the general physician who also hold vital position in giving initial treatment and direct or recommend physician only in case it crosses it s limit .here we see again that general physician s varied knowledge allow him to better understand and diagonise the problem initially .so in the society we live in today both speacialist ; who pusue specialisation in subject , and generalist ; who have broader knowledge of subject , are important .giving importance to any one will be unjustified ; if not problematic .
