i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .this is very evident when we go to see some sports or carnivals or even a club .more often we find very active and enthusiastic participation of the youth .old people generally do not get interested in new things as easily .new things do not invibe the same level of excitement in old people as it does to the youth .many reason can be given for this difference in the way of looking at life between old people and youth .young people at their stage are still exploring new things in their life .every thing excites them .nothing is usual for them .a base ball match may be just another match for an old man but for a youth it may be very important .he gets involved into it much more and hence enjoys it more too .after a certain age life becomes mundane , every thing seems to be routine .people get used to a very fixed kind of life .small events which ones full filled them with joy seem to be just another thing .one reason could be the coming of stagnation in one s life after a certain age .we get bound by a lot of things after getting old .we refuse to being dynamic .relationships become stagnant , we stop thinking of growth even in our jobs and all these things reduces the interest towards life .wherease someone who is young , say a fresh graduate there is so much unstability in his life which inturn gives his life more dynamism .this keeps his life more interesting and hence he enjoys life more .health aspects can be another reason why young people have more fun .young people are more healthy and spirited .for an enjoyable and fullfilling life good health is very important .in old age , people generally become weak and lose their health too .this prevents them from enjoying their life fully .all the above reasons results in youth people being able to enjoy life more than the older ones .
