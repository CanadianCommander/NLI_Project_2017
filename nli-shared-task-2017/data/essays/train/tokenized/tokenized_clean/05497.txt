it is often said that people will not dirve a car as many as these days in future because prople want to protect envoriments .however , i do not agree with the opinion .i believe that people will use more cars than now in twenty years .this is because , as population grows , demand of car also would be increase .in addition , new cars which uses different kind of resources are starting to advent .first , demand for car will be boomed because population is getting increase .these day , it is almost impossible to move without car .when we go to school , market and even parent s house , we drive a car to get there .this demend of car depends on population .following yonsei university s statisitcs , there are more car where many people live .for instance , seoul , which is a capital of korea , is the city that have lots cars and people .most people live in seoul drive a car and they plan to buy new one for children .this shows that as population increase , more car will be driven .also , there are many new cars that use enviroment friendly resources such as water and sunlight .thoese cars will make people want to buy .these days , many companies can produce these kinds of car without technical problem .in a soon , people can easily see those cars on the streets .as a result , people do not need to worry about pollution .it will make people use more cars than before .most people were afraid that they will destory nature by driving a car .however , new inventions will lead us feel free to drive .from my personal experience , i felt it is not agood idea to drive a car which makes lots of air pollutions .however , when i saw water generated car , i do not worry about that peoblems and want to buy it .it is clearly show that new cars will lead bigger car markets .in summary , i firmly believe that there will be more cars than there are today .increasing population and new cars which operated by enviroment friendly resources such as sunlight and water will result this phenomenon , people should focus on how they improve the situation , not prevent .
