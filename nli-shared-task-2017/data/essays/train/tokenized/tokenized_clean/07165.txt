i agreed about that statement because of two reasons .at first , i think the number of cars will be reduced in the future because of lack of fuel .nowadays , the fuel we used to operate cars has showed the bottom .i think it will be disable to use in the near future , so we will have to find altinative things .another transpertation can be appeared or people can use more public transpertations than cars .we could nt expect what will be the solution to solve lack of fuel , but expect the nember of car is reduced .the second reason that i think is that cars can be products based on trend like other products .when l went to seatle , l saw an interesting sentence on a woman s t-shirts , it was saying `` computer is a trend  it looks like non-making-sence thing , but l thought it was possible .like computers , cars also a products making by a factory and following trend .the color , shape , brend people prefered are always changed by the year s trend .it s possible that people do nt want to have car anymore and prefer another more awesome products .for these two reason
