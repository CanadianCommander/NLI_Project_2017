during thier studies , students face different approaches to work on different materials .these approaches focus either on the learning either on the understanding .they depend on their teachers and on the material itself .so is it more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts ?first of all , from my point of view , learning facts seems to be a good way to study .according to scientists the memory works like a muscle .therefore it has to exercise to become more and more efficient .in addition i agree on the fact that learning facts is an efficient method to get a big amount of knowledge during the studies .however , as far as i m concerned , learning fact is necessary but not sufficicent .on the one hand , this approach should be undertaken in order to get a background on different materails .on the other hand it does nt efficiently prepare student to their futur life .so this method has to be completed by the other approach .for me by understanding ideas and concepts , students know how to adapt to different situations they could face later .for example , in their professional life they wo nt only be asked to use the facts they have learnt during their studies .for me by understanding ideas and concepts they learn a particular way of thinking that could be apply in differents cases .thus this last approach is more important for me .indeed their availability to analyse and adapt to a special situation comes from their faculty to understnad .to conclude , i approve that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .however these two approaches seem to be complementary .in a certain extent .
