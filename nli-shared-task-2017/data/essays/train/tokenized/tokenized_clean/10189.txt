there has been a on going debate whether it is better to study a wide range of academic subjects .some people do not support the idea because they can not focus on one subject so they can not acquire deep information .however , from my perspective , it is better for people to have wide range of knowledge in several academic fields because it will broaden their view to world and they can have a lot of experiences that they can apply to other fields .first of all , they can have wide perspective to the world we live in .this will lead them to have more open mind in society .especially when they are with other people , they can understand other people s lives better because they study diverse academic subjcets so that they know how different opinions do each individuals have .not only can it help them to accept other people s view better , but also it is beneficial for them to have rational thoughts .they will not tend to be biased .additionally , for example , if i study science and history at the same time , i can think logical concept and moral value at the same time .thus , it allows me to get along with everybody as i am well-grounded on interacting with others .moreover , by studying a variety of academic subjects , they can acquire numerous experiences which they can apply into other fields .for example , if i once had studied about computer and now i want to get a job in mathematic field .indeed , my experience as to computer skills can be applied into math too .in order to collect data for surveying , there will be a lot of computer works required .as we can see , learning diverse field can help people to get their knowledge once and they can use these information in several form of their assets .although some people prefer to concentrate their studying in specific field , i maintain that it will bring out more benefits to people to have wide knowledge of many academic area .this is because that it allows them to obtain wider view and they can have more experiences which can be used in order to success in modern society .
