a question has been raised about whether or not the young people nowadays devote their time to helping their communities .in respons to this question , i think that there are two kind of young people nowadays : one kind is more polite , other kind is less polite .usually , the young peole are more polite because they have their parents more quite and more lovely .maybe when this young people have a problem they can ask a help from your parents without having fear to them .so , for this kind of young people is normal to be helped and when they see other person that suffering they would help him or her .instead , the young people are less polite because their parents are more angry or maybe their parents pass few time with them .so , usually when they have some problems they resolve it alone without asking a help and if they see a man who have a problem they think that he or she can resolve alone .so , i think that it s important that the parents pass the most of their time with their children .my parents work every day , and they come back in my home very later .i never asked them to help me because they are nt .so i have difficult to ask or to give a help and i prefer stay alone rather than stay with my community .
