nowadays , there are numorous debats on whether or not understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .from my point of view , i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the following reasons will support my opinion from three perspectives .first of all , ideas and concepts are the foundation of the facts .in addition , in the most textbooks , every chapter begins with the terms and definitions of the ideas and concepts .at the begining of every chapter the professor will ask students to understand every terms and ideas which is included in this chapter .because every subjects have some speical terms the students did not hear before .if they do not understand these ideas and concepts , they will have a lot of difficulties to learn the facts about these ideas .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help students to learn facts more effiectively and efficiently .when the students understand and memorize all the ideas and concepts which they are going to learn about , they are get ready to accept the new facts related to these ideas .forthermore , they will familiar to these facts by the means of they understand ideas and concepts .all of these will help students to learn the facts quickly and correctly .thirdly , students learning facts indicate to memorize the concepts correctly and accurately .in the school , the first objection of students are learning the academic knowlege which refers to the ideas and concepts .later , they will use these knowlege in the working place and connect the ideas with the facts .therefore , in the school students should concentrate on the ideas and concepts , meanwhile , they can use the facts to help them memorize the ideas and concepts accurately .to conclude , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .firstly , the facts is based on the ideas and concepts .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts is a good way for students to learn the facts .lastly , learing ideas and concepts will more beneficial for students achieving their academica goal .therefore , students should make a great effort to understand the ideas and concepts , then to learn facts .
