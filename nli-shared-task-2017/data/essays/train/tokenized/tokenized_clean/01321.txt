i agree the statement .being successful has various meanings , for example economically , socially , or so on ?if i definite being successful as achieving something that others want but do nt have or can not obtain easily , those people who are successful seem to tend to try new things and take risks .firstly , if they want to continue to be successful , they have to try new things and take risks .in the business scene , successful investors try to look for somethings new .they always try to do something different from normal .because only doing something normal can not lead to making money .by searching for different ways , they can have more possibility to encounter better ways and unique ideas .by doing the same things as others , normally it does nt make profits .second , they are tired of only doing what they already know how to do well .they alwasys like to challenge new things and do nt stick to the things they know .they are looking for something that makes them excited .for example , rich peolpe are tired of saving money .as they want to feel excited , they spend money on casino .they want to be risky more than defensivethird , successful people can take risks .they do nt have to defend themselves because they are already well establiesd and stable enough .their stable status makes them challenge new things and take risks .
