i agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their communities .considering too many entertainments in their environment and too many academic assignments in their school , and too less timie to rest , young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related tasks .first , it is too many attractive entertainments in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainments .for example , in my dewelling city , there are full of all kinds of entertainments , such as pub , movie theaters , and department stores .the young people spend their each weekend and holidays on shopping , seeing the movies , and playing .as a result , they have less willingness to devote to their communities .second , it is a great number of school assignments that prevent young people from attending community affairs .today , young students have more homework , assignments , and quizzes to complete than before .because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information , young people are required to do more practice and take more examinations during their education , which reduce their possibility to join communities .finally , it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affairs .for example , in my country , young students have to attend cram school after formal school classes .also , they are expected to take various art or music classes only because their parents ask them to do so .in this case , they could nt have enough time to rest , not to mention that they plan to help their communities .in summary , i agree that today , young people give much less time to helping their communities for several reasons , which may be mentioned above , too many time on entertainments and school assignments and less time to rest .
