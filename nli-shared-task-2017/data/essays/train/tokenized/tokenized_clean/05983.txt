i disagree this question .a lot of people want success thieir life .but success people do nt afraid new advantage .here is one example .you know walt elias disney ?when he built movie company , he need new creat something .actually when he built movie company , nobody recommand what he built company .but he did .then he lack money .he was really poor .so he wanted earned money .but trying to make a new movie is very risk thing to him .however he never give up .because he had dream .he always said `` if you dream it , you can do it !and he got a idea from mice .he confirmed his business .so he lend money from his brother .at first his brother do nt want borrow money to him .because if he fail , he lose money .however he beilieve disney s dream .at last , disney made mouse character .that was `` mickey mouse  after he made mickey mouse , he became a rich .that means trying to risk idea with dream , never reget .also here is another example .i m exchange student .at first , when i said to my parents `` i want to try exchage student program  , my parents disagree .however i had dream .at last i started my risk advantage .actually i was afraid .afraid of english , make friends , adjust new country , etc .i did .i overcome my afraind .trying to risk is nothing .if you have brave and confidence , i recommend try new thing .i think really poor act is afraid of fail .you know what ?we grow by fail .also fail give good lesson for success .these days , successful people try new things .lots of business man try to new business for thier dream .also i will try new things .even if that is very risk .i will try again and again for my dream .so i disagree with following statement .
