the statement , `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  , is a controversial one , but personally i agree with it .thera are many reasons for my to believe that ideas and concepts are more important when students are in a learning process .firstly , when understanding and idea , you should support it with a wide range of examples , but all the facts that could be mentioned are never more worth than the idea itself , just because is the idea the main source for all the facts .consequently i understand that the comprenhension of the ideas is the key for all the facts .on the other hand , i really belive that concepts , even though when they are drawn through empiric examples and high complicated laboratory experiments , will be always concepts .as a matter of fact , those concepts will be ready to be applicated on any new fact .so even though we learn from facts and experiences to get empiric conclusions and therefore new concepts , i have observed during my life that concepts will remain over any fact .besides the arguments listed above , i also support the rule of being up to date on learning ideas and concepts because understanding the causes you will always ready to discover new facts and the insight reasoning of them .otherwise we could get lost in a pool of numbers and figures without knowing how to solve many questions and challenges and turning an easy situaition in a difficult problem , just because the lack of ideas and concepts to overcome it .in conclusion , i close recomend to all students to enhance their abilities to understand the core ideas and concepts on whatever the might be interested on , and to get the skills for future successful career development .
