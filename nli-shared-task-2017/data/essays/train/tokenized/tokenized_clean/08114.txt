in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that are today !this is kind of complicated question , which deals with an complex answer based on different levels .first of all , i will give a short introduction into the present situation of cars and their numbers in the world , because in my opinion it is necessary for the whole part of that complex .after that i will give you pro and contra arguments for each thesis .and in conclusion , i will summarize the facts , i pointed out .through the present paper my focus will be germany , because a wider concentration would be too long and too complex for that essay .since the development of cars in the end of the 19th century and beginning 20th century by famous people like henry ford , cars have become an important fact and enormous increase .in germany cars are the most used and most important transport system , and it has actually an great effect on economy , too - e.g. think about the importance of car export in germany .first of all , an argument pro more cars in use in future bases on statistical phenomena .since the 1950s in germany and other western civilizations there s an great increase of cars by nearly 5 % or more each year .it indicates an increase in the future .in opposite , some people say , the world or every certain region is economical limited , that means there s no space for an unlimited increase .second , people say the techniques , computers and high-level knowledge become more important and will be more specialized , too .that has a great effect to the car production , what , hence , has an effect to the number of cars , too .in opposite , if the ecomony will grow and if the high-technique will grow , there will be an another development , which replaces cars .third , the more population is in germany or in the wolrd , the more cars will be used .but of course we know there s a stagnation of german s population , nowadways .this are the major points and there are of course , a lot of more social , political and environmental aspects , too .in conclusion , i guess there will be a balance of the cars in use and there will not be a large increase than today .
