if someone is successful and wants to try new things and takes risks it is her or his decision .it is a big challenge because you do not know whether you will success in this new thing or not .anyways , there are some positive aspects that we can look at .first of all , if people try new things it will be a challenge for them .as a matter of fact they will learn new stuff and maybe they will get successful in this one also .the people who like challenging can get successful if they really want to learn something new .for example i took in highschool fashion design although i had never done it before and did not know how to work with it .of course it was a challenge for me .i got successful in it because i wanted to do it and because i had fun .another reason why successful people want to try more things is maybe they are bored of the things which they already know how to do well and always do .maybe they know that they take risks but they try it and if it will not work than they try other things .my friend was so bored of being a babysitter and working as a babysitter .she tried to work in kindergarten but unfortunately it did not work and she still tries to find a new job which will be a challenge for her .as a result i agree with this statement .you can whether take a risk or you get successful again .but it is a challenge and if you take a risk and it did not work than you know you can try other stuffs because there are thunds of stuffs out there that everybody can try if he or she really wants to .some of the people are just successful in everything .
