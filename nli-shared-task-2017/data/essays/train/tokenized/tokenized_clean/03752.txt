i strongly believe that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , the main cause for this being so is that that s precisely the aim of advertisments .during the 20th century , the approach on selling products have shifted from believing that having a good product was enough to sell it , to believing that aggresive marketing was a must .this means that nowadays companies believe that having a good product is not enough , but that you must make the public aware of your product and convince it of how good your product actually is .but , why is nt enough to show a good product as it really is ?simply because such an approach would nt make most products stand out in the wide varierty of products now available .let s look , for example , at washing machine s soaps : every company , from ariel to ala , claim their soap is tremendously better than any other competitor .or car manufacturer s : every single brand states their cars are the fastest and most secure cars in the market .clearly , all of them ca nt be right .most of them must be making their products seem much better than they really are .another way of seeing that advertisments make products seem better than what they trully are is thinking about this : when was the last time you heard an advertisment state any disadvantege to their products , any weak points ?i do nt think i ever did .but clearly , products have weak points and disadvantages .even if all good things advertisments say about their products are true , those products are nt likely to be perfect , so by stating the good things and hiding the not so good ones , they are making their product look better than what it actually are .this can be understand if we keep in mind that advertisments aim at selling products , and so will do everything possible to convince customers of buying them , without attempting to provide an objective view .in conclusion , most advertisments make products look better than they really are , and this can be seen in the fact that most of them claim their products to be the best in the market and fail to mention any weak those products may have .
