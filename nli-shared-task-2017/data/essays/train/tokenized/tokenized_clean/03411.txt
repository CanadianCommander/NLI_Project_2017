cars an efficent and comfortable mode of transport available to people today .i do not believe that in twenty years time , the number of cars will reduce .their usefulness is immense and thus it is improbable that they will be replaced by alternative modes of transport .however , it is quite likely that cars as we know them today may not be quite so popular twenty years from now .this could be on account of several reasons .of course , human need for better and better products will drive invention and cars will become smaller , faster and more efficient .however , the fuel prices might also have a major role to play in determining the types of cars in existence .with petroleum prices going through the roof , it is quite likely that the major fuel would shift from being petroleum to electricity or some other renewable resource .it may be argued that public transport being cheaper , would become the preferred mode of transport on account of rising running cost of cars .however , it would not do to underestimate human ingenuity .i believe that we are innovative enough to find new and better ways of running our cars so that they still remain an attractive proposition .also , the population of the world is increasing .also , it is increasing most rapidly in developing countries like china and india where the buying power is also simulaneously increasing .with increasing population and buying power , the demand for the number of cars would rise .therefore , i think it is very unlikely that the number of cars twenty years from now would be fewer than today .there is also the issue of infrastructure required to run cars .many people might argue that with increasing number of cars , the existing infrastructure of roads , highways etc. would become overloaded and thus dissuade people from buying cars .however , i believe that with the developed world , the issue of infrastrucutre is not major and in the developing world , infrastructure projects are just taking off .therefore , twenty years from now , the developing countries are going to be much better equipped to handle the increased number of cars .hence , this would not be a major issue to car buyers .thus , i believe that all factors indicate that the number of cars is going to see a steady increase .therefore , i think that it is quite unlikely that the number of cars in twenty yeras will be fewer than there are today .
