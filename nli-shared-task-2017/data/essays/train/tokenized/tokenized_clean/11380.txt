this is a very difficult question , which i ca nt answer by saying `` yes  or `` no  .there are arguments for both opinions .on the one side , you have to think of the less devoloped countries of today .they will clearly have economic progress and more wealth for the people within the next twenty years .for example , the quality of life in countries like china or india has been improved within the last decades .and qualitiy of life means having your own car , as it is common in europe or northern america .so , in the year 2026 , the world could be faced with inhabitans of former `` third world  countries who drive their own car .one the other side , the problems of carbon dioxide , such as global warming or more tornados , will leed to a different way to consider the use of energy .the `` green house effect  is more and more acknowleged among scientists , and maybe somedays also the governments will consequentially deal with this problem .cars are one of the main producers of coarbon dioxide .so , if you want to try to stop global warming , one possibility could be to reduce the number of cars .maybe the governments - instead of making it possible for their citizens to have an own car - will improve the public traffic systems like buses or trains , or they will try to develope new technologies which are nt dependent on fossile energy , like solar energy nowerdays .in germany , also the taxes on fuel are very high .the government tries this way to make the people become aware of their use of fuel and maybe to reduce it .finally , no one knows what the technological or economical developement of the world will be like within the next twenty years .but these developements will extremely influence the number of cars .i think , the second version is more probable and therefore i agree with the statement above .the idea of millions of chineses and indians driving their own cars and producing much more carbon dioxide than today is nt very convenient .
