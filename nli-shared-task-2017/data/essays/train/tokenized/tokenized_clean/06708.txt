i think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary , it is the first step of a good education , a good foundation giving the best chances to adapt .but then it is often required to get a specialization .in our society being specialized in one specific subject is more and more a necessity , vital to get a job or to hold a position in a company .also it helps to have a better salary .it will often depend on the type of work or position .for example , lawyers should have broad knowledge of the legal system , the main legal principles and cases .but during their training , they are required to choose a specialization .corporate lawyers should have a good practice and experience in company law .they can not practice in public law and be good at it at the same time .these subjects are too different .the more they can get an experience in a specific area of law , the best they will be in their area , the more they will be competent , recognised and well-paid .the issue is the same for people working in research or in the medical sector .after a certain number of years of study , a specialization is often mandatory for a certain number of jobs .but the above mentioned statement can be exact for managers for example who should have a good knowledge of many areas of their companies in order to be able to take the right and appropriate decisions
