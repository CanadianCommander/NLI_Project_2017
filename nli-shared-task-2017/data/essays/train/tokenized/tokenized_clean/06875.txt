fist of all , we need to think about envoirement .so my anwer is definitly `` yes , i agree .of course , everything was very easy and possible because of cars .they re really usefull and convinent .and we are already good at that situation .this means it will be very difficult us to give up driving cars .but we know the first period of life on the earth , people did not die .they could live .i want to say it could be a habit just for us .habits can be change by efforts .but the envoirement which was distroyed by human being can not be recorver .i m sure about the judgement which we have to choose .no one will give up their life .but everyone can change their life style for their serious health problems .what kinds of thing will be instead of cars ?i want to suggest bicycle !for the both of a good envoirement and a health , it s really good .many people also have good memories which connected with childhood and bicycle . ..we have to care about our future
