in my opinion , i feel that the opinion is preferable that understanding ideas and concepts are more significant than learning facts for students because of several reasons .first , it would not be interesting to learn facts too much .by teaching for students ideas and concepts , the students would be getting interested in the subject which is facts more .for example , for my case , i did not like biology because it seems so difficult for me .when i read about biological textbook , i gave up reading soon after i started to read the book .however , during the biology class , my biology teacher showed us familiar examples and some ideas and concepts .after the class , i could read the textbook once i gave up before without thinking that it is difficult .it was quite interesting .because of the teacher , now i like biology and in the future i would like to get job that is related to biology .due to this case occured for me before , i think it is more important to understand them rather than to learn facts .second , it is going to be very debatable if the students received an education about ideas and concepts more than facts .it means that both the teachers and the students enjoy the classes because the students would suggest many opinions against the ideas and concepts .i think it encourages the teachers to teach something .it is because if the teachers teach fact too much and do nt teach concepts , the students would not be able to understand about facts , and they would not pay attention about the topic .for teachers , it should be avoidable thing .third , the process to understand ideas and concepts are quite significant than understanding facts .it let students to think about something , so they can state their own opinion .it is really important to have your own opinion today s world , so i agree the idea .facts are important too , but you ca nt actually learn without understanding ideas and concept for anything .
