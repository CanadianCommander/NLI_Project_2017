in my view , it is better to have a knowledge on a specialize subject rather than having broader knowledge of many academic subjects because if the person is carrer oriented then he has to specialized in that particular field instead learning all the subjects which is a waste of time and money .this not only saves ones time but also gives the thorough and coherent knowledge and skills about that subject .the reason that i agree with this point is that i have observed one of my classmate who was very much interested in all the subjects and plus he was career oreinted too .he spends time gaining knowledge of the subjects .at last , when the real time came , he was helpless and finally didnt succeed in his career .by seeing his expereince i have learnt that `` the more you learn , the more you forget  and finally you will be remauned with a single pie in your hand .so knowledge in terms of academic aspects depends on your interest and career .so if you want acquire more knowledge , you have to sacrifice the other part of life .by this a nice proverb can be evolved `` a bird in hand is worth than two ina bush  .this implies if you are interested in one particular field then stay tuned to that paricular field rather than showing interest in various activities .but some parts of the statements sounds sometimes true because through his knowledge only we acquire wisdom .if the person haves the knowledge with wisdom he can stand tall in life .for ex : - john abraham .through his wisdom only america is successful today .coming back to the point , if one does his work in a specific and significant way , he can achieve success , so i totally disagree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject  .
