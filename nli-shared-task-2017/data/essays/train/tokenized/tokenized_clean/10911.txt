i do nt completely agree with the statement for different reasons .of course it is important for students to understand concepts , and not only to understand them , but also to keep them clearly in mind and make them be a huge part of their knowledge .but on the other hand , i also think that learning fact has its importance : in fact , most of the times a student is not even able to understand a concept throughfully if he doesn  t know anything real related to that idea .i mean , it is important to have a knowledge of what had happened in history , it is part of one s culture and will be useful in one s private and working life , i think .knowing ideas and concepts in astract has its relevance , of course , but is not enough : usually you ca nt understand the thinkings of important people and philosophers of the past , if you do nt have any idea about the period they lived in or the facts that occurred in their lives .i reckon that students have to learn facts , even if it is boring : most of the times teachers are aware that students are not really interested in them , and that they would rather being thaught something more exciting .nevertheless , students understand how important it is for them to learn facts when they grow up , because they will know what to say in every situation and to every kind of people they will speak to .with my statements , i m not trying to say that understand ideas and concepts is nt important : not at all !i am only saying that both ways should be used with students because they have quite the same importance , in different ways .it also depends on the kind of student a teacher is teaching to : maybe someone prefers one way while another prefers the other one : they are both good ways of learning , i guess , and should both be used to build one s mind .
