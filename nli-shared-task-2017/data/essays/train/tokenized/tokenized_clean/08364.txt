yes , i am agree with this statement because if the students understand clearly and know the idea and the concept of something , they can expect what to wait and how to act in any situation .is better be prepared than learn on the way and receive punished por that .so is very important that the students be prepare all they can , study and learn all the tools the human being needs on their live .the education is very important because this help the person to resolve the daily problems and get a better live .i think a person dont have knowledge is a person dont have nothing to talk and to say the to the other people .an educated person is better because this knowledge help you to your entire life and not to be an ignorant .yes ignorant is the better word to describe a not educated person because if you dont know about nothing how you can share with others your opinion about something , about any topic .so if you understand the ideas and concepts , you are not a ignorant person and you the talk with anyone about any topic and you can defend your point or statement of something .then you go to the facts , that is like an example of the idea or concepts you are observing .actually , this fact help you to undestarnd more cleary your ideas and concepts but , if you don know and understand what is the concept you could never see , how the fact works , why the fact is , so you maintain as a ignorant all your life because you see something but dont know what is it .in summery i agree this satatement about that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because the intelligent and brillant people have a trick , their trick is , the knowledge and the education .if you are a educated people you are a person with a lot of experience and knowlegde to share in your life .that is very good .
