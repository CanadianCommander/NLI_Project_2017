new things and taking risksnowadays when you turn on tv you will probably see a discussion program about the importance of trying new things and taking risks .although some people think that to be successfull , people should not do new things which means risks , i think the best way to become successeful in our era is doing new things and taking risks for mainly two reasons .to begin with , new things means new opportunities and as a result of this while people do something for the first time , they also have the change of getting its benefits for the first time .for instance , let s think that you are the first person who opens a hamburger restaurant .in other words you are doing a new thing with high risk level .however you will be more successful than any other person who does the same thing after you ; becaus you will be able to make a lot of profit before others understants that this is a profitable way .as you can see this will be the opportunity that you get as a result of taking risks .secondly , new things makes people able to do whatever they want and as a result of this , they can easily become successful .for example , mickey mouse is so famous today ; however the inventor of this character tried something new in order to do the things he had imagined .infact when he planed to draw this character he was not sure about the popularity of mickey mouse but he took the risk and become successful .opponents argue that , doing new things means lots of stress and this prevents people from being successful .however this is unlikely tp be true ; because altough there may be some problems at the begining , after a while the risk takers will probably become sucessfull and then everything will be easier and less stressful for him or her .to sum up , i thinf doing new things and taking risks are the key facters to become a successful person .i thing everybody should be aware of this .if they are then our world would become a better place to live in .do not you agree ?
