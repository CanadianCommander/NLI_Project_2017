i do nt agree with the statement about most advertisements make their products better than they really are .it undoubtful give some fake permitions to people and would makes nobody to believe any advertisements any more .there was an old adverticment about mallbore .in that advertisment an actor who always acted as a cowboy was showing in it .this advertisment made people , especially young men believed smoking was relativing to `` cool  .however , this actor died of lung cancer finally .but the fact is that nobody knows during his life time how many young died or would die an same reason because of this fake advertisment .thus this kind of advertisement really does bad thing to people .it s hard to deny that there really are some advertisements are true , good to people .but , ask youself , how much dare you believe in advertisements , because you can not point out which of them is real .depend on the same reason , nowadays , advertisments are not a way to tell people what kind of product they can buy , instead they are becoming are kind of boring show on tv .so the bad advertisement harm the people who believe them , and at the same time they hurt this field , too .from these reasons , i think nobady would nt agree with my situation , especially those who were cheated by some bad advertisements .i was worked in this field , so i could see both of these .so i hope it would not happen again .
