the role of a student is learn as much as possible from olders ideas to create is own ones .then he need to relate that idea with an older idea to learn it .but to do that is important understand the concepts that gave origin to that idea .because the idea is based in concepts that are observed due to an especific situation .for example if we want to create a research projects we motivate our studies due to the knowledge that we obtain from book or past research .but the idea that was create due to that knowledges are base in similaritites that we observed or some facts that are present in the area of interest .so , for that reason i think an student need to learn but more important is understand the facts that form those concepts but mo for that reason i disagree with the statement presented here .
