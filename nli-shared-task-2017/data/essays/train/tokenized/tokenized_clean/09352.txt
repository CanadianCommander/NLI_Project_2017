communities always need help from engaged people .they look for young people to organize a kid s club or choirs for example .but communities nowadays have trouble finding young engaged people to help them with their work , i agree with this statement .to my mind , some young people are very engaged in community work and are willing to help other people , even today .but in general , i think , young people are more interested in meeting friends , doing sports or work in a job , where they are able to earn extra money .to my mind , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .one reason , why they are not willing to help in a communtity may be , because it is a lot of work , but they usually will not get money for their work .another reason why young people are not interested in doing community work is because they may seem boring and less exciting to their peers .young people nowadays have to risk something and have to do fun things to be accepted from their peer group .in my opinion , not only the young people nowadays play an important role in not helping the community , but the communities themselves have to become more interesting for young people .they could make the jobs they have to offer more appealing to young people by honoring their work in front of the whole community with certificates , for example .another point is , that communities could organize more meetings for young people who help .they could offer trips to those and they could try to engage a lot of friends to do the work together .so , not only young people have to be more engaged , but also do communities have to be more creative in order to get young people s attention .all in all , i can say that on the one hand , young people have to show more respect towards their community and be willing to help , but on the other hand communities have to make their work attractive to young people .
