broad knowledge is more effective because it enhances diversity .as for today s world , development and technology requires human beings to have extensive knowledge and display multifacetic characteristics .we do not live anymore in a world where we were forced to specialize in one thing to survive .today , it works differently .people are now exposed to more information and learning , thus stretching there overall knowledge .the vast range of information , together with people s desire to succeed , make them better prepared for the unknown future .the 21st century brought with it the availability of information , thus promoting faster learing .with this phenomenon , people are exposed to vast amounts of information that allow them to develop and grow .for example , some who is more aware of world events is more praised than someone who only knows about the war going on in iraq .by having the mechanisms to obtain information , people want more and more , thus creating competition .if you are competing for a job place as an accountant suppose , and your rival knowns computer managing in addition to accounting , while you just know accounting , your rival results more efficient for the company .the disire to succeed in this world creates a lot of competition amongst the people .with the wide range of information and technologies , the world expects people for more , thus we are forced to learn more things .diversity then comes in play in this situation .today , success is about being efficient and useful .hence , people who know how to do more things and better understand more things , is rather wanted .in conclusion , in relation to the present world , knowledge in better appriciated for its quantity rather than quality .obviously , everything has its limits , for some has to understand at least the basics of many things .
