a car , today , is a necessity for many people .saying that , in twenty years from now , there will be fewer number fo cars is not true .cars today have become passion for the people , a status symbol and if someone does nt own , he or she dreams about owning a car .they work hard to achieve their dreams .although , many people points out that fossil fuels is getting expensive and we are using it up at a very fast rate .this will lead us to a time , when there will no fossil fuels .but these people are not aware that , a lot of research has been done to find an alternative fuel .these days , we have cars available which do nt run on petrol or diesel but on hydrogen ( known as fuel cell cars ) .this fuel has one more advantage of not polluting our environment .even companies have produced cars which run on both petrol and electricity ( better known as , hybrid cars ) .so , there will be fuel available in future for our cars to run .moreover , for most people cars have become necessity rather than comfort .people are growing richer due do booming economy and higher pays .so , they love the comforts provided by the cars .today s youngsters are , even , more crazy about cars .every teenager has a dream ( either known to him or hidden ) to own a specific car .they will be the consumer of tomorrow .its clear form this fact also that , in future there will be people to buy the cars .they may want to show-off or enjoy a ride with love ones or go on a long drive to relieve stress but one thing is for sure cars will always be in fashion .the number of cars will be more in future as compared to today .as evident form the recent news that all the major car making companies in the world , like ford , ferrari , toyota etc. , are expanding their production capacity .if more cars are being manufactured than they previously were , then how can we expect that there will be a decrease in the number of cars in future .
