i agree that is very essential for a student to learn the basic ideas and concepts from an early satge .facts about a certain subject can be understood only when a foundation is laid by ideas and concepts .ideas and concepts form the fundamental building blocks in the learning process .it helps one learn and understand a thought process accurately and profoundly .it helps a person learn important aspects of a subject at an easy pace .when a student is given the opportunity to think about an idea , a new concept is formed based on the facts .facts can not be changed but ideas and concepts can be altered and changed according to the interest of the student .a student in chemistry will able to perform an experiments with ease only when he or she learns the basic fundamentals .for instance , only when a student can understand the simple concept of what an acid or base is the , the student will be able to decide the correct steps of an experiment .similarly a person who goes to visit a modern art museumcan learn about facts of modern art from books , peers or from lectures .but only when he initially develops an idea on what modern art is all about , will he enjoy the art that is displayed .technology is based on ideas and thoughts and not merely by facts .only when different concepts are put together a new product is produced which helps in the economy of a country .todays  generation can not depend on just facts to learn newer concepts .learning through different ideas , keeping in par with today s current pace will help one mold ideas and thoughts for a better development .hence to conclude ideas and concepts are like pillars of a building without which a strong foundation can not be laid for the developemant of the future .
