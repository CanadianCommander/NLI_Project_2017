i agree with the statement .in my opinion it is more important to understand ideas and concepts , than to know facts and just repeat them .you can talk about an idea or concept if you really know the background of it .so if you have the knowlegde about a topic and you take part in a discussion you really know what you are going to talk about .also facts are important to understand points but they are better to underline your knowledge , but if you just know facts you can not express yourself .so you have to link the facts you know with your own knowledge to build a concept .with a concept you can express yourself so that other people will understand you .it is not like telling them some facts they will not understand if they do not really know what the topic is about .with the concept you have you can explain every small detail they want to know and they will understand , because you know what you are talking about .another point is about ideas .in contrary to facts you do not have to copy ideas , you can make your own mind of something .understanding an idea means to understand someones opinion , you can support the opinion or you reject it and build your own opinion .this special point is very important to me , i really unlike people who do not even have their own opinion , because i can not talk to them and they just agree what i tell them .to come to an end i want to say that it is very important to give ideas and concepts to students , because they are going to learn to think on their own and to build an own opinion .we should not leave out facts , because their are good to keep in mind but not to express yourself .
