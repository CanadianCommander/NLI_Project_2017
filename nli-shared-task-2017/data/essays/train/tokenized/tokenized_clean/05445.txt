these days , since the transpotation is developed and many people are financially stable , they have lots of opportunities to travel in other countries .of course , there are several ways to trip , however , i personally agree the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , due to the following reasons .first of all , people can get lots of benefits to follow the experienced guide .because they are in the strange country , they do not know the information about famous places , convenient hotels , restarants and so on .in addition , the guide can prevent them not to get lost , and any inccidental dangers .if a traveler confronts a trouble , the person can use the wary , from the guide .in other words , emplying tour guide is useful for travel .moreover , people can plan or choose the perfact travel curriculum .for example , if a person has not enough time to travel , he or she can get best iternity through the advice from a tour company , and spend time usefully .in addition , the peroson can spend less money to trip , because the travel company usually require not costly price .lastly , group activity is interesting , especially in the newly places .people usually meet new people in traveling .therefore , they have chances to be more sociable and make wider human relationships .they can also learn and share their opinion about new things each other .it is also preciouse experience for individuals .in conclusion , traveling with a tour guide offers convenient service , cheaper expense for trip , and more joyable time with other people .nowadays , most people think that personal behavior and private is more important than any other things , but in traveling , from my point of view , it is different .
