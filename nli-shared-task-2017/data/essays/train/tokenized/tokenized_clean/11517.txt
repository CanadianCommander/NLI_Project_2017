the concepts and the ideas that a person has developed in a particular subject is a direct implication of the amount of profound knowledge that he has acquired in that subject .in my view understanding the ideas and the concepts is more important for a student that to learn the facts .facts just act as the supporting information to the concepts and the ideas , but they do not play a major role in learning about the subject .in any major stream , the person who knows the concepts and who is capable of understanding the ideas will have the leading voice .for example , in a software industry the facts are not at all considered .they just act as the background information for the work that should be done .the main thing that matters is the concepts and the ideas .furthermore , if we take any entrance exam or any academic examination the main emphasis is on the type of the ideas that student is capable of generating for a particular problem .a minor importance is given to the facts .fact just support the ideas and the concepts .they act as the evidences only .for example , many of the scholars and the scientists had a firm believe in their concepts and the ideas and moved forward but they never considered the facts .only after they arrive at a conclusion about the study upon which they are working , then they co-relate this result with the facts .fact are not reliable .generally facts change when a new discovery has been made .but the concepts and the ideas will not change .they are the building blocks of the subject .facts just support the concepts and the ideas .further , when a person has a strong knowledge about the facts about a particular subject , which generally tend to change then he may not have a profound knowledge about the subject .the amount and the depth of the concept that an individual has in any core subject is a basis on which his knowledge in the subject is measured .and also , a person who has the keen and the depth knowledge is likely to get fruitful results than to a person whose main emphasis is on the facts .furthermore , in an elementary school and in the high when the students are at a tender age the main emphasis is upon the concept but not on the facts .facts are given minor importance there .in sum , i think that the ideas and the concepts play a major role for a student than when compared to the facts .
