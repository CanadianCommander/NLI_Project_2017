as students start off in college , during your undergraduate years they experience the broad spectrum of knowledge , they take courses from different departments , such as : english , spanish , mathematics , social sciences , arts , etc .the main goal is to prepare an intergral individual and at the same time expose students to new disciplines .after college , hopefully you move into graduate studies and your knowledge is directed towards a specific area , its like a diamond shape effect , you learn a little bit of everything as a college student and then you learn a lot about a certain area during graduate school .i believe a combination of both is perfect , its good to know a little about everthing and at the same time a lot about a certain area , but since i have to pick sides i would say that its better to specialize in one specific subject .broad knowledge gives you flexibility , but specialized knowledge designs experts in a certain area .for example , interdisciplinary research encompasses both broad and specific .scientists with different expertise get together to solve a problem .specific knowledge creates new mind sets in the students and prodessionals .specially when a group of scientists gather to solve a problem .chemists , physics mayors and math
