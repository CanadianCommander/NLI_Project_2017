its always good to have broad knowledge of many subjects as this is going to help the individual to deal with a variety of situations .one can always increase his or her knowledge by going through a variety of topics , so that he/she should not be naive to a particular topic .one can always improve on the basis of knowledge by going through the topic in a detailed way .as it does nt hurt to try things in many fields of life .its always good to know about various aspects of life similarly its always good to have knowledge about various academic fields thats why we have all the subjects when we are in junior classes but as we grow the subjects however , i strongly believe that one should specialize in one particular subject .but its also better to have an indepth knowledge of a particular subject , one can be a master of a particular topic as that is going to help oneself professionally .success depends on indepth knowledge and skills and with knowledge one can be master of one s own destiny .its always important to apply knowledge in one particular direction .the second step to specialization is updation .one should always keep a track on the current events on his/her field of interest .say forexample a pharmacist should know about all the medicines that he/she is dispensing .it is an additional advantage for him to have knowledge about the disease but he should not afford to not to have in depth knowledge about medicine as itsgoing to cost a patient his / her life .and its his/her responsibility to guide a patient about all the medicine .aquiring knowledge about new fields is always good but not at the cost of one s own field of specialization .but its always discouraged to be `` jack of all and master of none
