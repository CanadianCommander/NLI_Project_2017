some people emphasize learning facts at the education my country korea is also following that belief and whole education is established under that concept .however , while i go through the 12 year s korean education system , i found that it is not good for students .i prefer the other way , emphasizing understanding ideas and concept at the education , since it makes students be able to use their knowlege , be creative and enjoy learning .most of all , even though students know facts , if they ca nt understand them , they ca nt use their knowledge .when i took music class , teacher explained me about chords - c , d , e , minor , major , etc. - but i could nt play music by them .however , very after i hear those chords by touching the keys of piano and understand what they are , i could play lots of songs .such a smart idea it was to understand the concepts , not satisfied by only know them .moreover , understanding ideas and concepts make students more creative .if students learn only facts , they only know about that .however , if they understand the original ideas and concepts , they can creat and change those in their own way .this experience may extend their knowledge and give a new concept of futher study .indeed , it s significant to understand ideas and concepts since it make them creative .furthermore , students become enjoying learning while they understand concepts and ideas .as understanding ideas and concepts , they can feel the joy of discovery .they can feel the feeling of the one who first find the theory .it make them enjoy learnig and study by themselves .always , people who wants to study well , they should enjoy it and understanding concepts and ideas helps them to be like that .in conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is better and more important for students oweing to that they can use their knowedge , become creative and feel joy when they study .if the education systems of countries follow this way , it might be better for the students of that country .i suggest my country korea to choose that way , either .
