i do think that successful people try new things instead of doing only what they already know , and i agree that learning something new and taking risks is key for beeing a steap ahead the others .new experiences allow you to try out yourself , to understand your abilities and your lacks , and give you the an opportunity of prove how worth a person is .the first person that comes in my mind when i think to a successful man is cristoforo colombo , the seaman that has discovered america .during a historical period when nobody was believing in this project , reaching india with an other route , he decided to try .facing the common opinion he went to the king for clering his doubts about the projects .after a long time during which he had to face the strong reactions to his idea and the opinion of the people , he eventually got the ships and the money for his journey .he has demontrated how important beeing confident is and how taking risks can actually pay off .the fact that in the end he did not reached india does no reduce his success , because the main point is that he has demonstrated to europe how good his idea was .his courage has allowed him to become one of the most important man of is century and even more .on 5the other side , people who do not try new things , are not able to find out who they are .i personally consider what they do like hiding beside what they have already obtained .it is a good way for surviving but it no brings that mach on the long-term .
