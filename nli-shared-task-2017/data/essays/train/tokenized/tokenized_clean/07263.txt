the question whether young people enjoy life more than the older generations .it is an intriguing question .as one might feel that the energetic young people , are more likely to have enjoyable experiences compared to the senile old people .however i completely disagree with the statement and feel that enjoyment in life is not constrained by age .for one reason i beleive that age has no bearing on the good moments in life is when i see an old person jogging around merrily in the park compared to a young guy suffering from lung disorders , admitted in the hodpital , resulting from smoking .the younger generation could be sometimes be too careless and headlong in their approach towards life as compared to the old and mature folks .the young people believe that they should go for everything they feel will give them pleasure and live every moment to the fullest .in doing that they present an outer picture of joy happiness but it could not be so good afterall .ok lets talk about sports , ever wondered about the young players on the field and the older retired players sitting in the commentary box describing every action of the game .does nt the game give the same amount of pleasure to both on field , young players and off field old guys who are thrilled and nostalgic of their times .can we qantify their enjoyment ? , we cant .each of us enjoy in a different way .the older people have much more experiences and lessons from their life which they can share with their friends and childrens .i agree an old man cant race his motorbike or overspeed , the popular source of fun for the younger generations , but doesnt an old man enjoy playing with his grandson or teaching him a game of chess , or riding a bicycle .cant he reflect upon the achievements of his life and feel contented .its a matter of how we take life and cherish its moments .finally , its not about age , enjoyment in life is solely about our approach towards life , for some people life begins at forty .i have seen so many old aged convivial gourmets who still enjoy tasting the wine and educating the younger people about the various wines .its just one simple example which depicts that age doesnt restrict enjoyment .i ultimately beleive that enjoyment in life transcends the boundaries set by factors like age or health .senility could be a period of tremendous fun and enjoyment .young or old joy , is knocking our doors , we need to open the door .
