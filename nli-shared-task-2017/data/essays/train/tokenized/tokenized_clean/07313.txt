it is widely believed that successfull people try new things and take risks instead of concentrating on something they already know very well .on the one hand people who want to be successful should rely on their skills they already have .it is very important to take an advantage of the qualities a person already has , so that this person is sure to do the right things , which means that the person is self-confident .but on the other hand a rigid behavior could influence the work in a negative way .for example it is very important for managers who run their own business to stay flexible so that they can react to every change of the customers choice .the customers choice could change every day , so the manager has to adapt his procuts in order be successfull .otherwise he will not sell enough products .a good example could be advertising .you must have new ideas to impress the people seeing yor advertisement in order to push their attention to your product .sometimes it is also essential to take any risk in order to improve your business , because it could be a chance to multiply your success .of course such decisions are very difficult and you have to think about them very carefully .all in all i think that it is a big advantage if a person has enough courage to take risks or to try something new because in most cases it is worth it .in spite of short-term negative impacts it is important to be innovative in order to be a successfull person .rigid behaviour causes disadvantages in nearly every part of life .in my opinion it might be helpfull to stick to the well-practised skills a person has , but everyone can improve these skills and learn new thinks in order to achieve his aims .that is why i think that this statement is right .
