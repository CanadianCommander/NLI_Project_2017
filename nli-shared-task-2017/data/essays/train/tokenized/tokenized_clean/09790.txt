generally speaking , young people are the most important role-players in any community ; as they are able to give more .in my opinion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .for example , what a young man cares about these days is where to find the newest and coolest video games , where he can download the latest mp3s and albums , or where to get a party held for fun . ..and the list never ends !young people in the middle ages , unlike nowadays , had more pasion to work .for instance , they used to work in farms so they earn their living which enables them to get what they want and live their lives .while youngs depend on their parents in everything nowadays , young people had been responsible before .for example , youngs used to get married when they were at the beginning of their teen age .but on the other hand , by looking in the records of what youngs provided to their communities nowadays , we just find few good examples .some young people participated in humanitarian organizations , which were very important means to help poor people around the world survive and live .other examples might be young scientists .have nt you heard about the 13 years old scientist who came up with a new method of calculation ?yes its true !the method is now being taught in cambridge university and many professors admited that it is very effecient .all what was mentioned above leads us to a point , which clearly shows that young people are a treasure , and they are a double-edged weapon .communities ( parents in the first place ) should guide their kids and teach them to be giving , not only taking , as no one can deny the fact that says `` the more you give , the more you get !
