knowledge is divine .it does not decrease if you spread it to others .there is nothing wrong in knowing about everything that is going around you .but , you have to look at your future .you are going to do a job , or run a business , for which your basics in that should be strong and you should have good knowledge about that subject .personally , i feel it is better to specialize in a particular , or specific subject .during your schooling days , you are taught on a variety of subjects ; in brief .this knowledge is enough for any person .a person has to decide as to what he is aiming at , and start working towards his aim by taking a specialization in that subject .this should start right from his secondary schooling days .in this fast paced world , it is very important for a person to specialize in any subject which he feels to be interesting .by doing so , he can grab the oppurtunity presented to him , in that specific subject , with both the hands .if he is not prepared for any specific job , there are chances that he might end up doing a job far lesser to what he is capable of doing .moreover specialization develops the interest in the subject , and he will feel satisfied with his job .if a person is not specialized in any subject , and he has a broad knowledge of all the subjects , he wo nt be able to recognize the subjects of his interest , and he might end up doing a job from which he might not get enough satisfaction .for example , there is a person named anand .he was a very bright student , but he used to focus on many subjects .he went in search for a job , but he failed to get the job because he was not good enough in that subject .hence , we must get specialized in one specific subject , and work towards acheiving our aim .
