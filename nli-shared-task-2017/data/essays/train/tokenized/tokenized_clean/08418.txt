a lot of young people i know want to live their life in a very intense way while they are still young .they think that when they get old they will not be able to enjoy life as much as they do now .but is this really true ?well , first of all young people normally are healthier than older people .so they are able to be active every day and do all kinds of sports or to travel a lot .they can also go out at night till very late , have fun in bars and clubs .by doing so they get to know a lot of people and make a lot of friends .while still at school young people are most likely to have more free time than adults in which they can do whatever they want .they are less responsible for others than older people are and can therefore try out more things .on the other hand older people do nt have to find out what they like , they already know it .maybe they have less time because they have to go to work , but they have enough money to afford their hobbies .also other things in life get more and more important .like family or the job .most people who enjoy their job also enjoy their life .all in all i do nt think that young people enjoy their life more than older people .i think that they have just different ways to enjoy their time .and none is better than the other .it s just a process that we all go through .what we mean by `` enjoying life  changes as we get older .and older people already had their `` wild times  - when they were young .
