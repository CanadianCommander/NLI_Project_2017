i partly agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use then there are today in twenty years .i do agree partly with this statement because of several reasons .firstly , we live in a world that constantly changes .if i talk to my grandparents or even my parents today , it is astounding how much the world has changed during there life s .this is why i think is likely that this will continue .regarding cars it is obvious for me that there will have to be changes .for one , the gas is getting more and more expensive .therefore , people have to think about cheaper ways to travel and transport things as well as themselves .as a matter of fact , one can already realise the fact that people are trying to use their car less often than a few years ago .the train is even used more and the german train company states in its advertisment states that going by train often is much cheaper than driving a car .additionally , it is not only a matter of money , but also a matter of the protection of the environment .even if the gas was not as expensive as it is now , there would have to be a change .the air pollution produced by the cars nowadays is too dangerous for all the people living in the world .it will and it has already caused serious problems .this is why i think and why i hope that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now .however , it is an illusion to think that we can live without cars or even with a lot fewer cars .people are too used to use their cars all the time .this is why there has to be another way .the governments all over the world should invest in the discovery of new ways of transportation .for instance to use solar engergy to run different cars .this is why i only partly agree with the statement .if the people do not try to find different , cheaper and less dangerous , ways for transportation , there will be no way that the number of cars decreases within in the next twenty years .furthermore , i can not really imagine that the number of cars will decrease a lot in as much as twenty years .but it could start to decrease which would be a step in the right direction .all in all , i think especially because of financial problems that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , even if it is going to be hard for most people not to use their car anymore .
