acc .to me a student should focus more on ideas and concepts than on learning concepts because if he will know the idea & concepts he will be able to apply his learnings in his practical & normal life rather focussing on facts .by knoowing the idea & concepts , he can check & approve the practality of a learning .but in the case of facts he has to follow them blindly like a theoritical essay .also by knowing the ideas , he can use them formaking basics of other related subjects & can continue to researchs on the basis of concepts & make his own learned facts .but in case of facts , he wont be able to go out his bounded area of learned fact & continue to follow on the same & wont be able to explore & prove his facts .this will kill a student s curiousity & he will become a follower not a leader .there wont be any pace in his life .he will continue to work on same old facts .but by knowing the ideas & concepts , he can come close to the practacility of a topic & it will become a learning for his life .these ideas & concepts broaden the mind of a student to think & develope more but in case of facts , these narrowed the emrging thinking of a learning student .by learning ideas & concepts , he can lead them to a certified notion by producing practical results but in case of facts , he will not be boter to work any more on that because it will be a so called proff to him .so focus on idaes 7 conce
