i do agree with part of the statement about trying new things .when placed repeatedly in the same context , individuals tend to limit their horizon to what they know .in a business environment , this leads to two possible negative results : predictability and lack of innovation .if competitors know that one will continue to do the things it currently does without change , they can adapt and exploit the company s weakness .in the case of ibm , for instance , led by louis gertsner at the time , the company knew how to build and sell computers .the company did nt take any risk , such as engaging in software development or applications .emerging companies seized the opportunity , and that is how microsoft came to market .microsoft , led by bill gates , took risks , expanded in new segments , and became a juggernaut compared to ibm .on the other hand , i do believe also that always trying new things and taking risks can be a dangerous proposition .an example of this comes from the automotive world .jack nasser , ford s ceo at the time , wished to take ford beyond automotive and transform it to a global consumer product company .ford engaged and invested in different ventures .eventually , this proved to be a distraction to the core business , automotive .insufficient investments were made in improving its product line .and with so much focus on new ventures , ford lost sight of the market forces changing the automotive landscape .ford had stopped producing the kinds of cars and trucks consumers wanted .toyota , on the other hand , focused its business on increased sales in the automotive sector only , and closed ranks to become a dangerous and growing competitor .i do believe either option can be relevant for different people or organizations at different phases of their life .sometimes , people can use something they do well but still take risks .i would cite the example of apple , led by ceo steve jobs .while successful early on thanks primarily to its ease of use and its attractive design , apple computers became largely irrelevant when other options came to the market .recently , apple took advantage an emerging market in digital music downloads and designed the now famous ipod .the ipod leveraged apple s legendary design and ease of use and became an unsurpassed competitor .in this case , apple took something they knew how to do well ( design , ease of use ) and still took risks venturing on a completely new market ( digital music download ) beyond their core market .
