i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons .first , having broad knowledge is more usuful to make friends than specializing in one specific subject .for example , when i was a junior at keio university , private university in tokyo , japan , i took subjects only in relation with marketing that i majored .then i had only friends who was interested in marketing .but next year , when i became a senior , i took a lot of and wide range of subjects .i got many new friends who has different hobbies , knowledges and opinions , and they made my university life full of fun .as the above example clealy shows that to have broad knowledge is more usuful to make friends .second , to have broad knowledge gives people more job oppotunities .for example , when my sister graduated gakushuin university in tokyo , she looked for her job .because she learned a lot of subjects , many kind oc companies allowed her to enter those companies .so she could select the job which she wanted to enter .this experience demonstrates that to have broad knowledge gives people more job oppotunities .in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
