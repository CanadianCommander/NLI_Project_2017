that is actually a topic which is dicussed by a lot of students i know year after year .a lot of them argue that lerning facts have nothing to do with the intelligence of a person and are rarley needed in one s future job .to a certain degree i agree with their opinion because an engineer should understand that he is not allowed to use a weak material for the fondation of a house but that he rather has to choose a strong material one can build on .that is nothing one have to learn but what is rather logical .others , on the conrary argue that some facts are necessarly to understand a certain idea .my favourite example is that an engineer who finished his study will not be able to build a house or even a machine if he does not know which components exist to build or to construct them .that is why engineers have a special subject in which they learn which range of components can be used to construct a machine or to build a house .to be honnnest , i believe that there has to be something in between .i know a lot of students who learn a lot and thus know many specific facts in their fields but they do not have a structure for their knowledge .one could say : `` they can not see the forest because of the trees .they have problems to analyse a new situation because they are not openminded but caught by their thoughts .on the other hand i know quite a few students who actually do not learn at all but they still can analyse a situation properly and give a good answer .nevertheless , they lose ground as soon as a dicussion becomes more detailed .finally , i have to say that i do not agree with that answer because i believe that understanding ideas is as important as lerning facts are .to be more precisely , i believe that one have to learn facts in the beginning to understand a concept or an idea properly .that is the way i used to learn during my study and that is what i would recommend to everyone .
