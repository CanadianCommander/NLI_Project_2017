success people can be defined as people who have much knowledge and have good propectives of behavior .to be successful people , i believe that peole have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in that way , people can have more experience as they try new things and also people can try their best all the timeas as they take risks .successful people challenge new things to get own experience .if a person challenges new field , he or she will experience a new thing .thus , he or she will have more knowledge about the field .i , for example , am trying toefl test for the firt time and it is sure challenging me and pressing me .however , since i experience the test for now , i guess i could do better for the next time .it is becasue i challenge the new thing , toefl thest , and have more knowledge than before .as taking risks , people can have good prospectives of behavior while they are trying their best .when people are taking risks , they have to be careful as possible as they can and also try their best to acheive their goals or not to fail .even though people fail , they will try their best not to make the same mistake like before .for instance , if a student gets wrong on the test .on the next test , the student will learn something from what he or she got wrong and will correct later .as people challenge new field and take risks , they can have much knowledge and good personality , which mean they can success for the rest of their life .if people only do what they already know how to do well , then it will make them not learn anymore , and cause them to think they are the best .therefore , i stronly recommend people to try new things and take risks to live better quality of life .
