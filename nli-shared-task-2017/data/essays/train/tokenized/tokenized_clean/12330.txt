every people has their own lives , they can enjoy the life , or suffer their lives .as the topic says , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , that is wrong .i disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .i think old people are enjoying life in their ways .as most people know they are not healthy as younger people so we can think they are not enjoying life .enjoying life does nt mean people have to move .they can read books , listen the music , or drink tea .it depends on the personality of the person .also on the television shows how they think about old people .first , old people like to talk , it does nt matter who is it .in the book , tuesdays with morrie , morrie wants to talk to somebody , he just want someone to listen to his story .so the person who listens to his story is mitch albom , he was morrie s student once .like i said , people think old people are not enjoying their lives because they are not moving , but they are enjoying the life that they have .old people are enjoying in their way to find happiness .young people are healthy so they can go where ever they want and get everything they want .but because they are doing what they want , they ca nt be happy .the real happiness is inside of our mind .second , the happiness of enjoy life can be changed by the person s personality .for example , one of my friend does nt like to hang out with her friends or does nt like to talk to someone .but she is enjoying her life in her own way .i have no idea what does she do when she go home , may be she reads book , may be she collects pictures , or may be listens to the music .enjoying life is not like someone says , `` she does nt know how to play so she s not enjoying her life .she is suffering her life  , it does nt mean she is really suffering her life , she is enjoying her life by doing her favorite activities .third , yesterday i watched tv show `` los angles  , they had episode of old ladies in the swimming pool .people can go in the pool with topless , so those old ladies swam without top .so the worker at the hotel made them go out the pool .many people think old people are ruining their lives , but not really .they are enjoying their lives just like yound people do .therefore , everyone has their way to live their lives , to enjoy their lives .for many reasons , they are enjoying the life as same as yound people do .i hope prople in the world do nt have fence to the old people , because everybody s getting old , and we will be the old people one day .
