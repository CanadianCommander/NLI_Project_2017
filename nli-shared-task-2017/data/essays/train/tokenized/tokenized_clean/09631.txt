the idea of teaching may be described in few steps .the first step will ofcourse be the theory .to understand a given subject one should know what is already there , what exists .after that , as the second stage they will need to learn what is said about the existing case .a person becomes a student to learn , learning includes learning how to think .for instance if you are reviewing a company as it s general director , you should first know the basic things like it s field of production or expertise , capital , number of workers , its current standing in the market .after knowing what is there , you may start to create your ways of carrying the company forward .the things you have to learn in the first step are the facts .when you are ready to walk on , you start taking ideas and concepts on how develop .it is similar for a new learner student .if he or she does nt know that two times two equals four , he or she will never understand the basics of mathematics .after learning the main rules and factors they may look into ideas and concepts that have formed around the facts .so saying that a kid refusing to learn the main rules of math will be a genius in the future , under the name of open mindedness may be nonsense .if only the factors were tought to students they would probably become narrow minded people and never get to see different aspects of life .so combining the two becomes a must .while knowing the facts one should also understand the ideas about it .from this frame i would like to state that understanding ideas and the concepts is need for a student to be able to see different point of views towards a single subject , but it does nt carry a meaning without knowing what the subject is which is formed by gathering of the factors .
