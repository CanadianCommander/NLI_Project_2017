i guess a lot of people had the same problem : you are reading an article about an impressive building ( like the pyramids ) and you do not understand how it was build and hot it was able to resist all the time .in case you understand the idea or concept of the building , you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings .in addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examble by building higher and better buildings .also you keep the facts better in your mind .in this essay i want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas .firstly , you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea .in case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim .just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea .secondly , you are able to improve the concept .in case you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable .just think of the eiffel tower which had for the first time an iron scelleton .people transfered this knowledge to other buildings and increased the size step by step !lastly , by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the facts .you are then able to understand why diesel engines need less fuel than engines with gas because they use different technics .from my point of view it is really important to understand the concept of something .with this understanding you are able to transfer the knowledge to other products or to improve the concept for example by building better products .also you can easier remind on the facts by understanding the concept .
