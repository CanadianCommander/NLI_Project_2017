teaching has arisen debates that are still today difficult to avoid when one has to deal with education , learning or training .one of these debates could be summarize by the following statement :` it is more important for students to undertand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .somehow , this debate recalls the fight which opposed montesquieu and montaigne during the french renaissance on education : the first one willing a ` full brain  for students while for the latter prevailed a ` well made and shaped brain  for them .it is , i think , of a high importance for students to understand and to have a very clear and precised conception of ideas or concepts they deal with at school .the more you understand , the more you will be likely to explain to other people the subject you are currently working on .consequently , the basis of any learning should lean on a good and clear understanding of ideas and concepts .indeed , facts are just a matter of memorizing , which is not a proof of a good understanding , hence , it is possible to know by heart the important dates of the wwii without being able to seize the meaning of this particular strategy nor the consequences of that battle .facts must then be secondary for students .fact , which does not mean that they are unnecessary or useless .as i said above , facts are secondary which means that they have their importance in the learning process .students must rely on facts to better understand ideas or concepts they are dealing with .for instance , it is impossible to have a good comprehension of marxism or african decolonisations in only bearing on ideas or concepts .facts are here to confirm or infirm theories .facts are helpful in the sense that they provide a pragmatic approach to something which has so far only being taken into a theoretical way .a good combination between concepts and facts must thus help students to have a global understanding in what they deal with .
