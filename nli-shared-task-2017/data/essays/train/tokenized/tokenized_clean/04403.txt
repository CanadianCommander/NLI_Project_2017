the issue of car number is very important because of environmental espects that are involved in this problem .on the one hand , we can thing that in twenty years there will fewer cars in use than today because of the limited energy sourves such as petroleum .on the other hand , people which consider developping country , or former developping country such as china or india can support the idea that the number of cars will increase .in my opinion , the number of cars will decrease in developped country as in europ or north america but will increase in newly developped country as china .first of all , we have to condider that the whole world is changing because of the scarcity of energy that will be an very important issue in the next twenty years .actually , it will involve high prices for gazoline for example .for instance , people which does not need long travel by car will use other way to travel such as bike because cars will be too expensive .then , we know the countries that use a lot of cars are the developped countries and now , new developped countries are coming and its inhabitants are going to be able to buy cars .thus , car number can increase a lot during the next twenty years .finally , my viewpoint is that there will be high difference in the car consumption between developped countries and countries like china or india where the number of cars is sharply increasing .moreover , number of cars in more little asian countries is growing too .for instance , it is a new thai problem in bangkok .to conclude , it is difficult to answer and predict the car consumption in the worls that involve a lot of phenomena like energy availability or country developping but environmental problems are linked to car number and some law or regulation about environment may decrease the quantity of cars during the next twenty years .
