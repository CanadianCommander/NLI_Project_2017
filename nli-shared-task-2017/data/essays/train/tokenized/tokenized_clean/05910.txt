although i personally would be more than happy if this statement would be true , i can not agree with it .three major aspects make me disagree with the statement , firstly the world population in general and secondly greed for material goods , the idea of personal freedom and independent traveling closely connected to the idea of having an own car .thirdly the car industries have to be taken into account who are not likely to be very willing to earn less money by producing less cars .since the beginning of the industrialization more and more goods have been produced for more and more people living on the earth .in the next 20 years the world population will by no means decline , europe and north america may face this problem but the rest of the world will face a population increase .more people on the earth are likely to equal more cars being around in the next twenty years and beyond .at the same time people ask for more and more goods to have a more comfortable life and to prove themselves and their neighbours who they are and up to where they have made it .having a car is not only due to actual needs of having one but also is a symbol of status for many people ( who then are likely to have more than just one car ) .and , one need not forget that a car actually is very practical , not only for a big family going on holidays or doing shopping but also for every individual because one does not have to live according to public transport schedules .in areas less populated than e.g. germany or the netherlands there are many places one would hardly reach without a car and as people tend to have the wish for unlimited access cars will often help them to fullfil this need .lots of countrys like again e.g. germany earn lots of their money via the car indstries and not only would there have to be huge changes done to change this but maily would it need enough force to actually want a fundamental change and at he moments this , from my point of view unfortunately , can not be seen .my arguments do not only apply to the question of fewer or more cars , i thing it is easily applied to all kinds of modern technological goods like computers , televisions , mobiles and so on and i tstrongly believe that we have to be very careful to produce not only more and more of this goods but that we have to understand that fewer cars , laptops , machines of all kind , as suggested in the statement would actualy often be much better for all of us .
