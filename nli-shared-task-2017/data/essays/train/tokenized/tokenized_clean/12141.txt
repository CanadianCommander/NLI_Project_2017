i certainly dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .if a person wants to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are .enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is , however ; it depends on how the person is .being sociable , appreciating what you have , and have the positive way of thinking are all characteristics a person contains but it differs in people , what kind of person they are .being a sociable person has a major affect on a person .if a person dislikes being around people then he wont be able to enjoy life because he/she are not seeing people of different cultures that entertain you .this unsociable person would end up being alone not wanting to interact with the outside word .one of the major reasons that would make a person enjoy his life is appreciating what he/she has .if a person does not do so he would nt be living that of a nice life .for ex : if a poor girl is friends with a rich girl and this poor girl wants to wear and have what the rich girl has the that is a big problem because the girl would not be able to afford certain things .by not appreciating what she has she would suffer alot and would nt really enjoy life .if a person wants to really enjoy life he/she would no matter who he/she really was .sitting around thinking of all the bad things would just depress the person more and more and not allow him/her enjoy there life .therefore a person shoudl just live his/her life and enjoy it .in conclusion all people would enjoy life no matter how old they are .if the person wants to enjoy life then this person would enjoy it no matter what .
