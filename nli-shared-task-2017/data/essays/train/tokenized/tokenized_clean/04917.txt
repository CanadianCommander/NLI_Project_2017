in the world we live in today , education is one of the most valuable assets a person can have .if we where to be living in the 19th century , it would be better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific thing .during those ages , specialization was not very important .it was more important if one had a broad knowledge of many subjects .one can see that for example , taylorism , which was basically a new form of working in plants ( it was based in speciallization of workers and a good management so that workers would nt loose time ) , was only taken into account during the first part of the twentieth century with the arrival of the production line invented by henry ford .before that , people did nt take into account specialization , because there was no need to .there were no procesess involving specific actions or functions .nevertheless , we are not living in the 19th centruy .we are already in the twenty first , where a carrer is very important .the more one studies , the more probable is that one will do well in their future .the world is becoming every day more and more competitive .every year , there are millions of people who go into the labour market , and compete between themselves for a better job .the only way to differentiate a potential good job applicant form a bad , one is the studies they have .if one applicant has studied a lot , and the other has not , it is more probable that the one who has better studies will get the gob .besides that , there is the subject of specialization in specific areas .nowadays , firms are demanding very specific kinds of workers .workers who have specialized in very specific areas , in which other worker would not be able to perform the task .this type of demand for specific workers is becoming greater and greater every day .this is why one would think that , living in the competitive world that we live today , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
