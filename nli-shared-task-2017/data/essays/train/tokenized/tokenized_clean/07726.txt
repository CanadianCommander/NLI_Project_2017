i think we should study towo questions te make response to the subject :why today products seems tobe better that they really are ?and is the increase in advertisements explain this fact ?first i will make a little history and the evolution of marketing .first the productions was local and not industrial they were a little number of products on the market and to sell it was very easy to sell them the offer was more important than demand .in a second time at the beginning of the industrial revolution , when the demand egalize the offer , all custumers could fine on the market the same product one exaple is the ford t the same car , same color for every one .a third evolution of the industrial revolution is to propose , on the market , for a same product which have the same function , differents options .for example a car with a choice of differents colors .so in this phase of the evolution people could satisfie also primary needs and also desire wich is new abotu the patterns of buying something .maslow with his famous pyramid explain and illustrate the different needs and desire .the technologies of indistrials production have change the market and today we have an offer more important tha the demand and the primary needs or the original function of a products are today less important than the desire of make an acquisition of a particular type of car .for example if you buy a bmw car today you also buy a certain range in the society .when people were buying the ford t they were buy a product which permit to go from one point to another and it was nt a for distinctions from other people .in conclusion i think advertising contribute to clarifie and communicate on the desire wich is offer by the product to the person .the quality bqsed on the primary function is secondary .
