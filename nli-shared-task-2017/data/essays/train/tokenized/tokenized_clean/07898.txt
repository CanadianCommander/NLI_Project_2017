according to what is illustrated , i agree that fewer cars will be in use than there are today .almost every evidnece is implying for such occasion where the economic , pollution , politics . ..all such situation will have an influence on such phenomenon .the first reason , many studies and reaserches emphasize that the exceeding number of cars is promoting the increase in the greenhouse event .so , as a challenge for such case am sure that many government will introduce new laws thats will extremelly restric from the expanding of such danger event .despite the advantage of cars , in the near future we will be under tremendous challenge due to disadvantage of cars on environment and social life , so we must search about something substitute such danger transportation .furthermore , civils all over the world will be unable to fullfill their cars with the needed fuel due to the increase in prices of such material .this future aspect will force governments to rasie the prices of fuel , simply from the decline in the amounts of such substance in its origin places , as such event is occuring from the excess supplying and the carelessness for the accuarte foundation of such materail .am not stating my view , as such facts are being implyed by many scientists .finally , the overuse of such transportation way and the increase of population around the earth lead to a miserable and conflict operation in human movements , here governments will interfer to decline such overuse and put laws that reinforce such duty .anyone can touch the evidences for the restriction of such familiar man-made .thus we will be forced to leave away such transportation and will try to find the new technological invention .
