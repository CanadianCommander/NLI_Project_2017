many people have different way to travel , some people travel individually , some prefere to travel as a couple , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. in my opinioin i prefere to travel in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason :first , travelling in a group is better , more secure and more organised .when you travel in a group you do not have to worry about an thing , you pay the trip cost , you will have the trip schudle in advance , so you can organise your time .also lling in a group wil give you a chance to travell with your friends and you can make a lot of new friends .second , the organization and security of your trip , suppose your trip is going to egypt , from the begging your tour guide will be with you , stating from booking the hotel , and will organizes your trip to see e most attractive places in egypt , such as the pyramides , the nile river , sephenx the egyptian museum and many differnent places in the country you will visit .third , travelling in a group led by a tour guide has many avantages . .if we come to security , the tour guide will be responsible for your safety .if you got sick he wll help you to get treatment if you lost your mony or your luggage he wll help ou to get them back .lastly , travelling in a group will help you to be in touch with different people from different countries and fom different backgrounds .where you can make a lot of new frienships which can be benificial to you in the future .in cinclusio , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveiling as an individual for the reason i menthoined above , which include organization security ami
