the manufacturers are using advertisements to mark their products .they are using new techniques which will attract many people .thus increasing their market .according to me i do nt agree to the perception that , if the advertisement is good , the product is always good and reliable .advertisement is a source used to make people familiar with a product .but it will not judge the quality of a product .due to spending more on the advertisement , the producers are not able to invest money to increase the quality of the product , decrease the price of the product and icrease the quantity of the product .recently there are so many problems identified with the use of prducts like coke and pepsi .the manufractures are spending more money to advertise and they are also investing lot on celebrities to make them their product s ambessedors .but it is found that these products are causing daingerous effcts on the health of the people .toxic substances are used in these products which cause serious health effects .they also deteriorate bones in adults and cause growth hazards in children .children are more attracted by the celebrites .another thing about advertisements is that , than to spend money in producing an attractive advertisement , companies should invest more on improving the quality of product that they are producing .also buy spending more on advertisement there is no economical benefit for the consumer , in order to attract more consumers , the price of the product should be reduced .also if the quantity is increased then more middle class people will be attracted to that product .so in my opinion the advertisements are sophasticated sources which seems to make products better than they are actually .
