each and every new inniovation in human history started to be used at first with a decreasing manner and then their usage has becomed more and more wide as they meet the new facility .moreover , people has made interesting comment on their use among the common people .for instance , one of the owner of a hollywood studio in the first years of the television , he claimed that people would not spend a time in front of a box every night .however , in time it has become an inevitable element of one house .in fact , there are other several technologies that did not take any credit first and , afterwards , they are the important part of our living .one of them , that i would like to discuss , is the cars that we use everyday for different reasons .thus it is not logical to think that they will decrease in use .as the examples in our daily lives show , their use is constantly increasing due to several reasons .today , technology develops regularly and everyday we see different versions of the same car , which is supposed to be just a 2 and half tones of iron compounded by four wheels .for instance , there different marks in the market .when it is asked which car you would like to have , there can be various answers to this question ranging from the mercedes to the ford .these new versions and marks encourage people to purchase a newer car even if this person has already one .in addition to that , with the fast developing technology , the automobiles are produced more and more cheaper .hence , the people having a little money spent can go and buy a car with respect to his or her budget .indeed , there are consumers credit offered by banks in order to make this process more easier .as far as all these are concerned , it is possible that in the future , the number of cars will double instead of diminishing .apart from the technology in producing automobiles and the bank credits , the governments continously improves the infrasturucture of their countries .although their primary concern is to increase the economic transaction wtihin the country and with the other countries , this helps to individualize the transportation .for instance , in my country , the public transportation is like a torture .the public buses are full of the people both standing and sitting .also , it is not possible to go from one side of the city to other side by taking one bus .moreover , the municipality of the city continously improves the roads of the city , rather increasing number of buses and making new combuination of routes .consequently , when i see that driving my own car to my destination are relatively better than utilising the buses , i prefer to drive to the place that i wanto to reach .thus , today in my city , there is an increase of cars serving for only one person .in conclusion thi
