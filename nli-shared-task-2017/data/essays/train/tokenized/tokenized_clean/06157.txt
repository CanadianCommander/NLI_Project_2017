in my view , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acafeimic subjects .of course there are some disadvantages of broad knowledge because it means a greater investment of time and tuition .howvever , there are even more compelling advantages that i want to explain .i think broad knowledge is effecticely for many areas of the life .first , you have a common core of knowledge with other students .if you are an international student you need to communicate in many parts of life .broad knowledge makes it easier to have an intellectual exchange with other people .in opposite , specialization leads to a narrow view of things .this people are not informed about a lot of things so they can not share their knowlegde with other people .an additional point is that broad knowledge increases the opportunities of careers that you can choose from during life .from the beginning of their studies , people often do not know what they want to make in their futures .therefore , broad knowlegde of many academic subjects offers more career opportunities than specialization .perhaps , it helps or shows you a direction in what their job should be in the future .of course , people often change their jobs in their entire lives , maybe because of their own decision or other circumstances .in this case , broad knowledge can find another interesting job .finally , you get more opportunities for leisure time .this means , that you are interested in a lot of things because broad knowledge provides a lot of aspects of life .later , educated people , when they are older , they will retire their jobs so they can spend their time on their hobbies that they have developed during their studies of many academic subjects .in short , i think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first , you get exposure to a lot of things .second , you can choose between many careers .finally , you get a broad view of leisure time .
