i do nt think young people enjoy life more that older people do but in fact i neither think the contrary .in my `` short  beginning life i met lots of differents people from all ages .i met young people like me who wanted to discover everything .they wanted to test new sensations , discovered new cultures , go out every night to meet people and make parties .when you are young and you want to do that you can !but when you are young and you want to jump from a plane to experiment thrill of falling you meet an older instructor .when you go to the best discotheques you learn that the owner is 50 years old .when you drive fast on the highway and think `` i am the ( stupid and crazy ) king of the highway  you see an `` old  man behind you in a bmw / mercedes / audi car that drives faster than you .i think most people thinks that when you are young you can make lots of enjoyable things because of your health , strenght , young mentality , freedom etc and when you get older you have more contraints .but in fact i know people older than me that show me that you can enjoy life if you have children , if you ca nt run very fast and jump everywhere .there is not an only way to have fun and all people have there own way to entertain .to conclude , i think you can enjoy life while you are not so seak that you have to lie all day long on a bed .it do nt depends on your age or the money you have .enjoying life is a way ...of life
