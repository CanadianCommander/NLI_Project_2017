i agree with the statement above because i think that humanity in general has beneficiated from men willing to risk what they previously achieved in order to find something new or more valuable .if some scientists would nt have put under scrutiny the discovery of the past we probably would nt have increased our knowledge in medicine or science in general .when galileo galilei said that our planet hearth was round and not flat like everyone else was thinking had everything tho lose and in fact he had to retreat his affirmation in order to save his life from the accusition of heresy .if we would nt have question our knowledge we probably would nt have discovered all those things that we are taking now for granted .even those things will probably came under scrutiny in a not long future giving us the chance to improve what we know or we think of knowing .the ability of putting ourself under judgment and been up for new challenges is a great gift .it s never too late to learn something new and ampliate our knowledge .that it will only give us more as a person .we should never lose our curiosity of when we were child , our brain will never stop to learn if pushed in doing so .there is nothing wrong with failure as long as we are going to learn from our mistakes and put them into use for a successful purpose .that s why
