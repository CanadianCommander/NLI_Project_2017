i do not agree to the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first and foremost i believe that when you travelling in a group with a tour guide you have to make a lot of compromises and are restricted to the sites that are covered by the tour guide .these sites that are covered by the tour guide may not necessarily be the sites that i may be interested in .also you may not be able to spend enough time at a certain site if you desired to do so .secondly the loss of privacy and freedom when you are travelling in a group would kill the enjoyment of the trip .when i travel for pleasure the last thing i want to do is to stick to a schedule set out by the travel group or the tour guide .when you are travelling independently you can set your own agenda and can be completely flexible about it without affecting anybody else .thirdly in this day and age of internet , i do not feel the need to rely on a tour guide for information about any place .i can get all the information about a place that i intend to travel to , on the internet and can then make a decision on what places interest me the most and than plan out my trip accordingly .lastly there is a general perception that group travel works out cheaper financially than if you travelled independently .i do not agree with this idea .with the availability of several internet based travel agents its almost always possible to get great travel deals on travel , hotels etc any time of the year to almost any place in the world .for the above reasons i firmly believe that travelling in a group with a tour guide is not the best way to travel to any destination .
