today , people use their car for everything .short distance as well as longer ones .moreover , people do really enjoy their car , we can see it every morning and night when there is a lot of traffic , they prefer staying in their car to using public transports .so they love them and they take care of them as a precious object .nevertheless , i strongly believe that in twenty years , the number of car in the road will sharply decreased , not because people will be willing to give up their car but because they will no longer have the choice .first of all , the price of gas .we re experiencing a new era , where the price of petroleum reaches a level never reach before .the increase of the gas price is badly and harshly felt by the population .petroleum become more and more expensive meanwhile people become poorer and poorer mostly because of unemployement .so that , gas becaume a luxuary good and fewer persons can offer it .soon , only rich people could offer it .moreover , environmemtal concerns become more and more important .indeed , polution has rech a rate never reached before .for instance , france during summer period , when it s warmer , has to ask its citizens not to take their car in big cities such as paris and to take public transport or bikes if they have to move , or even move by foot , because the polution rate is too high .if they have to drive it is recommemded to take more tham one passenger inside the car .the french authorities have to rely on the environmental conscious of the citizens .nevertheless , as the polution rate is not suppose to decrease in the near future and as the climate is suppose to be warmer than it use to be , i am sure that people wo nt be able to use their car as often as they would like to .for all these reasons , even if people are not willing to give up their car , they will no longer have the choice in twenty years .
