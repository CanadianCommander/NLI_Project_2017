in my personal experience , i have traveled both in a group led by a tour guide , and in a group with out a tour guide .i think that one of this experince is better and fun .next i will comparate this two situations .if you travel whit a tour guide , then you do nt need to search maps , itineraires and local information , because the tour guide will have all the things that you migth need on a trip , this is a possitive sigth of traveling with a guide .but also travel with a guide means that you are not owner on you schedule , because you need to follow the itinerary of travel agency .for example , when i went to brasil with my class , i had to do all the things that the tour guide tell us to do , so we ca nt decide wich restorant pick for lunch , or with pub to go on nigths .on the other side of the coin , if you travel by yourself , with out a tour guide , then you can do all the things that you want to do , for example , if you wish to sleep all the afternoon on the beach on rio de janeiro , you can do it ; or if you want to spend one entierely day on just one place , you can do it too .but such as the first position ( travel with a guide tour ) , travel with out a guide implies some problems , for example : where can i change money ? , where can i register in ? , how much should i pay for a suvenir ? .in my personal opinnion , i think that travel in grup with out a guide is the best way to travel .this mean that you can program your own trip , and you dont need to follow an schedule .when i have traveled with out the led of a tour guide , i ve had more funn .
