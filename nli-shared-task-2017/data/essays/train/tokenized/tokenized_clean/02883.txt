the provided topic states that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .i disagree with the statement as it is my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people .nowadays , we live in a world that is economically driven and requires good planning and wise decision making .due to their wide experiences in life , older people are able to plan wisely in order to enjoy their lives .for example , older people will plan their outings , vacations , activities , and events more effectively than young people .for a vaction , they plan where they wanted to go and what they wanted to see and how much the cost would be .this way they will enjoy all aspects of their vacation and not miss important events or sightings .whilst , if they went on a vaction , younger people would not plan as well and eventually miss out a lot of important activities and sightings .consequently , with their good planning , older people would only spend mony on what they wanted to see and enjoy .whilst younger people would run out of money and usually regret some of the things they did not see in their vacation .in addition , older people would have more money to enjoy life with than younger people .older people are more established in their careers and therfore more financially sound and actually save have saved their money to enjoy their lives at this stage .whilst younger people may not have as much money to enjoy life with as some of them may be in school or not employed .some of them may have not even thought of a career at this point in their lives .on the other hand , there are always exceptions as there are younger people who do plan well , are established in their careers , and are financially well off .but generally speaking , due to their life experiences , older people plan well , established in their fields , and are financially more sound than younger people .
