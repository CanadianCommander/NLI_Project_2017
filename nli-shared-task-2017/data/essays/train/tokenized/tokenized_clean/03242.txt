the question whether to have a broad knowledge of many acedemics subjects or to specialise in one specific subject is a very arguable and can lead to many a heated discussions .in my opinion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to just have expertice in one .according to me , the practical value of a person increases when he know about various other subjects apart from his major .this makes him a lot more versatile and flexible .he can take care of a lot of things without external assistance and thus can prove to be an asset .moreover , in todays world , one has to be aware of a lot of things to make himself as well his family prosper .for example , a doctor by profession has to have a basic knowledge of electricity and safely measures of electrical appliances to safely operate the appliances .if he does not pay enough attention to this , and only be expert at his profession then he may unintentionally cause an accident .also for example , a chartered accountant needs to know the basics of first aid in order to administer the same when the need arises .in the same way a contruction worker needs to know the basics of taxation where he can save a dollar more .hence for a comfortable living in todays world , one needs to have a practical knowledge of a variety of subjects .seeing in the practical aspect , this opinion is reflected in the corporate world also .we dont have a lot of experts of scientific or civil fields .the reason for this is the amount of extra effort that they have to put in to become an expert .to further explain this , the time when a student starts learning the contents of a subject , i believe , he is not mature enough to decide whether this is what he actually wants to expertise in .he is unaware of the other subjects and possibilities that lay ahead in them .for making a sound decision , one has to spend some time in knowing the subjects and then deciding .in we take this approach practically then , by the time a student gets aquainted to all the subjects his learning time has lapsed biologically and he thus becomes jack of all but master of none .but there are a few exeptional ones who do pursue specialised education and become specialists in their fields .hence i feel that , the choice should afterall be of the student to decide between master or jack .but given a choice , i would prefer to be a jack rather than a master .
