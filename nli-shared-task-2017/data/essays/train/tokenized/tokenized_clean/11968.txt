i neither agree , nor disagree with that statement .i think actually both is important .let me give a personal story that helped me getting a conclusion towards this question .the problem is , if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideologically fundament among the facts he knows about , he will probably always have big problem to convince anyone else for a project or an idea .the modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of fact-knowledge and who in fact `` did not red the newspapers  .both cases are nothing to follow after .but , to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence , both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact dont exist that way and i only use them to illuminate my point of view .for example the former german bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder was often called a big actor , a pretender .a lot of people where concinced , that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programms from his party or important parlamentary decisions .and in fact , i often thaught similary - until i met him one day .it was a rainy sunday and some freinds of mine and me where walking through the bars of berlin .than mr schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked if we knew where the toilet was .it followed what always follows , we drank , we laughed and we where talking about politics , as soon as he was back from the restroom .but my personally lesson from that meeting was - if somebody is able to make a successfull carreer , where ever that happens , he needs to understand fundamentall ideas and concepts at first - and than he has to know facts .mr schroeder impressed us all absolutely because of his the huge flood of facts , that so called `` pretender  could tell us about .
