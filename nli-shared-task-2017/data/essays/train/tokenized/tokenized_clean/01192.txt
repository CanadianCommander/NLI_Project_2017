in physics , teachers nowadays try to teach their students the so called physical sense .it means to understand , to predict a phenomenon without filling blackboards of equations .if we zoom out of the scientific fields , we can compare , on one hand , the understanding of ideas and concepts to the physical sense , and on the other hand , the facts to the equations which describe the phenomenon .both are intrisiquently linked .a good scientific can explain the most difficult phenomenon to anybody , as well as he can demonstrate a theory .in history , facts have their own importance and significance .they keep ideas and concepts in the real world , avoiding people to get far from reality .facts are pillars , whereas ideas can change .what makes nazis different from any racist and populist groups ?the extermination camps .on one edge , we have ideals that have to be condamned , on the other side , we have pieces of evidence , that once , democratic countries let nazi germany killing millions of people just because they were jew .if a history teacher wants to present the horror of the extermination of jewish people , he can not talk only about nazi ideals .he must mentionning auschwitz .and auschwitz is a fact .ideas and concepts can be defined as frames , whereas facts are details .details make the difference .on a teaching point of view , is it easier to learn facts or to learn concepts ?facts give the concept a practical substance , making it easier to reach .i think it is as important to learn concepts as to learnf facts
