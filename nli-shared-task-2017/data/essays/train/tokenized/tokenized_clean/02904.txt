do you agree that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ?i think it is true .people will always success because they like to try anything .they always get new things when they try .if peop do not try , they alwaysfirst of all , there is always not only one way to solve a problem .you always can use different way to solve a problem if you want .maybe what you do is not the best way , or what you made is not the best thing .you need to try .every time your trying is also a lerning .you try more , and you learn more .secondly , why people is better than animals ?because people can think .people create things by their thinking .if people do not like to think , what different between peopl and animals ?for the same way , people who try new things and take risk than only doing what they already know will always go fowoard .they always can create new things , and everything is the way to success .in the conclusion , why people can be successful ?because they have many methods to lead them ten to success , and those methods come from their thinks .only when you creat a new ideal , you can do better than other people .try to tink much , and you will get much .do nt always do the thing by the same way .trying will lead you to see more thlngs .
