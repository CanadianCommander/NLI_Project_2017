broader knowedge for a broader world ?in my opinion , there is no denying adults need to be aware of various issues , especially in a globalized system , because individual way-of-leaving influences global phenomena .schools have a great role to play in order to give people this knowledge , then people have to keep it in their mind their whole life along .first , let s briefly summarize what is a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .it is an education which gives keys to understand the world in which he lives to the student .history , mathematics , languages , economics , philosophy , let s call them all the scientific ways explored by scholars for years to understand matters of common concern .terefore , teachers are greatly responsible for children to become open-minded adults , or on the contrary narrow-minded people .indeed , teachers help children to learn the world is not limited to what they see .they can guide them throughout flows of pictures medias publish every day .because people need to learn early to deal with huge amounts of informations they daily get .and school is the only area were every child can receive the means to be able to defend himself against wrong or biased information .these means broadly consist in strong knowledge of various topics .then , adults will be able to stand critically about informations they receive .as a matter of fact , if they have learnt china is a communist regime , they will not trust every information published by chinese medias .the same thing about advertising ; thanks to a comprehensive education , with hisotry and economics , but also mathematics , he will be able to better chose the products he need .he ll fail less easily to notice lies .for all these reasons , i think it is more important to have broad culture .nonetheless , it does not mean specialised scholars ar not needed , on the contrary they play an essential role in progress .
