i basicly think that young people have enough time to helping their communities .it should be understood that the young are the major sector of the community .if the community , for example , offered schooling and public services to the young , then the young would respond and cooperate with their community .they take part in public ceremonies , social campaigns and many other assisting services .this , of course , would create a mode of trust , confidence and cooperation between the young and the community .generally , the young people are of highly percentage of students and less of workers .in other words , most of them are literate and they recognize the need of their community for them .i really appreciate the young who have a mutual integriation between their efforts and the community s .they form a one body where they find each others  needs , and it helps solve their problems and to share the same experience under the same medium .one may wonder where is the young people s time running out if they do nt give enough time to helping their communities .in fact , i do nt find any excuse to secure those who pretend that they have no enough time to be dedicated to their community .actually , living in a community is not a tragedy of the commons .benefits must be common among all the young as well as the old .finally , the young people are the core of all communities , and the communities should serve them and give them the most opprtunities available to develop their skills and potentials .in this way , i think , the other side - the young people - will take care of their community and share its experience cooperatively .this woluld make the young give much of their time to helping their communities .
