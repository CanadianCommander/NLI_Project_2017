the ideas and concepts came from the facts .i somewhat agree with this idea that is important to students understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .in my life i use to work on both of them .i understand the ideas and concepts .however , i learn facts from many stories .to understand the ideas we have to think and discuess the ideas that have many types .for example , it is easy to anyone of us to make ideas about anything , but on other hand it is diffcult to him to make facts .the facts are learned and existed in our life by the past experience and intentions .but the question , that is always occuring to us , how do we make idea and how can the idea be fact ?many students and professors have a great talent to make an idea .i remember when i was undergraduate student , i spent two hours with my professor in the university to discuess the idea that my professor gave our class .two hours i spent to understand what is his idea focus on ?and what is the goals from the idea ?the idea was about business soluations to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city .it is provided many aspects and aims .according to the example , i like to understand that i am interesting to know more about , but sometimes i do nt care about some ideas that do nt make sense .i use to convert the idea to fact by looking on the internet for facts about thing that has related to idea .in conclison , students are different some of them like to learn t but others like to understand the ideas .we learn from facts that is sure .and we learn from our mistakes .but the idea should be understoo
