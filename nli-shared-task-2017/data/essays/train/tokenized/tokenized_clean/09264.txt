the purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy a specific product .the business world especially marketers thinks that it does not really necessary to tell the truth , if you could sell something .first of all , advertisements are one of the most important tools of marketing .their first and for most purpose is to attract people and persuade them to buy .the goal of advertisements is not to tell the truth .they can tell to truth but it does not mean that it is not just a way of marketing .it is still tring to convince people to prefer particular thing to others .people usually buy things which they saw on advertisements , and usually they get disappointed with the result .even though people think that they are buying the same thing , the reality is that the product is always exegirated in advertisements and it will be worse than people thought .the basic example for this will be hamburgers .when i go to a fast food restaurant , i saw lots of pictures of hamburgers , and they look really big .when i buy one , i always find it to small to saticify , because the pictures convince me that they will be really big .however , one of the easiest way of getting information about a product is advertisements .before buying something people want to learn more about it .they do not want to buy which they really do not need .people see advertisements in everywhere so they do not have to spend too much effort to obtain an information .altough advertisements are the easiest way to learn something about a product to make a desicion , people should reconsider every detail that they heared from or saw on an advertisement if it can be true or not .they should be aware of the reality that the ads are for convincing people , not for telling the truth .
