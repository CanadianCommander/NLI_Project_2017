i really agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .advertising emphasizes the qualities of a product , or simply change it .few cases exist of a product being advertised as the worst one in order to be soldemphasizing the qualities of a product is the natural way people working in the advertising industry use to sell their products .this is based on the assumption that the better the product appears , the most likely people are be to buy it .imagine that an advertisement shows a car which is just the reflect of the reality , that is to say , going to the car repair after breakdown , buying expensive gas to make it run : people would not buy it as the disadvantages of having car would be too important .that is why advertisements insist on the mechanical performances of cars such as the acceleration rate or the low consumption , which are positive value for people , but highly biased .in general the reality is far lower than the advertisememt .the advertised car is being driven in an ideal world in straigth line with no traffic jams .that is so surprising when you are finally aware of the real consumption rate in our today s life .adverstisements can also tells false arguments in order to give the product a defined image that fits people s needs .it sells qualities that are not the ones of the product .for example fast-food restaurant advertise on the nutritional qualities of their products althougth this kind of food is recognized to contain high rates of grease and sugar .so in general this is sure that most advertisements improve the product itself because this is the aim of advertisements .i know one case of a product being sold as the worst one : this is called `` ugly fruits  which are fruits with no standardized shapes like those we find in supermarkets .they do not look good .but even behind this there is a positive and emphasized message : uglier the fruits are , the more natural and healthier , even if those fruits have no more nitrituinal virtues .even ugliness could make seem product better .
