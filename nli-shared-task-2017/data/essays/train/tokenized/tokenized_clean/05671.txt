there are many types of teaching style in school .some teachers emphasize to understand idea and concepts , but others emphasize just fact and result .both of teaching styles might have adventages .however , i think the statement that unerstanding idea and concept is more important than learning facts .before we know a result , we have to know procedure , and we have to understand ideas and concepts to know procedure .in korea , they emphassize fact and result .we just learn how to approch the facts and results .we do nt know why some facts do that .we just know the facts .we just memorize the fact .for example , when i learned about multipling , i just memorize the facts as 2 multiply by 2 is 4 , 2 multiply by 3 is 6 .it also happened in high school because students in korea have to take a korean s.a.t for going to university .korean s.a.t questions want to just fact .in contrast , in the united states , they emphasize to understand ideas and concepts .students in the united states learn mathmatics less than korean students , but they learn why the fact happens .it s different .students in korea learn `` how  , but students in the united states learn `` why  .a friend of mine , for example , came to the united states when he was a high school students .at that time , he was good and high grade about mathmatics in his school in the united states because he previously learned in korea .however , when he went to a university , and he also studied mathmatics , he could nt very well rather another american studens because he did nt understand the ideas and concepts , also he did nt know procedure .it is not only mathmatics .so , i think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important and a kind of best learning skills .
