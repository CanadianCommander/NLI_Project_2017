nowadays , a lot of businesses are growing and developing .as far as business is concerned , people who have started a new business want to succeed .in my opinion , the people who want to earn a lot of money have to try new things because of following reasons .first of all , if one has a new idea , it would provide people interested .the most important thing of success in business or earning a lot of money begins with people s interests .people do not interest what they already know .in contrast , upon seeing a new thing , they interest about the thing and buy it .thus , an interesting idea or new thing which are never known to people could succeed one s businesssecond and last , the world is changing rapidly and variety .one who knows how to do well and does the same thing , he/she is never going to be succeeded because the world is moving fast and requires new thing everyday .for example , one of the camera company ` canon  has changed new way on digital camera .the cameras of canon has ` cmos  censor which is the heart of camera and in the past , ` cmos  is the worst and cheapest chip .canon , however , has developed this censor new way that is totally different way than before .` nikon  , one of the rival company of canon , was tha best of camera in the film area .in contrast , nikon uses ` ccd  which is sharper than cmos but expensive .the censor has given from ` sony  , hence , it is expensive and it is not their own technology .through canon s new trying and developing its new censor become the best camera in the digital camera .in the past , film is the only method of taking picture , however , the world photography market has changed by digital and canon tried a new technology and finally succeed .in conclusion , the world needs new things and people need new things as well .therefore , if one wants to succeed , i would suggest two things .be a creative to make a new idea and try a new way to succeed .
