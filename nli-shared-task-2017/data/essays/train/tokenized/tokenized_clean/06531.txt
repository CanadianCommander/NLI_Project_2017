since the televison has come to exist in our society , our way of thinking and our needs are changing with it or at least the tv make us believe that we need caertain things that we would never buy if we would nt be bombed wiyh it for thw hole day .in the last years tv developed very much and commercials are always more in our today life .most of tv broadcasts rely on the money that are provided by the commeracials showed on their cahnnels .of course companies of the products shown on tv need to make as much money as possible , and this is why they tend to make their products seem much better than they really are .advertisements are not only selling you a product .they are selling you a product , a fantasy , and they are also sending you a message .the primary goal of products companies is certainly to sell their products so they of course show you the utilty of the object in question , providing you the informations about it .on tv the time is so short and limited that they can avoid to spend too much time to show you the quality of the product .consequently the quality really decraese also in the reality .one of the parts that obviously the companies care about the most , is the fantsy that they are selling you , infact , in the world of today where most of things are fantasies , unreal , or abstract the tv ends to be our reality .at least the one we believe to .with their advertisements the compnaies that whenever you will be using that specific product the commerical will come to your mind and depicts the devices in a better way .the third aspect imprtant in tv commercials is given by the fact that companies send you a message through their advertisement .they tell you that if you use that specific kind of cell phone or you wear that particular kind of shirt you will be cooler , or more self confident or more relaxed .they practically tell you the way you will feel using that product , and that of course affect people s mind .nowadays televison certainly make products seem much better than they really are .this is regulated by the law of the televison thatis basically that people like to be tricked and beshown unreal things
