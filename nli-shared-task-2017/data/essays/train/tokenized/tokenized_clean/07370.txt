i strongly agree that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .to support and explain the stated point we have many reasons and lets review them logically .the main point which hold the statement that in twenty years there would be lesser cars than used today would be since there is a drastic decrease in the natural fuel being used , such as peteroleum products .to support this point the recent survey conducted by national geographic expedition and their study shows that these natural reservers like peteroleum would last for not more than another 30 years , if the same rate of usage is continued .this study also involves the different peteroleum products being used as fules , these include diesel , petrol , gassoline , lpg ( liqufied peteroleum gass ) and other minor fules .we should also include the case of using natural solar power , or nuclear fuel , but at the present rate of financial investments and other government policies these donot look to spring up in the next recent years .as for example starting up a nuclear plant in a place called thungha in the north west part of india took five years .so as a result of increase in the fule price and also the rate of growth of pollution caused by the burning of these petroleum products , people are highly encourached to use other modes of travel , for example using public transport , metro system , cycling for short distances .as for example in china , employers are adoptinjg techniquies to reduce the usage of cars , like locating close to work place , using metro system for travel .also when we focus on the government policies being laid in recent times , we see that more encourangement is give for public transport than for purchase for cars .as taking for example a place called bangalore located in india , during the past five years then price for fuel has grown by more than hundred percentage , while to compensate for this issue , the government had activated more public transport , allocating industrial area next to be in one major location , where the fequency of public transport is concentrated .this did lead to the decrease in the usage of cars in bangalore .also we may raise the point of using sloar power and other modes of generating fuel for cars , like liquid fuels where water is a byproduct ( presently used to power up space flights and super sonic jets ) , also using electric cars which also need petroleum product to generate , but this demands for great amounts of revenue and also a mojor world collobration .also the research in these fileds donot show big progress form the past years for major car production .so looking at these feature , this will take time and we can not expect them to happen with in the next twenty years .parallely thier would also be the depletion of fuel in the world leading to minorty class of people to use cars ( those who could afford the high price of petroleum products ) .hence as stated and explained with examples , according to me i agree that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are as of today .
