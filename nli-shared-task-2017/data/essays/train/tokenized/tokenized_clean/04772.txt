is it more importent for students to understand ideas and concepts than its for them to learn facts ?this question offenly asked by parents that have dificultis with the academic level of thier children .in my opinion its better for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .an idea or a concept may sometimes be the result that becomes a fact .so if we understanded the idea we could conclude the fact but if we memroize a fact we can not conclude its idea since we dont no have the main base which is the idea .if we take for example ineshtine , when he discovered the nuclears a wide path of both good and bad inventions were discovered .the teacher in the school explains for students ideas and concepts then let them memorize facts becouse sometimes a whole lesson can talk about one idea that results many facts .if you want to understand and memorize the lesson s facts you must know the main idea that the lesson is talkin about .solving a math problem is the best example for this idea .supose u need to prove the fact that this equation is defined or not , you will began solving using the conepts and evntually end up with fact that it defined or not .although a fact seams to most of us easier to memorize than understanding a concept or an idea .but if we only memrized a fact it will have no meaning or no logical explanation for it in our mind , so as a result , we forget it quickly .but if we knew the idea or the concept tne memorization will take no time and the fact will live in our memory for ever .finally , knowing and idea and a concept is much better than memorizing a fact and if the fact was described as a location , i guess that the idea will be the bridge that will lead you to that location .
