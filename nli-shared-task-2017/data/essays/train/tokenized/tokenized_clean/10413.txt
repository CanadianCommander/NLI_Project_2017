communities builds future of the nation by nurturing youth of today .i believe no human being would disagree with the above statement .whatever we are or whatever becomes of a person depends largely on the community that he belongs too .today s youth is aware of the above fact and people always tend to make the reason of your survival better .thus , i do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .young people of today are more responsible .they understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .they are aware that communities are essential because man is a social animal and he needs support from his peers to survive .they are more enthusiastic and work towards it .the young people have much more caliber to plan and perform well as compared to elderly people in much less amount of time .i work in a corporation where the maximum population is in their twenties .we have so many groups that are functioning to helping the community .these used to be an individual effort which turned into an organisation after recieving overwhelming response from the youngsters .now they consist not only people from our corporation but also from whole of the state .the one i am with , works for the special care of mentally or physically challenged children named as disha .yes it consist of middle age people too but we are never short of young volunteers who like to help .the ngo s or non profit organisations are not the only way they are helping community .politics is a field where no youngster wants to end up ; specifically in a country like india .but we have young mp s ( member of parliament ) like milind deora and sachin pilot who at an tender age of 23-24 are helping people and trying to give a better future to our communites .young people are now diverted towards teaching too may it be part time .imparting education to the generations of tommorow is indeed a spendid way of helping the society .young people do whatever work they have to their full capacity which results in betterment of society .even investing in share market helps in betterment of the society because the money flows in the market resulting in more funds for government maybe for schools or even hospitals .yes i do agree today s generation is more busy with their own life .they do not find time for their families sometimes but i would rather say exceptions are always there .but that does not mean that the young people are indifferent towards the community .people in our organisation work on saturdays and sundays , sometimes during some function we even work late nights because we believe children who are yet to come need a better community as we got in our childhood .summing up i would state today s youth is aware of its responsibilities towards the community .they understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .even if they do not have enough time some people would plan out and work actively in organizations for the betterment of the people .and we would soon realize that today s youth faces more responsibility than just being a fast forward generation .
