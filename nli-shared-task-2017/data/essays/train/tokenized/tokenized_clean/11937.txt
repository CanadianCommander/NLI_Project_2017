yes i do agree with the statment `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .because just learning the facts doesnt give a student good knowledge , and i think it is not a proper way to shine his knowledge .first the student should exposed to the ideas and related concepts before learning it practically .for epitome if an engineer without learning the concepts and ideas if he started started learning the maintenance of a car and its parts , he might not be sucessful all the times because he should know the concepts and the theory of the parts before learning practically .as in this case both the theory and practical concepts and ideas are necessary .suppose if a man has some problem with his car , if he goes to a local worker to get it repaired , the worker can not find a definite solution instead he repairs it temporarily and satisfies his customer and gains money from him , here the looser is the customer .so intead of going to a local worker he could go to a company service center where the technical persons are available all the time who are skilled enough and rather they would find the actual problem and give a permanent solution to get it repaired and give the necessary precautions to take maintain the car .so here both the theory part and the practical part play a vital role .same with the case of other electronic goods like desktop pcs , laptops , televisions etc . ..most of the interviews conducted by top mncs would conduct the rounds which would test both the theoretical part and practical part so it is important for every one to understand the ideas and concepts before they learn them .hence from the above mentioned epitomes , it is not fallacious to say that it is important for everyone to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
