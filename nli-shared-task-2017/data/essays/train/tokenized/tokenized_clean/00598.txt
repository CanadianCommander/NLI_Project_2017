iam of the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i would like to cite my response on the students who have to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn .i would like to explain several examples and reasons to the issue .the students must understand the concepts and ideas .for example , if we have a mathematical subject in our graduation course , it is very difficult to solve the problems if we are unable to understand the ideas and concepts .so we would like to work hard on understanding the ideas and concepts even though we are unable to understand .for better reasons we can consider the more examples in accordance with the issue .in our daily life the ideas and concepts are more preferable when compared to learn facts .the more reasons in support to the issue are , we will digest the concepts which are happening in our regular life once we ca nt digest those concepts we have to face more difficulties .if we are doing a business then first of all we will learn the ideas and also how to form ideas in development of that business .these concepts and ideas will take a major role in several applications .if we learned the concepts more effectively , we would done a great job in our applications such as in studies , business and in our department .in some cases the learning of facts would be a achievable thing in our goals .here some examples which support the learning facts , if we are able to learn the facts effectively then we can achieve some better results in the life .
