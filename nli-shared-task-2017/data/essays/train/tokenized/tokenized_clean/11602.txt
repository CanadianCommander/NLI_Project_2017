in my opinion , it is more important for students to undersantd ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .there are several reasons why i agree with this statement .first , i think that understanding an idea and a concepts is the first step to learn something new .for example , if you do not know the concept of `` evaporation  how are you going to know the `` process of raining  or maybe understand some chemical procress that involve the concept `` evaporation  .secondly , i agree that student must know every concepts of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challegens without knowing the fact .for example , if a student know the concept of `` bowling something  , them it is would be easier for he to cook something by just following the instruction .finally , i support this thanks to a personal experience i had lived .last year , whem i was in high school , i had to take a science test and i studied hard for it .whem i started to asked it i stoped at the most important question and did not know how to answer it because of my lack of knowlegde in some sciencetific concepts .to sum up , i believe that students must focus on learning all the concepts the can and then worry on learning facts because everything goes steps by steps and the first step here to learn a new fact , is first getting the ideas and the concepts of every new words .therefore , they would have the skills to learn more than students think they could do without knowning the concept .
