cars are the most common means of transportation now-a-days especially in cities where reaching the destination in time is of utmost priority .the number of cars used is always increasing with the increase in population .but , i strongly believe that after twenty years , the number of cars used will be much less than those being used now .as the number of cars used keeps increasing , the amount of air pollution caused by them will also be on the rise .this will cause global warming as a result of which , there would be many coastal areas that will be submerged in the years to come .i feel that this will cause an awareness among the people and will encourage them to use public mode of transportation in order to reduce the number of vehicles causing pollution .another reason that i feel would result in a decrease in the number of cars used is that the increased traffic would cause big delays in reaching the destinations .the only feasible solution that i see for the traffic problem is the reduction in the number of vehicles .widening of roads might help to some extent in solving the traffic problem , but beyond a limit it is not of much use .i feel that as a result of this , people will be forced to voluntarily give up the use of cars inorder to meet their requirements on time .apart from all these reasons , i also feel that there is a lot of risk associated with car journeys .as an effect of this , more and more people might opt for relatively safer means of transportation like the train .furthermore , in most of the cases the train can be relied upon to take us to the destination on time .this is one of the primary reason for the increased use of local trains in cities where people are in a hurry to reach their offices , schools etc . .finally , i wish to conclude stating that the above mentioned reasons are clear indicators that there could be fewer cars used in twenty years when compared to those being used now .
