over the years , people have developed two very important theories about a student s development .some will say that it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts and others will say that it is more important for them to learn facts .personally , i believe that both theories are important , but the understanding of ideas and concepts is the real key to a student s success .i say this because if a student just learns facts , that is all that they are learning , simple facts .on the other hand , if a student learns to understand concepts and ideas , he or she is getting the tools to face all types of situations in school , university , job , and life itself .a clear example of what i mention above are two friends that i grew up with , but graduated from different schools .one of them graduated from a school where their principal objective was to teach the student how to think , analyze and understand concepts and ideas besides just teaching them facts and the other one came from a school where the main teaching technique was to make students memorize all types of information .when the time to go to the university came , both students graduated from school with excellent grades but the difference among them started to show on the way .the one that was used to learning and memorizing facts started to experience serious difficulties if things did nt work out exactly as they were supposed to , while the one trained to understand concepts and ideas found out how to work his way through the changes and experienced much better results .over the years , the student who was just taught facts saw the results that the other one was obataining and finally comprehended that he needed to change .once he did , things started working out much better for him .i am sure that the example i mention above happens all the time all over the world .personally , i was lucky enough to be taught to understand concepts and ideas rather than just plain facts and i can assure that it has helped me a lot throughout my life because it has given me the tools to comprehend , understand and analyze things from different points of view , from different perspectives and to look for solutions when apparently ther are nt any , which you wo nt be able to do if you just learn facts .
