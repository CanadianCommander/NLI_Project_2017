some people believed that older people enjopy life less than young people , because the young people are active , erengetic and maybe have more time .but in my opinion , it is not ture , there are at least three reasons for my believe .first of all , most older people have their clear goals for their lives , after more experience , they know more the more meaning of lives , and know themselves more .then they could easily choose their type of ilves based on the real surroundings .it is exciting and meaningful thing to churse up the goals they have .so they will feel enjjoyful during the time to get goals .another important reason of my believe is that the older people have more chance to do the things they want , because they have ability to arrange their time and have enough money to help the ti  hing they want come true .for instance , many people like travling , no matter young people or older ones , but the young people it is much more difficult to have a comfort trip than older people .obveriously , the young must face to much problems ,the last but no least reason for me is the older people experience more will understand more fact of the problem in everyday lives , they can easilly face to the bad things which can not change , avoid bad things before it happened , solve the problem which had been happened .on the other hand , older people cherish the beautiful moment more than the young people , because they understand it is difficult to have the changce .so in front of the real life , even bad things happened , older people will have more enjoythings to do
