i would have to say that i agree with the statement : `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  and here is why :when you are young ( i would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have less commitments and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit .please allow me to explain my ideas with some examples .when i mean you have more energy to go aroung , i am talking about vitality and being in shape , it would not be as easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenties , when your body is tone and strong .than when your are in your fifties even if you stay in shape , there is always the risk of a heart attack or other conditions that normally appear with age .and things that seemed okey before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now .as for the commitments and responsabilites , i gravitate towards family and work .to me these two are the center of my life .i could not do the things i did in my twenties now that i have a family to support and i am tied with a mortgage and credit card bills .so i guess i would call this the `` settled life factor  , which could be pretty tight in both spheres but more manageable when young .finally , i belive that when you are young , you are more willing to take risks , go for adventures and take chances as you go .as people mature they some how change their ways , and settle for something secure which i would translate into a calm life , with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be `` used  during vacation times , maybe once a year .and as i have heard people say : if i did nt do that when i was young i do nt think i could do it now .
