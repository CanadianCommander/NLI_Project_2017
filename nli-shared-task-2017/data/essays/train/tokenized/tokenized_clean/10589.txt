every year we get older and older and we do nt care of the changes which happen .we often do nt notice the alteration brought by the passing of time .but in reality we should wonder if our life is not better when we are young .do nt people usually think that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?in this essay , we are first going to show the aspects of enjoying life as an elderly person and then we are going to talk about life when we are young .first we are considering the fact if elderly people reallz enjoy their lifes .on the one hand , elderly people are often lonely and have few friends .they live together in special houses where no young people are .people in such homes often lose their pleasure in life , because they are disconnected from the outstanding world .on the other hand elderly people are less attractive than younger people .they have also more health trouble and are often disprised by a lot of people .additionally , these people always live together and see no other people .this is why they also become more and more sad , because they notice that their are rejected by society and that nobody cares about them .on the whole i would say that it is very difficult for elderly people to enjoy life , because they often are very lonely and have few friends who look after them .now we are going to see that young people can enjoy their live .first we can say that young people meet a lot of other people .they are always with friends , doing sport , playing games or enjoying their life .a lot of the time is spent in places where a lot people are and this gives those people the opportunity to meet new people .secondly , young people are more attractive than elderly people are and they have no difficulty to find a boy-friend or a girl-friend .they are usually good looking which causes that they can better enjoy their live .thirdly they are well-off , are in a good shape and health and they can do what they want .their strength allows them to travel all over the world and see new places .furthermore there are not many limits which prevent them from beeing happy , because these young people have the whole life in front of them .these people often do nt have to worry , because their live will last for a long time .to conclude we see that , as time goes by , we change and that these changes affect our perception of life .when we are young we meet a lot of people , we are more attractive and we are well-off , which are all things which disappear with the fact of becoming older .this is why i agree with the statement and find that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
