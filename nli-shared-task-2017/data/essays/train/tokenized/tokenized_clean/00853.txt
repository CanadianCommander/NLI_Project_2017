nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generations .however , i disagree with the statement .in my opinion , the young people , at least in singapore where i am currently studying , do contribute to their communities with great passion and enthusiasm .first of all , the youth s passion to serve the communities can be evident in the large number of voluntary activities they are involved in .almost every secondary or high school student participates in community service on a regular basis .they either go to the community library to do clean-ups and shelving , or they go to the `` old folks home  to interact with the old people there and ensure these people have fun and joy .the musical groups in some schools may also organise concerts for the public , and donate the profit made to charity organisations .the regular involvement of the youth in voluntary community service undoubtedly demonstates their enthusiasm and effort in helping their coummunity .more importantly , the government also places a great emphasise in ensuring the young people to give sufficient time to helping their communities .the ministry of education introduces the `` community involvement programme  ( short-termed cip ) , where students must contribute to their communities in some form , and the time of their contribution is reported by the related organisations .this time , known as `` cip hours  , is an important element in the assessment of a student .if one does not fulfill the minimun requirement of cip hours , he may not be admitted by a good high school or college .this education policy ensures that the young people contribute enough time to helping their communities .furthermore , the effort of school and society is also crucial in making sure that the youth contribute enough to the communities .in school , desirable social values such as care for those in needs are taught to students so that they can become better citizens .teacher encourage and guide students to carry out service learning projects , in which they either serve a particular group of people as mentioned earlier , or they can raise funds for charity organisations .some companies facilitate these service learning projects by providing initial fundings and organising competitions .for instance , one company , `` ie singapore  , organises a competiton in which they provide 1000 dollars initial fund to each participating group .these groups are supposed to use the fund and come out with a creative way to raise more money for charity organisations .the group raising the greatest sum wins .personally i participated in this competition last year .we used the funding to buy raw materials and made them into different shapes of balloons .it selt well and after 4 months of hard work , we were able to raise over 90000 dollars fund .we donated the money to children s cancer foundation .in conclusion , nowadays young people are having great academic burdens and more demanding requirements , but their effort to helping the communities is not sacrificed .they devote enough time in coummunity service in voluntary activities , under the education policy of the government , and as inspired by school and society .
