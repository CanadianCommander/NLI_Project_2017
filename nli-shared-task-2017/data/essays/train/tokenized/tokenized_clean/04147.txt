media and advertisement have one goal : to promote and sell their product .this directly implies that they need to make their product attractive , which is sometimes not the truth .to make their product or service attractive , they need to make the consumer , the client , the fixed public , feel like they need it or want it .yes i believe that most advertisements need to make products seem better than what they truly are .special skills are needed in different areas to make a product more attractive .you need a publicist , who will advertise the product where it would find the most adequate public for the product .the people that are more probable to buy it .you also need a promoter , who is not much different than the publicist , or an advertiser , whose sole purpouse is to sell it .whether he needs to luy or transofrm the truth about the object , not doing so would make him unworthy of his job .you also need a technician , a designer , a whole team that can create the right material for the publcist to be able to promote the good .this can be teh photographer that take sthe pictrue of the object as well as the person behind the computer that edits the photo so it can appear even appealing to the eye .yes there are also many aspects of teh object to improve for it to be able to sell .such as making it appealing to the widest public possible .you also need to make it attractive to eye , so that when the client sees it he can imagine himself using it or simple having it .the photo or video has to make the object look beautiful .my point is that there are whole study fields , technical teams , and careers that specialize in making thing seem much better than they are .if there are classes that teach how to do so this statement must be true .and if careers are offered in such fields than it s becaus etehy need professionals .
