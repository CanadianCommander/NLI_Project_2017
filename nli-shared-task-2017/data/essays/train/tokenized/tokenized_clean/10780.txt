at the same time that companies are producing more products , it has been necessary in order to be competitive in the consumer world to create effective ways to advertise them .in that pressure generated by companies , they are producing products that seem to be much better in the advertisements than they really are .although not all products can be categorized with the statement , i agree with it .one reason to explains this , it is to see how food companies advertise its products .to be more specific , we could use mcdonalds advertising campaigns .on these , the way that a burger is presented is much better comparing with the same burger that you buy at any restaurant .the size , the colors , the ingredients are not compared with the one that you see on the tv ad .on the other hand , because this effective advertisements are reproduced in more revenues , companies keep using them in order to mantain growth .and that continue behavior is generating confusion among the consumers that rely usually on these ads to buy some products .another reason why companies are using this strategy is that tipically they have competitors .all of them want to improve their sales by producing this type ads that definetily convince people to buy products .therefore , the market departments on this companies start to develop this type of ads that are necessary in order to mantain a good position in the market .although companies usually rely on this type of method , others think that this is unethical and never try to reproduce or show better quality in their products .furthermore , some products may not applied in this type of ads so for them it is not possible to use that strategy .for example insurance advertising .they just can show what advantages they have .these are according with the reality .finally , in order to protect consumers rights , several institutions have been created .they rule and measure ways that products can be shown , and also they must be conform with the reality .however , these institutions have not been enough to control this type of business behavior and this still occur in the us market .
