there are two different things which are idea and fact .those are seems like so simular , however , it is so different .some people think fact is truth , however in my opinion , it is not true .what is fact ?it is the thing that we believe it is true .for example , before galileo believed earth is one , no one believed his opinion .facts are usually confined in one paradiam when people are belong in there .campare with fact , idea or concept suggest people to think about different way .for example , the fact which was believed that the earth is flat , it made people stuck on the thought .however , the idea which was believed the earth is one , made galileo to think about that and research about earth .idea makes people to have more creative ways and method about thought or solution .idea is motivation .when we were young , we underwent that we watched animation on tv .usaully the subject was about treaveling in the universe .now we read articles in newpaper that nasa succesed to reach the moon or the other planet .these kind of ideas motivated people to estimate and reseach about something that we do not know yet .we can also feel that idea and concept are more important than fact in the classroom .before 19c , especially during the war , school more taught about fact and physical things than idea or creative things .however , nowadays , schools are changed to teach and encourage about idea and creative method , so they make student to learn about more creative thought .we still live in industry revolution paradiam .we still leave to descover about earth , universe , or more about technology .nowadays  society is getting to change so fast , so i believe it is better to teach student more about idea which can change to our next paradaim , than fact which might not be truth no more .
