it is often said that young people would not spend enough time to helping and supporting their communities in our society .i disagree with that opinion .at first , i do not think that interest in policy has decreased over the years .the most important reason for that is that our system is democratic which means that people have the ability to vote and can influence policy which is not possible in a dictatorship , for example .another important factor is that every citizen has this right from a certain age on .in the past , that often depended on the income and women did not have suffrage at all .today , nearly every political party has a youth organization , as well .that would not be neccessary , if young people were not interested in policy .furthermore there are a lot of poltical independent organizations which concern about the interests of the communities .in the past there were neither political youth organizations , nor independent poltical youth organzitaions in spite of the decreasing number of people to vote , i think it would be exaggerated to say that young people do not put enough effort or time in helping their communities .
