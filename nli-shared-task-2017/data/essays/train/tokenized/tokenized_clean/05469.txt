young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , now ; i m not sure here at japan , but i know that im my country australia ; we give up our time to help the poor in need .most schools do nt have a rule that they have to a least several hours of community service , and everyone except for the slackers strive to recieve the honouring badge of community sevice .especially year sevens must try to gain this to show the little kids younger than us that if they want to get a badge they should do community service .the reason for the year sevens to try to gain the badge is because the years pre-school - year 6 look up to the year sevens as the head of the junoir schiool .so from the statement question , no young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , except those schools who have a rule of community service , because most young people care only about them selves and not the others .the young people of today do nt understand that they could make a big difference just by helping their community , for example they could organise a fund raiser , but it does nt have to be big , they could just donate some money to the country that is in poverty , or help thier mum or dad in the kitchen .it s that simple to making a differnce .so my final answer is no , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , but they could try .
