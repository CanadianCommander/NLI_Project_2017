while some of people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , others aim at specializing in one specific subject .what i address here is both of them are equally important to one person .not only broad knowledge we need , but aslo specifical knowledge in one specific field we must own .by broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can view the world in a total whole one .without broad knowledge of different subjects , we can not comprehense the world correctly even .there is a story available to sustain my assertment : long long ago , some blind men were talking about the real feature of a elephant .some of them had touched the legs of the elephant , so they said elephant was just like a great wall ; some of them had touched the ears of the elephant , so they asserted that the elephant was just like a big plate ; others of them had touched the tails of the elephant , so they conjured that the elephant was just like swings .we may laugh at the conclusions made by the blind men , but we must admit that it is lacking of global views of the elephant that makes them so ridiculous .so in my opinion , the most meaningful th of owning broad knowledge of many academic is to offer us a global view of the world , so we can march into the uncharted world without low propability to make such mistakes just like ones blind men made .by specialized in one specific subject , we can explore the world deeper .without this insight , we can get nothing about the essense of the natural !this is more important in recent years .with the development of computers and internet , the quantity of knowledge has explored in an incredible speed .it is impossible for anyone to master all the knowledge of many academic subjects .the society has shaped into a world of cooperations , for example , a car manufactory may design their engine in the us , make the tire in indonesia , produce varieties of materials in china , and make all the matrials together into a complete car in taiwan .this trend has forces people to be an expert in a specific field .from this point of view , it is very important for the contemporaries to specialize in one specific subject .in conclusion , we must own a broad knowledge of many academic subjects to avoid some obvious stupid mistakes which are not consistent with the basic principles of many academic subjects .at the same time , we also pursue to be a expert in one specific subject to cooperate with others and contribute to the development of society .
