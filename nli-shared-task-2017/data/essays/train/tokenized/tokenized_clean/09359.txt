i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .companies want make money form those products so they try to show better than they really are .companies use techonology to create a good advertisements for their products .they use colors , images , ext .which attract people to buy those products .advertisement is a important isue to sell products .good advertisements have advantages for products which is advertise .in the advertisements , they try to show products much better than they really are .they use visiual things or they use sounds to make the advertisement more colorful .most of the time , those things attract people to buy those products which has a increadible advertisement .for example , my father bought a sprey for his car .in this sprey s advertisement , they show a red bmw car which has some spots on it is cleaned with this sprey perfectly and also in the advertisement they show some references for that sprey .my father s car has some same spot too and my father belive that advertisement and these references and he decided to buy that products shown in that advertisement .this sprey did not work on my father s car .it caused to change colors where he used it on the car .when he searchen why it did not work he figured out that sprey not used for all spot occured on the car , but in the advertisement , they do not warn you that what kind of spot is ok for this sprey .advertisements use to introduce the product to the public .they try to show the product much better than they are .because of that kind of advertisements people get wrong idea about products most of the time .by advertisements , companies want make more money so they can use all techonogical ways to attract people to buy their products , but this kind of advertisement do not make their product better but they make money for sure .
