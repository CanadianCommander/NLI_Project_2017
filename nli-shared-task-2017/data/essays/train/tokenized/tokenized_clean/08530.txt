the question of wether young people enjoy life more than old people seems to be too general to give a precise answer .since at any age there are groups of people that enjoy life more than other groups , the question could be easily subdevided into questions about other categories such as the wealth , the health , and family situation of the individuals .in order to nevertheless give an answer to this question , one has to be aware of the obvious difficulties arising from the fact that the answer might not apply to every individual .like a young person can have a difficult childhood , an old person can live without the usually associated pain from chronical deseases .in my opinion the difference which leads to a joyful life or not lies in the personality , and attitude of the individual .to support this idea , it is important to consider the resources available to older people after a long income periode and furthermore the modern medication and health treatments which ease to life with even chronical deseases .it is clear from the biological point of view a young person has less to worry about health issues .however with the modern medication it is possible even for the very old to maintain an active life of cultural experiences , family meetings , and time for personal projects .in addition , old people after a successful career have in general more money available , and can spend it without the need to go to work during business days .this allows them to travel , see new places , and meet people .all in respect to the individual preferences which might exist .it is thus easier for them to enjoy these specific plaisanties .for it is a question of definition what an enjoyed life represents the actual reponse to the question is a matter of what a person s individual feeling is .an old man with a young attitude might enjoy life in a similar matter as a young person .however , he has more resources , more time , and possibly more enthusiasm to profit from the time that remains for him .in conclusion , i can not accept the simple statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .it depends rather subtile on every individual s attitude , and personal background , such as belongings , health and family , acquired throughout life .
