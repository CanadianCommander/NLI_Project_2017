helping our community .i think it s true that young people nowadays are nt willing to help their relatives and friends as much as they did decades ago .but i also think that this is a phenomenon appearing strongest in the ` developed western civilisation  .for us times change rapidly , everything grows faster , moves faster , people travel a lot and the world itself becomes ` smaller  .i mean you have the chance to study in europe , work in china and buy a holiday cottage in mexico so i think our way of living tends to go into a more ` selfish  way .family and community is a strong background that everyone needs but i think it s not the first thing you think about in our times if you start living on your own .you live on your own so you care about yourself first that s our way of living i think .years or decades ago people settled down and founded a family , helped their parents keeping the business and traditions alive and so the connection to the people surrounding them was more evident .but as mentioned , in my opinion , i think this is more a cultural thing , people , especially younger people in a third world country for example still have that close connection to their relatives and communites as it s necessary .they are more or less their parents  life insurance that you pay here from your own money , so i think that s one more reason that people nowadays are more focused on themselves .all in all even me as one of those young persons nowadays still feel that there s enough time to help my community .maybe it s based on different reasons than years ago but i try to help my people whenever it is necessary in all aspects of life and i also like to receive support from my community myself .
