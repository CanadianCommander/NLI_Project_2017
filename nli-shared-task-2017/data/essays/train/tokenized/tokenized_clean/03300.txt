to specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .firstly i would like to quote a saying `` half knowledge is dangerous  .this explains that having a broad or not perfect knowledge is dangerous than having no knowledge .we should have broad knowledge of academic subjects only upto a certain stage of education and then a specialized subject .secondly consider a person who is planning for his future .he wants to join in any one of the higher studies through one of these-iit , aieee , eamcet , bits .having an specialized idea of one will make him get succeeded getting admission in to higher studies .stepping him into all ways make lead him not being succeeded in any one atleast .next let me state an example .consider a person who wants to have a broad knowledge of civil engineering .he gos through roughly having an idea how houses are constructed , how soil below accounts to the structure , what are requiremenys of house ( like electrical works , sewage distribution , pipeline connection etc . . ) .he needs the assistance of each and every person specialized in each of these feilds to take an appropriate defination which which suits all the factors .rather if he is specialized in one of these he could completely take chance over that .so , i believe having specialized knowledge of one subject and being perfect in that is advantageous .one can completely relie on themselves and even defend others while they are misleaded .having a broad idea one should always consult others for more details regarding that topic .the idea of being specialized also helps a person to improve his self confidence because he can perfectly deal effectively .the state of feeling that `` i can do this  incorporates a lot self confidence in a person .the knowledge of specialized subject will also make a person mentally strong .at last i conclude by saying that it is better to specialize in one subject rather having broad knowledge of all the academic subjects .
