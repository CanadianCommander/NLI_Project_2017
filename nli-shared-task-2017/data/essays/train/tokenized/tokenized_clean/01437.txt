learning and understanding are a large part of our culture .i totally agree with this statement because as far as i am concerned , i think that before to act , it is necessary to understand .however , there are several advantages for students to understand ideas and concepts and advantages for them to learn facts .first of all , some students prefer understand ideas and concepts because for us if they understand the meaning of a word , they will be able to use it again .to support of that view , i would like to give an example of my experience .i am currenty in a language school to learn english .it is very important to understand the meaning of each word in order to use it .fortunately , professors explain all meanings of a word because in english , a word can have several meanings .second , for others students , learning facts is more important than understand ideas and concepts .indeed , for us , if they learn facts , they will be able to use it again in their real life .for instance , i was in a law university and one of my major was real estate > in this class , we only learnt facts such as for example what are formalities to build a house or to obtain a loan .for me this class was the mot interesting and above all the less boring that to learn by heart some concepts and ideas .to summarize , i think that understanding and learning are both essential .nevertheless , the point of view of students can be different about of what is the most important for us
