i agree with the statement of successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in this society , i think that if you do not try news things , you would be just a worker but not the boss , because the boss need to have the ambition , confidence , and interest to be success .first , ambition is the main point to let the people try new things .if you have nt the ambition , you would not try with new things and just only doing what you already know how to do well , because you have no ambition to accept the fault that you make or you have no ambition to accept you are not success .ambition is a thought in your mind that gives conmfident to you and do the things .if you always escape to face to try new things , you would not get sucess any more .second , confidence also really important to let the people try new things .confidence and ambition are very similar , but ambition is internal , and confidence is external .for example , you need to attend in a competition of basketball , and you never play basketball before , you have the amnbition to try to play the basketball , but you do not have the confidence to attend in the competition because you have no confidence to win this competiton .confidence not only create by yourself , also you have confidence or not is because of your close friends or family , if they are support you , you would have confidence to try the new things .third , your interests of what you want to know also really important .for example , i need to apply in an university , and i need to choose the subject , and i am good in art , i want to be a art designer , which means drawing is my interest , if i get in the university , i need to learn the new things and skilld oif art , but this is my interests , although it is diffcult to learn , but i still would face it .at last , have ambition , confidenceand interests are helping me to be the successful people try new things and take riskd rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .if i am a person that dont try any new things and just odo somethings that i am always doing good , i would think the things bored and no success feeling on the things .
