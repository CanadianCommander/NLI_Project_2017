succes means to invent new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks .it s not only restricted to succesful people rather than to all people who are failure too .as succes comes only by experincing opposite results .it will be new experience if we take risks and invent new things .this boosts our confidence and gives a new experience .i agree that succesful people try new things rather than doing what they already knew .firstly succesful people try new things because as already they tasted succes in their life this gives confidence to work more by taking risks .scientists are good examples for taking risks and trying new things .if scientists does nt try news things then we wont be able to access the inventions which they made like pencillin , steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by wright brother and so on .secondly people try new things in which they get new experience .if a person is doing a know work for a past few years this not only makes him boring but also losses his interest in that work .while experimenting new things we can get more knowledge in the subject which gives us soul satisfaction .today we recognise scientists by their works , but we do nt recognise a daily worker in a factory .experiments are done by taking risks like astromer who take high risks while travelling other planets or solar system , in between they may loose their life s by having collision with other planets or by some technical problems .best example for this is the well know astrnomer kalpana chawla , who did a various experiments by taking risks .her experiments to land in space gave huge information of which a common people is not familiar with .an intellectual person is well recognised by his works .a person is seen by his achievements which he had contributed to society hence , i totally agree that succesful people try new try things and take risks to invent new things for social well being .
