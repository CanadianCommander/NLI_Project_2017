in my environment i can find a lot of examples of young poeple helping their communities .examples like scout organizations or similar ones show clearly that youg people nowaday give enough time to helping other people .that is why i do not agree with the statement .first and foremost , think of all this organisations like scouts or christian yough movements .in each country you can find this kind of organisations .they all have the same goals .they want to make young people more involved in the community and more over , teach them how to become a responsible adult .in my country this kind of groups are very popular and they have a lot of activ members .i also used to be a member of such an organisation .that is why i can say that they do a lot for their communities .for example , they help parents to guard their children if they do nt have enough time , they collect money for caritative organistations .all members of such a group give surely a lot of time to help their community .by the same token , i would like to say that you can also find young poeple involved in individual actions .let s take for an example young people who go shoping for older poeple .they also help immediatly their surrounding .other go to help older citisens in cleaning their house , or doing their garden work .all this are nice examples of young person giving time to help their communities .of course you will always find some young , respectless , and egoistic young poeple who just want to make profit and to enjoy life .but this is nothing new .this kind of poeple have always exicted and of course exist also nowadays .but they are not the majority .not where i live .to sum up briefly , i really do nt think young poeple do nt care about their communities and do nt give enough time to helping them .i really think it is like it always used to be , some poeple care and other do nt , but the majority is involved in social life and give enough time to helping their communities .
