in the era of science and technology , the people generally pay more attention to short path for learning rather than long path such as deep understanding of ideas and concepts .everyone has different perspective of education .so , when i am thinking by considering all the points , i conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .i hold several reasons derived from my personal experience for holding this opinion .first , more emphases should be placed on the way in which the ideas are derived .this is possible only if person understands ideas and concept .for instance , if i dont know newtons law of motion , i am not able to establish a stucture of steamer .and evenif i have structeured it would be captivated soon , because of misdesign .so , just learning facts how to manufacture the steamer does nt ensure me the effective working of it .moreover , for innovations understanding of ideas and concepts is necessary .most of the investigations concur with the fact that understanding of concept lead to development of facts .for example , understanding of the mechanism of action of a drug on receptor , derives the fact wheather the drug will have side effects or not .it is impossible for any psychologist to deny the fact that learning fact is short term memory , while understaning the same thing is long term memory .so , understanding will not limit your knowledge till writing a test , but throughout your life time .eventually , this knowledge can be utilised in constuctive and innovative way .for example , when i was little , my teacher told me to understand ideas of cell biology .on that platform , ultimately i developed a model showing different physicochemical reactions occuring in the cell .in summary , i found that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept , because some of the many advantages of understanding ideas and concepts include long term memory , basic manufacturing sence and innovative ideas which creat a fact .
