`` you ll never regret the risks you have taken  ...this is one of my way of thinking and living .i completely agree with the statement .you have to try new things and even take some risks if you want to be successful .during our life , everybody has to make some choices which will completely influence their future .the human being is never complete .we always have to learn new things to go on .our mind is like a computer which need more and more informations to work .the life is a succession of choices which increase our knowledge .we also have to share our knowledge with other people who want to grow up .if we want to perform in a particular field , we have to be ready to learn always more and more until we ll feel really confident about it .every popular icon has had to take some risks to become somebody famous and regognized by the others .but this way of thinking does nt only apply for the richest or world famous people of our planet .it s also avalaibable for the average citizen who wants to succeed or to do something from his life .during our carrier , we are often confronted to make some choices which can influence the future .we do nt have to be affraid of change .when we choose to do something we can only grow up and we will not go back to our initial statement .we do nt have to consider the fear but the proudness of our choice .if the risk to take seems to high , we can share the idea with some members of our family or co-workers .there will always be an experimented person who will give us the good advice to go on .like the animals , the human being has to follow his instinct .
