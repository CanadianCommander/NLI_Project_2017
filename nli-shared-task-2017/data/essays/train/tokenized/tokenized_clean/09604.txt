we are living in a society surrounded by various adivertisements which not only appear on tv shows , newspapers and internet , but also on other occasions , such as subways , bus stops , or even on the bulloons flying in the sky .some people think all these ads make them easier to get access to the products they are not so familiar , while others consider it a obligatory input of business management .in my opinion , both of the comments are reasonable .as we all know , with the development of modern technologies , our life style is more and more following a faster pace .so when we are considering purchase of our necessities , it is a little time-consuming to pick up the products from the others .ads help us to go through the choosing process .many ads maybe exaggerate their effects , for example , the advertising pictures showed on the internet do have some difference from the original products , but since all of them are exaggerating in some level , considering that , they would be equal as well , which is understandable because every company has to beautify their products to make profits .however , sometimes some ads boosts their products so much that it would be actually undermine the effects , for they will be too good to believe .but this kinds of ads should be prevented in case some people would be cheated on that .what is more , it is very discouraging and disappointing to discover that the products you have bought is not as good as the ads said .i can take our wireless internet access for example .we installed the high speed internet last year , and we are expecting to enjoy the high-speed online surfing service , but it turned out to much slower that what it said on the promotion handbook .so after that , i am becoming more and more convinced on the statememt in the topic .to sum up , according to my experience , many ads will certainly more or less exaggerate their properties , i d better choose from them carefully .
