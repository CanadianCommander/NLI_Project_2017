do younger people enjoy life more than older people ?this has been much debated and in my opinion , the older people enjoy life much more than younger people .there are several reasons to support my reasoning .firstly , older people have lived most of their years and have been through a lot of stress filled and busy life .now its time for them to sit back and relax and pick up other activites for which they probably didnt have time during their younger years .whereas , the younger generation is more concerned with accumulating more wealth and improve his career .secondly , the youth is busy planning his future and supporting his family .he has several worries and the current lifestyles do not allow him to enjoy life to the fullest .he needs to be completely focussed at his career and compete against each other .meanwhile , older people generally have achieved most their goals from a career point of view , tend to look at life in a more relaxed manner .also , the older man is wiser and knows the importance of enjoying life better that a younger person .for instance , older people tend to spend their precious time travelling across the globe or spending time with family as compared to younger people who are bound to their work for most part of the year .while a few might argue that the youthful exuberance would edge out over older people , in my opinion older people enjoy their life more having achieved most of their goals on the professional front and are in a better position to take up new hobbies and new activites .
