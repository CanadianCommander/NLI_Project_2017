regarding the statement i consider myself absoluley in favour , since under my perspective , advertisements are intended only to persuade the reader or listener to buy the product .they dont really care if you like or not the advertisement , they just focus on the economic effect of it .as a result they are willing to give a wrong idea of a product in order to ensure their economic profit of it .as a matter of example , we daily see comercials of food , where for instance food is prepared in a certain manner that it simply looks irresitible to your eyes .they tend tu use severall implements that provide a changed version of what the food really was .recalling the example of a burguer we can appeciate the way in which they will show the burguer as a tentative meal .some aspects such as its texutre and physical appearance might be modified in order to ensure that you create a mental image of the burguer and your future meal might be it .also they can create or manipulate people comments regarding the burger so that for instnace you get to know what other felt when eating such meal .another type of prduct that tends to be used for advertisements are the excersice machines , that are shown to be easier to work on , and proved to have inmediate results .the main objective of this is to sell a determined apparatus that will provide what they think your body requires , for instance the ab pro is a machine to work on where you by just slightly moving train your muscles and reinforce their shape .the advertisement uses well prepared and fine physically people to use the machine in order to give you the idea that after using it , you will end as that person .the truth is that advertisements actually provide us of information concerning severall product .however due to the fact that their objective is to promote a product they are prepared to modify the products in some aspects in order to ensure the selling of it .just like the example given of the buguer and the machine where you actually see a changed product in order to persuade you on buying that particular object .obviously the modification they do on the product is intended to make it look better , so that you are willing to buy it .
