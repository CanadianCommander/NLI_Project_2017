i agree with this statement because of several reasons .my experience and observation made me think that way .there is a large number of advertisements surrounding our daily life including tv commercials , posters , billboards , and so on .however , there are not many advertisements showing what they acually are in my opinion .for example , one time i purchased a mascara at a drug store , because i was attracted by its poster portraying a beautiful lady with a long mascara .nevertheless , i was very disappointed by it s result .there was no difference between other products .as my example , i am very sure that there are many people who have experienced same .most of advertisements are usually over exaggerated because they need to sell their products .in order to sell their products , they have to attract their target audience .it is not easy thing to do .actually the cost for advertise products is oftenly more expensive than cost for making a product .it is very obvious that company want to make their products look good or even better than they really are .moreover , many companies compete with other companies in the same industry .due to high industry competition , company even more encouraged to promote their products in extreme ways .it is their job .in conclusion , because of there reasons i agree with the statement that most advertisements look much better that they really are .
