without question , i disagree this statement .there are two reasons : dvelpoping countries and the evorution of cars .first , the people who need car become more larger in these twenty years than today .because in most of the developing countries , the population are becoming larger and larger , and in such coutry people want to have cars as they become rich .for example , in china there were many people who only have bike in ten years ago , but today many chinese come to rich and bigin to buy cars .thus , as developing countries grow in economically , needs for cars is increasing .second , in these days , cars become more harmless for environments because of the evorution of their tecnology .for example , soler cars only uses sunlight and dose not contaminate air .if these cars become more cheeper , people who care about environments could use cars .thus in developed countories , the needs for cars may not decline .all in all , i can not agree with that in twenty years there willbe fewer cars in use .because this opinion dose not concern about needs in developing countries and evorution of tecnology .
