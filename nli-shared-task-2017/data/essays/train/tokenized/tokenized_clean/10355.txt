education goals have changed in the past few years .people have become aware that school represents a whole world where kids are exposed to a great variety of situations .from daily tasks like reading a passage or keeping the classroom clean to how to deal with an abusive classmate or the first love .if that much is at stake then education can not be aimed to learning facts only .there are also other reasons that support the statement that education must be based on the understanding of ideas as well on the acquiring of skills .first , skills as well as the understanding of ideas last forever and they are universal .the processes involved can be used anywhere , anymoment .second , they serve as tools for dealing with a less narrow variety of situations as opposed with the memorization process that is involved in the learning of a fact .and as tools they can be used to find new and alternative ways to apply the same ideas .third , they improve your abbility of making connections which is very important nowadays when knowledge is too vast to grasp .finally , they can be custumized to every student s needs .facts imply that every one should memorize them in the same way while if the teacher is taking in account the personal abbilities of each person then a personal approach is rea i believe that when teacher and students only want to study and learn facts they will enclose the knowledge and they will narrow their opportunities to develop in a world that has become more and more ecclectic .even though the statement referes only to the students , teachers have a great deal to learn , first they should discover what motivates them to teach in a certain way and then they should evaluate whether their methods are reaching more that memory or if otherwise they are helping students to reach higher standarsds .
