nowadays , our society provides us with a new kind of difficulty : we always have to evaluate the pros and the cons of what we are going to do in order to keep our job or our husband or wife .consequently , we can observe two behaviours in the population : some of us keep on trying new things and taking risks to reach the success .others prefer doing what they already know to do well .we are going to see whether a solution is better than the other one or not .first of all , when you only keep on doing what you already know how to do well , you never discover new activities and thus , you do nt try things that you could however enjoy .to illustrate my point , i can explain my own experience : i have always played rugby during my childhood , and i reached quite a good level .nevertheless , 2 years ago , i realised that i had never tried to practice another sport and that s why i decided to become a triathlet .although at the beginning i found it hard to swim during many kilometers , i can claim now that really enjoy this new sport and that it allowed me to discover a new , more individual activity .thus , i could live a new kind of success .secondly , when you are working on a project , two solutions are available .the first one depends on your own knowledges , and ask you to avoid any kind of risk .in that way , you will perhaps be able to keep your job during a long time .but is that the only thing you can hope during your entire life ?i would rather say no .it s obvious that one day , you will want to have more responsabilities .and the way to that success is to try new things and to take risks .to put these ideas in a nutshell , i would rather say that i agree with the statement .nonetheless , perhaps that s the best solution is somewhere between these two extremes .
