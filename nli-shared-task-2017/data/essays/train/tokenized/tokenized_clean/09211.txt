the quetion of advertising is for me very important , because my childrens seems to be very influencal about it .i thing it is true that most advertisements make some products better than they are really .i will take the example of the foods industries .every days we could show on the tv or the newspapers advertisememts that proved the qualities of the foods products .they took as support wellknown peoples like football players our basketball players , in order to prouve that the products are very wealthy , so the people who are very influencable could take this message at the first level and imagine , if they have the same foods , that they will be able to improve their own performamces and fill better in their lifes .as the results we all knows that there is a big problems in our socities and especialy in the u.s.a and in europe with obesity .because of the message bring through the advertissememts a big part of the population are changing the traditionals ways of using food and buy every days industrials foods the a saturations of fat .but that is the most remarquable in this situation and the dangers of the advertisememts , it is that the same compagnies that developped the products will a lot of fat are actually developping a new range a products in order to reduce the numbers of calories in the alimentations .again the advertising is use to promote the new products , and in this cases they wil use the same supports like sportifs to bring an over message .the problem we are focusing is that advertisements have only a positive message and they forget to show the negative points of the product , so a majorities of consumers event they known this bad side they are more influence by the positive side a the message bring by the advertisements .in conclusion we must all be able to understand that the job of advertsememt is to show only the bettre side of the product .
