there is a saying in my language that goes like : ` if only the young could know and the old could do  .this explains an important lesson , but one has to attain a certain degree of wisdom to understand it .in my opinion being young is more enjoyable , being older may make somebody more experienced but it would not make his life less boring .while you re young your mind is fresh , open for ideas and future is full of possibilties .excitement is more preferable than the regret which inevitably comes with the old age and even feeling of fullfillment ca nt beat the hapiness you feel when you re upon a new discovery .just remember your greatest triumph .would you feel the same after ten years passed ?nobody can deny that having an energetic , heathy body is better than being frail , dependant on medicine or on someone .you ca nt try parachute jumping if you re past 60 .doctors would nt allow it .even the eating would nt be the same with lots of constraints .it s always easier to meet and get on well with new people as a young person .people accept and trust each other easily .it s simple to find common ground when you re young .older people tend to be more rigid in their views .traits and ideas begin to turn to stone .after a certain age it becomes impossible to change them .let s face it ; people do nt get wiser when they get old .they only get old , both in mind and the body .it s becomes harder and harder to deal with them so unfortunatly some families even consider to send them away .
