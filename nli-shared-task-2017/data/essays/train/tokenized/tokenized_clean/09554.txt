i do agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people have a lot of energy inside of them , that motivates them to go further into new fields and explore new ideas .and that physical power that help them to resist hard times .these explorations and resistance make them atchieve their goalstherefore enjoy life .while old people have nt got this energy and physical power to motivate them and lead them to theiir dreams .young people have this gift , inside of them , energy and physical power .this energy and physical power can motivate them and lead them to accomplish their own dreams , and by accomplishing their dreams , the term enjoying life is fullfield .for example , if a young man has the dream to become a doctor , inorder to cure sick people .therefore to become a doctor that requires alot of work and study .alot of people might say that he does nt enjoy life , but the true fact is that , he is enjoying life by doing the only thing he thinks will proff his existance and will improve from people s lives .on the other hand , if an old person had the same dream of becoming a doctor , will be very hard for him to accomplish it , because he does nt have that gift any more , the energy .without having the energy , he will struggle to accomplish his dream .i m not saying that he wo nt accomplish his dream , no what i mean is that he wo nt enjoy his life in order to accomplish his dream .he will fight against his poor resisting body in order to reach his dream .at last he did it , he accomplished what he was aiming to .but if we put the young and the old of this example in comparison , the two accomplished their dreams , but the young is the one who enjoyed life .he enjoyed the pleasure of using the energy inside of him in order to motivat him , so he may reach his goalto conclude , young people have a gift , they may use it or not , that depends to their inspiration to fullfil their dreams .this gift of energy and physical power gives them the opportunity to fullfil their dreams , on the other hand , old people lack these traits .
