` do good and do it well  .i firmly believe in this adage .i believe that an accomplishment in one academic subject can win laurels to an individual rather than basking in the falseglory  of being the ` jack of all trades  .according to me even if a person has has a broad knowledge rof many academic subjects , it is of no good .scientifically , the human mind can register information only to a certain extent .when the information is of diverse nature and quantity , the brain tends to faulter , hence creating chaos in the mind of the individual .this has an obvious impact-inadequate , misleading and incomplete information .besides the personal loss , it has a profound impact on the people around the individual .the people grasp the so - called ` information  , which is of no good to them , ultimately leading to incoherence in their minds too .this leads to a cumulative multiplication of misleading facts .it is analogous to an attempt to sail on two boats simultaneously .hence broad knowledge is not concise , not informative and at times misleading .it neither educates nor enlightens , infact it causes destruction in the long run .on the other hand , having specific , detailed knowledge regarding a subject not only satiates the individual , it is advantageous in the long run too .detailed knowledge regarding one subject leads to enhancement of personal skills .it fosters the individual with self confidence .specialisation enables a person to put his knowledge to practical use .for instance , a scientist can carry out research on an issue only when he is well informed regarding the issue .at that instant it his detailed knowledge regarding that subject which counts .if people did not have specific knowledge , innumerous mysteries would have remained unfolded .as a famous adage says , ` too many cooks , spoil the broth  according to me , too many thoughts in the mind can also produce disastrous effects .we can not expect an individual to be painter , historian and a scientist at the same time ; rather we better not .specialisation takes into account , scope for further improvement as well as further strenghtening of skills .so ultimately , its better to stick to one subject rather than misguiding yourself and the others by unneccesarily trying to gain knowledge
