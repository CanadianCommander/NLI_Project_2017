knowledgeable person is always acepted as a wealthy one in th society .as knowledge has no limits the broder the knowledge the broder is the thinking of the person .however , according to me having specialize subject knowledge is better than those of having of many subjects .specialized knowledge is always a boon , sharp and a didicated one for a person .as an example , scientist they have a broad knowldge but of a specfic subject on waht they are working on .as an example , my father is an mechnical engineer from the past en years is working in mechanical plant from then and now his mehanical skills have became sharp .few people think that having the knowledge of many subjects can help in knowing each thing better but , it is just a misconseption things dose nt work like that if u want to learn more u have to be very specific about the subject you take .for example , one my friend is very knowledgeable but not in the field of any specfic subject .one more example i would like to discuse is about engineering or graduate programs offered by the various schools .why there are different subjects in different programs because , to make a person specialized in a specific field of study .if a person have an deep knowledge of the subject of study he can contribute a lot more .example , astrnomers contribute there efforts towards the field of astropyhsics .another example , biologist he contributes towards the field of biology .but the person having a broad knowldge can not go so much specific about any subject .broad knowledge of diffrent subject help people in life but only in normal way not in any specific direction .hence , a specilized knowledge of a specfic field is more better then having a broad but genral knowledge of everything .
