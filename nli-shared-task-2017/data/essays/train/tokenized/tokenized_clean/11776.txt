i agreed with the position that  successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i have several reasons :1. the 20 century inventors try new things and take risks2. in my 15 years of univerties studies , i found in several books of scientists , universities magazines , that the people who wants to needs to be successful takes risk , risk in research , risk in budgets , contract , burse investment .3. you never can to do big money with the regular risks .never we can ear about people who are rich whith the regular risk .4. old things and no risk is a bad formula to be successful5. usa is a country championship in continuosly development new things and take risks .6. the united style of life in 500 year adopt the formula  new thing and take risks .i have several examples1. the industrial revolution start in between end of 1800 and 19002. the inventors invent in the 20 century more things than ever in the history .3. in the last times the more important example in the internetwith the internet the history of the world change :because each people in the world can acces the libraries and know about the diferent cultures .the people can learn othe idioms , the people can buy that the can from all around the world .and my favorites examples in the internet bussiness are :i. googles , now the cost of this company are billions of us $ii .yahoo , before googles was the most successfull company in internet .iii .pay pals , the partners bought this company in one billion dollars .iv .youtoube , this company was founded 18 months ago , and now was sell it in 1.300 billion dollars .this companys was developed successful peoply trying new things and taking risks . ..
