i could not agree more with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i believe that people should have knowledge in many areas because we face many problems and many situations through our lifes and if we have no idea about them we could face big problems .i am studying mathematics and i am learning everything about this subject at the university .however beside this subject i am attending many other courses to improve my knowledge in other subjects such as english , history , education and international relations .i am taking this courses because i will be a mathematic teacher after my graduation and i will teach children .my main subject will be mathematics in my job of course but children will ask me many questions in other subjects , too .for example they will see something on television and as a teacher i will be supposed to have knowledge about what they saw and they will ask me some questions .if i can not answer them in many situations they may loose their trust in me and this is a very bad situation for a teacher i think .another thing is that i am thinking about staying at the university as a teacher and in turkey one has to take some exams to be able to stay at the university and to be an academic teacher .to be successful in this exams i have to have ideas about some other subjects besides my major subject .to improve my knowledge in this subjects i have to be interested in them because it can be boring for me if i have to study something that i do not like and do not want to study .so , because of this reasons i have mentioned above i am taking many other subjects besides mathematics to improve myself and i believe this will help me to be successful in my job in the future .
