i do not believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years from now .my doubts are particularly fueled by the aspect of mobility which i believe to be having an even gaining influence on our lives .in the face of incessant globalization , people will most probably be more and more forced to be flexible in a physical sense .both the ability and the willingness to move and to have a long way to work will be essential in the world of tomorrow even more than they are today .higher mobility will naturally require more cars .the main argument against the continuing spread of vehicles may and can be seen in the environmental issues affected by their use .the certainly ever-growing awareness of these often ferocious environmental downsides will for sure have a long distance effect on people bying cars .but i believe that this will only be the case if car manufacturers will not succeed in developing cars with considerably less harmful environmental side-effects than they have today .if these corporations , however , do achieve this goal on an effective scale , and there is at least some reason to believe they do , i am convinced people will not be deteriorated from bying cars in any way .but i believe not only the improved environmental issues to be a potentially enhancing factor on car sales .looking at the technological development of the last hundred years , it seems quite plausible to assume that cars will keep becoming less and less expensive , at least as far as low - and mid level cars are concerned .i believe that the car will not only pursue but also broaden its dominance as a mass product , increasingly reaching more and more potential customers .naturally , my argument is only convincing if the automobile industry finds a both affordable and effective way of reducing the devastating effects of cars with regards to air pollution , i.e. global warming .one may , of course , doubt whether the industry is willing and capable of reaching this goal .if not , customers will certainly shy away more and more from the car as an every-day item that we use even where not necessary .in the case of the latter , people will , i believe , be way more sensible in their conduct in twenty years , probably to a degree at which this sensitivity even effects their consuming habits .in the face of global warming , i would certainly support such a change .
