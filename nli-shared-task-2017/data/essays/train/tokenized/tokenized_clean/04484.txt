technology has revolutionized our lives i.e. the way we live , the way be preceive . .everything has changed with the advent of modern innovations .we have become accustomed to this technology in our everyday lives be it a referigerator , washing machine , radio etc .in fact it is impossible to think life without these things .modern technology has given us pace .it has developed modern means of transport for fast movement .the cars , trains and areoplanes etc all are gifts of technologycars .this is a quite familiar name in day to day life .in fact every middle class home owns atleast one car , car has become more of a necessity in today s life .moreover , to a some degree it also has become a sort of status commodity .but that does not hide the imprtance of cars in in our day to day life .in life where time is everything cars are one of the fastest means of transport .cars are required at family outings .thus car is an indispensable part of our day to day life .but , although technology has aided us , it is also leading to dangerous results .take for an instance , technology has made living more comfortable resulting in decline in health problems and cosequently increase in population .thus this large population is a large pressure on our resources .our oil resources are depleting at a rapid rate and perhaps be exhausted in another thirty years or so .with their exhaustion , cars , which run on petrol , will be of no use to us thus declining resources has forced us to look for alternatives which employ better utilization of these resources .thus the railways , trams come into picture .in fact twenty years will now , there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .with the scarcity of petroleum products , it would become quite difficult to afford a car at that time .the people will go for cheaper means of transport .now a days people has become aware of this thing and already have started using public transport more often .thus the car purchase has fallen .in twenty years time the existing cars would be disposed off due to the finishing of their utilization period .this will also see an decline in number of cars .thus it has been clearly proved in the passage that with declining petroleum products , car quantities would fall in the time period to come
