i disagree with the statement , that it is better to have wide knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i believe that jack of all will never be master of none .broad knowledge over many subjects will never make any person perfect .in the competetive world people are preferred with specialiation rather than with out any specialiation .broader knowledge in many subjects is good but one should have specialiation in his majors , so that he can find a good career in the particular subject .phd is the high academic degree , and those with phd s are very specialised in a particular subject .they are considered to be the experts in that particular field .they have wide oppurtunities due to their expertise .most of the higher degrees require to do a specialisation in a particular subject .it is because to make the student perfect in that particular field which will help him to build a good career .in the world most the discoveries and inventions are made by the subject experts , who have a good knowledge in the particular field of invension .all these invensions are possible only because of their specialization .usually in schooling we will be learning many academic subjects to get familarize with them and to know in which subject we have interest .later we will be choosing interested subjects and will do a specialisation in that particular subject .all the companies require experts in particular field , a person having a broader knowledge in various subjects will not be considered as a competent person for a particular job .i believe getting a broader knowledge in various subjects is very difficult , and more over it will not fetch even .most of the universities are preferring to produe students with higher degrees who hava a specialisation .this indicates the importance of having a specialisation .in conclusion i believe a specialisation in particular subject is very much use ful for career and ultimately for the beterment of life .
