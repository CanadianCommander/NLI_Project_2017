i disagree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .of course , i know the effects of advertisements .for example , when we look for the productions which we need , we always use advertisements with the beautiful picture and handsome models .according to these effect , those productions look like better , and we are moved on our lust .but personaly , i think that these situations are changed nowadays , because we can check the information of products from the various news source .i would like to explain by two examples .firstly , there are lots of advertisements in the world .also , these are not just by paper or pamphlet .by using internet , we can search those products easily and find lies or difference which the publisher of advertisements declare .secondly , at present , we can compare with other products , because we can take a lot of information from many advertisements .so , we do not buy the matter easily .for example , yesterday , i needed the desk lamp to study my major hard , and at first , i read the information about the lamp which i can buy from internet , and at next i looked in the phamphlet to get day before yesterday , when i went to the shop .then i went to one mole near my accomodition , and bought it .on this process , i checked and compared the product which i bought with other products again and again .and i could take the information about the real product .therefore , i do not agree with that statement .
