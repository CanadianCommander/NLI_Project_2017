i totally agree with this statement .people who are successful are people who do not hesitate to take risks in order to achieve their goals .it does not mean that they are affraid of nothing .but they estimate the risks and then decide to take it or not .there are some good examples that we can give to explain that point of view :in business , we know that people who measure risks and take some will be successful businessmen .the director of the virgin company richard brandson is someone who did took risks to succeed in creating such a huge and modern company .after selling cd , dvd , travelling tickets , mobile phones , and sodas , he is now selling tickets for a trip in a spaceship .this guy also tried already 3 times to travel around the globe in his virgin balloon .in sports , we all know that people who take big risks will be the best : in formula one for example , the drivers are risking their life to win a tournament .in football , a player like zidane is successful because he does not hesitate to take risks in front of other really good players .and it is the same in all sports .and when we think about arts , we can say that the major artists of our century are the one who took risks to do new things .picasso for example knew really well how to paint realistics pictures but he decided after a certain period of time to change for a new way of painting .and moliere was hated by the public of his own time because he created a new kind of theatre .he took also a big risk .in conclusion we can say that not taking risks does not help being successful .what is important is too measure the risk we take and assume the results it will give .
