i desagree the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there is today .the car is one of the evolution that is the most use by the population .have a car is very comon ; you can find cars all around the world even in poor countries .we will see why car are not ready to deseapper , firstly , because they is no solution to replace cars , then that have a car become very ship , and finaly because now people things car .firstly , there is no invention that can replace cars .it is true that there is the bus , the tramway , the metro , but that is different you do not feel the same when you take your car alone and when you share a bus .cars is a need for many people to have their privacy , their confort .car permit you to be free ; go where and when ever you want .that the most important thing , and for the moment nothing can replace it .secondly , having a car is no more a luxury but a need .the cost of a car become less and less expensive .we can take the example of the new 4x4 build in china that it the less expensive 4x4 never built .the only things expensive is the gas , but solution like  biological gas  from colsa for example .or more common , car which work with electricity .so there is solution of the high cost of the gas .finaly , nowadays people get a car as soon as they have their driver licence ; so they make their life with cars advantages .nobody will wanted stoping using his car before we find others ways to move .our car have a long life , sorry for the earth environemt
