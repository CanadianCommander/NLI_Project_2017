with this essay i will try to explain why i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now .when one looks at consolidated automobile markets such as the usa or europe , one finds that even though the number of cars in use has not increased substantially over the last decade , neither has the number declined .even though other types of fuel might substitute the gas used nowadays , there is no sign of another , more effective way of transportation .therefore it is very likely that the number of automobiles in europe and the usa will remain constant for the next twenty years .on a worldwide scale , i think that the number of cars will increase drastically over the next two decades .emerging countries , especially in the asian region such as singapore are showing two-digit growth rates in the number of cars used .even though this development will eventually slow down in these countries , we will still see substantially more cars in these regions in the future .while only looking at consolidated or emerging markets one can already imagine , that the number of cars in use will not decline within the next twenty years .there are however countries such as china or india , that will be the major drivers of a stark increase in the number of automobiles .these two countries alone make up a great part of the worldwide population , while the majority of people in these countries do not yet possess cars .in china we can slowly observe what will happen in both countries in the future .namely an immense increase in vehicles .the development in these two countries alone will lead to a dramatic increase in cars used worldwide .as a wrap up i can say that i do not only disagree with the statements that fewer cars will be in use twenty years from now , but that coming two decades will show an increase in automobiles used worldwide .
