the contemporary society requests people to be very focused on their own goals , and achieving better positions is possible only if you are available to find the best solution to your problems every day .in my opinion , i completely agree with the given statement , according to which if one wants to be successful , he or she should follow new ways to deal with his or her matters , and also being available to take risks .i can support my judgement with examples from my personal experience , expecially if i consider my studies and my work .like my father and my uncle , i graduated in architecture , so i was expected to start working as a building architect , but i did not like that idea at all .in fact , as i have been fond of gardening since the age of fourteen , i wanted to became a landscape architect , in order to plan parks and gardens rather than civil buildings .consequently , i attended two post-graduate courses in landscape architecture and now i have the right qualification to plan them .moreover , i have started a phd in that specific field , because i am very interested in pursuing an academic career at university .if i had followed my father and uncle s path , i would have lost my unique chance to do what i really prefer .but there is also another positive aspect .considering that i knew lots of roman students where i attended my masters , i decided that it was better for my career to open a new associated atelier in rome to start working as a landscape architect .it was really risky , because it requested a considerable amount of money and we had not enough work at the beginning , but i was determined .now , i can state that we are quite successful , and this fact makes me very happy .if i had continued to work at my father s studio , i would never have been able to achieve this success .all considered , i suppose that it can be easily understood why i think that successful people need to try new activities or ways to achieve their goals , even if they are risky , rather than following their previuos experiences .my aim to become a landscape architect has been reached only giving new directions to my life .in conclusion , i have no hesitation in recommending young people to keep this statement in their mind .
