nowadays , it is more common to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but it does nt mean that it is the best way to travel and discover a country .the fact that you are dependent of a group and that you have not the possibility to meet native people are reasons which explain why i do nt think that travelling in a group is good .firstly , when you travel in a group , you are not independent .you can not visit monuments and places that you want .you have to follow the group and the schedules which are provided by the tour guide .for exemple , if you want to eat in a specific restaurant , you have to ask the permission to the guide and come back in a specific time .another thing is that if you are exhausted and you need to have some rest , you can not not do it because of your appartenance to the group .secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide does nt permit to discover the culture of a country and to meet native people .in general , when you stay in group , you have to go in a specific hotel .you have not the opportunity to sleep in an bed and breakfast .tour guide will show you the most common or famous place , but not the secret and amazing places of a contry .in touristic trips , you can not be immerged in the culture or be in relation with the abits of the natives .even if yo are in a different country , you stay with people who are the same heritage .to conclude , i think that the best way to travel is to organize a trip by yourself .even if it requieres more efforts , i am sure that you will apreciate your trip much better than if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .
