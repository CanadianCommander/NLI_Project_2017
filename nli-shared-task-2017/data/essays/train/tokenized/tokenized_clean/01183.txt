enjoy life at every ageall people in a society can not be happy with the conditions or lifestyles that they are living in .this may be based on the socio-economic conditions or spiritual reasons .there is common belief in public that , young people are enjoying their life rather that the older peole .this is totally incorrect , since these kind of generations can not be applied to every society .the level of enjoying life is determined by the level fulfillment of wishes , not with the level of age .to start with , we should look at the age groups and their lifestyles in the society .for instance countries like germany has a high rate of old people .in contrast , countries like turkey has a high level of young peole .but , it can not be said that that wish fulfllment of young people in turkey is greater than germany .the social and economic conditions may bring joy for the older people in an industrialized country .it is not surprising that older people from those countries are travelling around the world and having fun .it is obvious that , they are having the greatest time in their life , since they do not have any reason to worry about .they living peacefully and with lack of stress .in other words , they are enjoying life more than younger people .to go one stage further , working young people should be considered .in deveolping countries and even in industrial countries people are forced to work at early ages .this is because of the financial requirements .they have to prove themselve in the society and start earning money .otherwise , they can not stand in the against the hard rules ofthe capitalist economies .ailtougt there are cases that young people are enjoying their life by going to clubs , bars , or spend most of their time on entertainment but somehow they have to start working and face with the truths of the wild world .in addition to this , most ofthe young people , who has been seen like having fun infact performing aroleplay .the latent tru inside is toatally different .to sum up , when all the things above are taken into consideration , the generalization in a society that expresses the level of satisfaction .it is obvious that people are enjoying life at any age that is most suitable for them .
