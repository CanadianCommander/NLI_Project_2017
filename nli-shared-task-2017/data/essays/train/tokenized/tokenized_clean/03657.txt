before going to the topic it is necessary to define the terms ideas , concepts and facts .ideas on the first hand are the basis for innovation .without idea there will not be any advancement in the curren technology frontiers .a good idea may change the way of our life .on the other hand concept is what we develop from the idea .simply speaking concept is the paper work for an idea .this theoritcal statement will gude the application of the idea .coming to the factswhick unlike ideas and concepts will mostly reveal what actually happens in a phenomina .i do agree with the question for several reasons .one reason is without a proper base or idea how come a student learn a subject or what will be there to reveal .so it is required for a student to learn both the ideas and concepts .for example let us suppose there is a mistireous entity or a phenomina that is unknown like the `` dark matter  in the outer space .as no information is available about it or even its existence is doubted then it is necessary to assume several properties even without knowing proper facts .this is possible by devoloping a solid concept over the entity that will eventually give rise to ideas about the entity and its behaviour .for instance let us assume that there is no information available about the dark matter .then what facts can be revealed about it without any phenomina stating its existence .only the concept changes when the original facts are revealed .so it is highly necessary to learn ideas and concepts before knowing their facts .and the concepts which arise from ideas help in moulding our future .`` ideas are what we are living and ideas are what we are made of ...and ideas are bullet proof  .
