in the first years of the car , you could hardly saw it on the streets .after the time spent , this have expirienced an enormous change .nowadays it is imposible to get out of your house in the city and not to see a car .nevertheless , people are now taking into concern how damageful it is and are trying to improve it .for instance , vitoria ( spain ) .it was a poluted city , with no streets for walking ang lots of cars in them .therefore , children had no save places to play .nevertheless , this city is having a big change .first of all , the city center .some years before it was absolutly full of cars and noise .there were also lots of arguements between drivers due to there were no places to park their cars . ..but now , the city center is only for walkers .cars are forbidden on it , which is wonderful .in additon , more parkings are available for cars as lot of places to park have been removed .but it is great that now people who want to get in the city center can park on a very cheap parking and can walk to any place they want to go .the example of this city must be followed by the rest of the cities as it is having a fantastic result in the citizens .to my concern , it may be difficult in cities such as new york or madrid but i think in a few years this problem will be improved in many places of the world .consequently , the enviroment , which is very damaged due to the fact that we are overusing the car and the rest of poluting objects , will be improved .therefore , our children will have a better world to live in and they will also learn from us that they need to look after the environment .
