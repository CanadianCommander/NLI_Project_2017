the new generation of people are more self involve .if we get to understand them then we can see their evolution towards egocentrism .the world has opened its frontiers since airplanes , trains and bosts are accessible and less expensive then used to be .people get to travel more , their nomad live bring them to dicover new places , new civilisations but not to get involve in a community .they basicaly lock themselves up and do nt even see what is out there .so helping the community they live in is not a priority .there are a lot of political issues that are involved in the negligance or even distruction of communities , like povrety , immigration , taxes , unimployment , ...all of these factors contribute in the young peoples  actions .to help our entourage , we first have to like it and feel appart of it .and in most cities the most of the time people do nt like where they live , they ca nt afford better so they just do nt even care .if we compare it to the last generation which lived all their lives in the same house , with the same neibours , they were more involved in the well being of their community .they were helping people and loving ones .but they felt they belonged there , they just got over a war and were just happy with what they had .but as for today , wealth is a priority in life , education leeds us there .we get an education to be buy things we do nt need but want .and for that we tends to want more , an addiction like the saying says `` time is money  .and greed comes with carelessness .being appart of the young people , i get to be confronted every day with persons whom couldnt care less about people and communities .but knowing that this kind of toughts are just selfish and worthless , i try to get out of this stereotypic generation and tend to be less self involved in what ever i do and where ever i go .
