no , i do nt agree with this statement .because , now a days present technology is improved a lot .peoples are introducing four wheelars with different modles and different infrastructure .not only this four wheelar two wheelars also .now a days buying a car became a prestige issue .so , every people going to buy a car if they had enough money .most of the people in the society feel that if they have a car then only people respect them .now a days there is a no person without a car those who had enough money .people now a days only using cars large in number .so if u consider the future day-to-day technology is improving a lot .so , people are crazy about buying a car , especially recently setled people .in olden days people were craze about buying a bike when they got settled .but the present situation is not like that , people are paying more intrest on cars not bikes .i want to share my one of the personal experience .consider my uncle , working as an advocate only .all of his colleagues in the court are bought a car .so , inoder to show his prestige issue he simply applied for a loan and he bought a car .he consider it as prestige issue .not only my uncle people in the society are consider it as a prestige issue .i want to share my another example , i had a friend .she is younger to me .she got a job in software industry when i am in b.tech first year .before she got settled she always told me that `` i like bike very much , so when i got settled i will buy a bike  .but two years back she bought a car .then i asked her , sister two years back you are crazy about a bike , but now you buy a car what is the reason .then she replied me `` ohhhh , where are u my dear now a days people are more crazy about cars not bikes , that s why i bought a car , its also a prestige issue for me  .so , what i conclude is according to the present technology and thoughts of a person ( he/she ) definitely after twenty years the usage of cars will be increased a lot .
