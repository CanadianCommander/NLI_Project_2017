no community can exist if the young do not take an active part in its development .saying that young people do not give time to help their communities would be wrong .the fact that the young generation enjoys the life and lives it up has created a wrong impression that they are not serious about their communities .but if we look carefully then we ll realise the role the youngsters are playing in the development of their communities .i remember when i was in school , we were made to go to the slum areas and help the children over there to learn to read and write .camps were organised by students to educate the locals of a village on the importance of education .all these initiatives were taken by the students who form the bloodline of any community .another example that i can recollect of the youngster s role in a community is when i went for a vacation to a small town by the sea .the authorities had allowed breaking of a ship that contained asbestos which is harmful to humans .it was the effort of the young people of the community that that ship was made to return and a community was saved .therefore , the youngsters do care about their communities and play an important role in defining how a community should be rather than just being a part of it and accepting it the way it was given to them .
