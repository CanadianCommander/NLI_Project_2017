people , espeally ordinary people , often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already khow how to do well .i strongly believe that most honored people like to do something new one .most of successful people are curious .they always think about that which people are not intersted in. as people know , the chief of sony company is the best example .when he was young , he thought he listens to the radio not only staying at home , but only walking down street .so , finally he made sony walkman .he became known person and successful person .they also have a dream themselves and they do that what they try to do new things .they were embitionce .and if they decided somthing , they never give up .of course , all of them are not like that .some successful people like to do what they already know how to do well .but others are not afraid to faced with new things .indeed , they could do that what they want .taking all of these things into account , successful people would like to try new things and take risks .
