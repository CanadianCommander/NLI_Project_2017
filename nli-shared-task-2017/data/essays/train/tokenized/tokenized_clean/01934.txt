i agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .the most important part of learning is its application .just the knowledge of facts wont take an indivisual to summit of success .it is when someone can throughly get hold of the idea and concepts , he can create , understand , and anallize things better .one can not limit ideas and concepts they can be extended to any dimenssions but on the other hand facts can be concidered just a summarization of the ideas and concepts .facts are important as they provide the basic fundamental thinking but they are not the most important one .if a student just limit himself with the facts he stops thinking , thinking in a new dimenssion .one stops reasoning himself and try wheather there could be another theory which could support the idea , is a theory fulproof .all these questions are not asked .the person cajole oneself to belive it without questioning .the basis of human existence is to think and work on ideas and concept .if the fact that earth is flat as initialy propossed was relied on , then we would have never known the truth .but it is this understanding of idea and concept that the atom contain smaller elements inside we have discovered protons , nutrons and even smaller than that .nature is too complex to understand and whatever is not natural can be wrong .facts about anything can be printed in textbooks , narrated by teachers but understanding of ideas and concept depends upon ones own perception , once own logical reasoning and that is what real education is about , to think to reason and then to act .
