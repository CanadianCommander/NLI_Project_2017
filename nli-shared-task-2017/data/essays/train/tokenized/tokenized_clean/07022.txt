an often discussed problem in our times is the pollution of the environment caused by carbondioxide , which occured by the great number of cars used all over the world .so to have a look in our future a lot of well-known scientists try to answer this question for us : how would the situation change in the next 20 years ?will there be fewer cars then now ?to discuss this in proper way , we first have to name some pros and cons underlining this theory .first of all to have a look at the negative site of this question .in 20 years the development of the tramsport system will not be far enough to reduce the number of cars used by people .furthermore there are so many automotive companies which benefit from the profit made by the car industry and there are also thousands of jobs , so that the government can not stop the trend of increasing numbers of cars , if they do nt want the unemplyment figurs to rise .on the other hand there are some facts supporting the idea of a future with fewer cars .on of them is the great number of giant projects like the `` transrapid  ( train ) , which show that a movement in an environment friendly way is possible .another , more important fact is : `` we are running out of resources , like crude oil !!  , which are important for the production of gasolin .if there is no fuel , nobody can use his car , and the secondary resources like electricity , etc. are not enough developed .but the most important , and at the same time worrying fact is , that our environment is badly polluted , which means that we have to face a time where the governments of our world have to react , not like the us , in person of g.w. bush is behaving concerning the kyoto protocoll .there will be new laws introduced to our society , regulating the usage time of a car per person per day .or for exemple the regulation that one family is only allowed to have one car .so to sum up , it will be hard to realize this wish , but with an optimized concept and the co-operation of all countries , a realistic chance exists .
