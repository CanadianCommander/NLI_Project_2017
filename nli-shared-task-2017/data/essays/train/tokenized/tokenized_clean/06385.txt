can we imagine a day without advertisements ?advertisements are nowaday a big part of our economy .a business plan have to be prepared with a specific policy as regard advertisement .i agree with this statement for many reasons .first , in my opinion , something advertised is presented to the population as the best one in its best presentation .it occur when we seean advertisement for foods .when you have the food in your plate , you appreciate the difference .then , most pepole a credule .they have not the knowledge to compare or to juge the product .principally the old person when they have to buy for example a television .next , an other big part of the population is very influenced by advertisement .they see it , buy it thinking that is the best and seek the difference with an other different .as long as the rules do not change , the advertisement system will still edge up .
