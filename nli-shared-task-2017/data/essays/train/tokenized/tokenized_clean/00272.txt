it is a difficult question , but for me , the choice is clear .i disagree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two reasons ; the prevention of the reallity and the conclution of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers .the first reason is the prevention of the reallity .it is based on the situation that customers ordinally make a judge from the advertisement whether they buy it or not .i think advertisements should be besed on the products .the role of the advertisements is telling customer what the products rally are and what points are distinguish on other products .the advertisements should be neesded the reallity of the products .the second reason is the construction of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers .the advertisement explains about the product , so the custmer can buy it without anxious .those are my opinions .thus , i disagree the following statement .
