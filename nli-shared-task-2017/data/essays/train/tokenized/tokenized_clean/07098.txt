every coin has two sides .although some people may think that successful people do what they already know how to do well , i believe that successful people try new things and take risks , as i will explain below .the first reason why i agree with this statement is because brave is the characteristic of successful people .there is little room to debate .people who can takes new challenges in stride is a successful person .for example , some inventors success since they try to create a new invention .they need brave to experience the failure , and then research how to make a useful thing for people .therefore , successful people need brave to try new things and take risks .the second reason why i agree with this statement is because the people only do what they already know how to do well may be limited to develope .with the rapid development of society , new things appear quickly .people contribute their knowledge ; however , some people just do the same thing .they just want to do the things they already know .in my opinion , it s selfish .for instance , when a group discuss how to make the report look impressive , some will put their best foot forward to think about that and try to make a special way , but others do nt participate the discussion .if that , how can we make the things be better ?finally , based on the above discussion and analysis , i strongly believe the ideas that successful people try new things and take risks rather than onlt doing what they already know how to do well .
