i agree the idea about young people enjoy life mor than older people do .there are several reason why i think that .the first reaonson , the young people are not the responsability than older people .may be older people have children .all the people know that there is not easy to educate children .all the time he try to give a very good condition for life .the second reason , the young , her aims is to go to th the club , cinema with her girls friend etc . ..and to get much experiences , so its very exited but the older people have passed this feeling .the thrrt reason , i think the most important moment fot the older people , when they were young .because when you grow up , the difficulty of life incrase and also the responsability increase .in peculiar , when you have the children , you have a new situation and new life .all your past became souvenirs .i brief , of carse the young people enjoy life more than older people do because it is logicaly and i gave these reasons why i thinks that .
