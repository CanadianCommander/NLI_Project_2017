i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only do what they already know .i have specific reasons for my opinion .which mainly support the idea of success and development .the first an most important reason is , that i strongly connect success with challange .in order to have a success i need to have a challange .you can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate .he is doing this every day , without any change .therefor he has no challange , because he has done this several times and knows what to to .without the challange he can not show a success and wo nt be recognized by anyone .the second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful .everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular , new or difficult .in order to do new and difficult things , i need to know my capabilities .these capabilities will need training .hence if i do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities , i have less possibilities to choose of .therefore i am limited in the things i can solve .in contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which leads to be more successful .the third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful .for example your boss will test you before he promotes you .he will give you things to do that are new for you .for that you will have to take risks to solve this problems .therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful .i had this often in my personal career .my boss tested me and gave me difficult tasks .he was not mainly intrested in the result of the task , but how i did it .in conclusion , success needs people to take risks , move to unknown territories and try new things .without this there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognition of others .i do encourage everyone to take risks and try new things whenever you can .
