there is no doubt that car is the mainstream of transportation in modern times .although still cars are incredibly increasing nowadays , i believe that use of car will decrease in the future time .i will present briefly two reasons to support my opinion .first of all , polution problem it occurs is a serious issue in the past and also future time .goverments are making a strict schedule to control cars and pollutant it mades recent years .many experiments and results already showed that serious air pollution caused by car can cause lung cancer and lead human to death .it is a problem that conflict with humans health even to humans survival , strong limitation of using car will made in the future time .it is not a matter of only human matter of earth s .furthermore , new transportation that is more convenient and do not make any pollutant will invent in the future time .already many scientists and experts of car started its  invention .recently invented electronic and hydrogen transportation is a fine example of thisinvention .they use electricity or water for their fuel to run which does nt make any pollutant to the air .one problem is it s price but development of technology will solve it naturally .invention of car was a revolutionary one to human kinds .however it threaten humans lives recent time .limitation of it s use and invention of new transportation is necessary .i believe that humans will chose to stop using car naturally in the future time according to above mentioned reasons : it s pollution problem and appear of new transportation .
