humankind lives for the pursuit of happiness as long as it has got rid of what could seem to us a trivial point : the struggle for survival .kant affirms that the doxa happiness has nothing in common with what philosophers considered as happiness .according to the doxa , eg , the common opinion , people have reached happiness when they could enjoy freely life .to be happy all life long you need to enjoy all life long .nonetheless , even this restricted vision of happiness does nt seem easy to reach .when are we able to freely enjoy in our life ?can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?first we may consider indeed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .the mantra of youth could be : life is short , party hard .they are young , they have many time to spend .their behaviour toward life is therefore candide , they have no responsabilities .they think they are able to do whatever they want , even faults , thanks to the fact that they are young .so they enjoy life in their way : overdrinking , overdancing . ..no matter , they are inconscious !nonetheless , this is a very contemporan phenomenon .for centuries until the fifties , youngs should work in the very begining of their life .they were not considered at all as king-child as we do .such a statement should have seemed to everybody aukward : the only period of the life one could have been able to enjoy , if not belonging to the high part of society , was the elderly when they had enough money to think to someting else than working .nowdays things are different but i do nt think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .they should enjoy life louder but that s it .older people have learned to enjoy life differently , for instance by building a family or taking care of it , by enjoying every single moment of what we could call happiness .
