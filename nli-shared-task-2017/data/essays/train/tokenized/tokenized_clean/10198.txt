there s a truth that some advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but there are still some of them are the same as they really are .it s difficult to directly say that whether most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , there are only a few people make advertisements seem much better than the advertisements really are nowadays , and also in the future .advertisements are used for introducting the stuffs what are expected to sell , so if the advertisements makers show people some real advertisements .there will be many people who are glad to buy .there wo nt be a problem that if people have known the things well , because after they have spent their money once , thet will believe these advertisements , and maybe some of people will regard them as their favourate , whatever which kind of advertisements they are .for example , food , tools or electrical equipments .they ll be sold well , and the sellers will get a lot of money in the future because their honest in the advertisements .so it s good to make advertisements as real as they are .we have to believe that nowadays there are also some sellers who make advertisements much better than they really are .at first , a lot of people do nt know the advertisements a lot , so maybe the sellers can increse the prise and earn a lot of money in the beginning .later , after everyone has known the truth of the advertisements , how can the sellers get money continue ?they can not !all in all , i think that not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
