our parents used to tell us not to stick to only onething and try to experience and face everything in our lives .at schools studentd were taught different kinds of languages in order to try to communicate easily and diffrently .i agree that a person can be better at one knowledge rather than not succeding on alot of knowledges but on the other hand having broad knowledge means communication , experience and opening to other culturesbeing specialized in one specific subject ; will lead the person to a one way direction , lesser oppurtunities , narrow minded and it will really be difficult to communicate with other cultures and different traditions .people and especially profetionals can tell easily wether a person is well acadimwkly or not which ofcourse gives a huge honor for the person first , sometimes it becomes really hard at your country and you dont find the job that suits you .so if you are a person who studied more than subject you will defenitly understand how other bussiness runs around the world .you will be able to find a job abroadsecond , each subject depending on where does it come from has it s own way of thinking and aquires different traditions so it s not only about a language it s about turning your mind with many issues .you will be able to undeestand , communicate , realize the reasons beyond each and every culture way of thinking and causes for there thinking that way .the person will eventually learn to comprimize and understandas a conclusion , sucsses comes from experience which comes from kknowledge .so a person must be aware of all issues around and build his mind by feeding in many subjects
