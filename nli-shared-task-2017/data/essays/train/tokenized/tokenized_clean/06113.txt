there are several reasons why it is believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .because of their freedom recentely discoverd and the amazing and new oportunities that keep appearing all the time .because of this time of exploration that youth has , i can affirm that young people enjoy life more than older people .young people feel free to do what they want .they are in a period of discovering new things and finding out their path and knowing who they really are .because old people have already established a life style , with bigger responsabilities , they are not especting anything and their experimental time has passed .nevertheless , older people have their own wat to enjoy life , but i can not tell it because i have not experimented the adult period yet .as a youth , i can affirm that i enjoy life because i take advantage of every new adventure that came out , and i dont have much bigger responsabilities than university .in addition , university is enjoyable when you learn and at the same time , make friends and have fun with them .it is the time in which you share your moments of joy with others .young people are independiently .they have the wings to fly werever they want , travell in and outside the country , work in different places only for experience and not because of financial needs .youngs aspire for the future and project themself , so they still have hopes and views , and live their life especting and enjoying .however , not all youngs have a pleasent life .there are young people in the streets , homeless , and definetely not enjoying life as many other youths .in conclussion , the adolecense period is fun , but the truth is that each period has their benefits .old people find their way to enjoy life too , as well as kids and babies .the key is in enjoying every moment , because the present is a gift called present .
