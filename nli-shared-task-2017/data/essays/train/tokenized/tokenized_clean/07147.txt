these days , people need more information and knowledge to live .it is clear that having more information and knowledge is good to us , so many students who are studying at a university choose more than one major .but i do nt agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than speciallizing in one specific subject .i think it is nt always true .first , we can not develope our view about some specific subject if we effort to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , because it is difficult to study various subject and corrently specialize all of them .so we just know about lots of things , but can not be a experts in that fields .in my case , before a few months , i was majoring english language and literature too , but now i m only majoring in japanese literature .bemost people speciallize some knowledge while they attend university .it is not enough ti
