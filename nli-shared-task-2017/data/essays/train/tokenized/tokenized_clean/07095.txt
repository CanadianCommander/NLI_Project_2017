nowadays , many people want to success in their life .some people try to do very special thing that other people do nt try because they think that it is a way to make them better than other people .i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first , successful people try to do new thing and take risks because they want to resist themselves from the life .we live our life that is composed of continuous challenges .there is no way to avoid these challenges .if someone ignore the challenges , they will be a loser .not only this reason but also successful people want to examine themselves .they do nt like such a flat and normal matter and they want to improve themselves .also , they love themselves so they do nt want themselves to be lazy .it is really important point .second , successful people try new things and take risks because they do nt afraid of other people s saying .after people do the things successfully , they feel self-confidence .it is such an important part of our life .if someone already succeed in some area , people will be admire him .however , if he fails in the other area , people will ignore him more than before he succeed .actually other people is not the whole part of his life .they are just part of his life .successful people know this so they do nt really mind other people .if we try new things and take risks , we can improve ourselves more and more .we can feel self-confidence , too .success is not a whole part of our life , but we need it to make life better .if we try to make our life better , it will be great even though we fail in some area .
