as it to the best way to travel , diffrent people hold different ideas due to different personality and experience .personally , i do not agree with the satement that it is the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide .people agree with that statement believe that travel with group led by a quide will help them miss none of the scene site and they have someone take charge of problems .they also believe they will be benefit from tour guide since they are not familiar with the palce they plan to visit .however , i have hundres of reasons and example to argue back .the most important reason support my argument is that tour guide may take you to all of the scene sites bu by a very fast speed .last year , i joined a group organized by a travel agent to hangzhou for two days  tour .the guide took us round more than fifities resort sites aroung hangzhou in less than 15 hours which means we spended no more than 20minutes for each sites including laoding from big bus and rushing through the entrances and even shopping at high prices .that fast speed exhausted everyone the the way to finish the assignments , no let enjoy the beautiful natural and historical view in hangzhou .moreover some tour guides takes you to some shopes to encourage you spend more money on the sites .most of my friends complain a lot when they buy a lot of useless under the situiations of constant persuide by their tour guides .in addition , people do not need to be worried about the un-familiar place .before i start to travel with my friends to a new place , we first collect information and print the local mapto take along .then make a plan and prepare things for traveling like cell phones , bateries , driver liscences and some other neccessaies .travel alone or with friends has alot of enjoyment especailly drive by cars yourself .last weekend , when we drove our cars from burbank to lasvegas , we ran from the morning through the rural area to un-famouse natural lake , and passed by a vast desert , at last we saw a round and big moon hanging clost to the lasvegas city .all the way , we enjoy the changes of day and the nature , as well as the friendship .we drove alternatively in turn and everybody took their responsibility like a team group with no cheating and hurring .above alll the reasons and examples that i could not be enough to say that the best way to travel is with friends but it is definitely safe to draw the conclusion that travel in a group led by a tour guide is never could be a best way to travel
