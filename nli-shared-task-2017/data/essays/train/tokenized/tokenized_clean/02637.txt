i disagree with the statement , `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .the following points mentioned below supports my argument that , number of cars will increase in twenty years .one of the most important thing that contritubuted to the drastic increase in the number of cars is there easy availability in the market .fourty years ago in india , only two types cars were available , namelly , ambassdor and premeier padmini .one has to place and order to buy a car and used to get the car delivered six months later the order was placed .there was a monopoly existing in the market at that time and and it existed till late 1980 s in india .once the phenomena globalisation has been started , it made possible for the customer to have several options when buying a car and has enabled many people were able to buy cars .the ever increasing banking sector also contributed to the increase in the number of cars since last ten years .getting finance from a bank to buy a car is lot easy now than it was some ten years ago .in a recent survey conducted in hyderabad , the capital city of state of andhra pradesh in india , it was observed the number of cars were increased by 20 % compared to the previous year .a mojority of people who bought new cars that year had availed finance from banks .this point corroborates that availability of easy finance to buy cars will help increasing the nubmer of cars being used .off late , the booming it sector had fetched many people well paid jobs .many of these employed people have been purchasing cars .this factor also contributed the rise in the number of car users .this has happened in the last ten years and seems to grow more strongly in the coming years with the ever expanding it industry .one more thing which also influences the number of cars being purchased is their ever decreasing price as a result of the price war between several manufacturers in the market .now in the present scenario , lot of options are available for the customer at a relatively low price compared to earlier .which is driving more people to buy cars for their use .all the points mentioned above had happened over the past ten years and there are no reasons for that trend to go the other way .i think i am well placed to conclude that number of cars in use will increase in the coming years rather than decreasing .
