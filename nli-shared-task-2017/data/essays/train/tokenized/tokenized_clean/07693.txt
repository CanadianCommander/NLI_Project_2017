personally , i would agree with this statement , and the raesons are fairly simple .facts alone can not help you much , a better understanding of concepts will help in the developing of new ideas , and if we only focus on facts , we will miss the big picture .facts alone can not help anyone alone .an ideal example would be a detective tryiong to solve a crime .let s say the detective have all the facts he got all the information or evidence he needs , but he still needs to understand these facts and evidence .he will needs a reason for the crime , an understanding of human feelings and reactions to certain situation because without a good understanding these all the evidence and information are worthless .a complete understanding of the concepts will help us create new ideas .for example .imagine a scientist trying to come with anew theory of the atom .these scientist needs to understand all of the concepts and reasonig that involve the atom because if we do not understand the past how can we create a better future .it is said that t make an objectical abservations we should trow all of our emmotions away , and only focus on the facts .that might be true for machines or any kind of object because they do not posses emmotions .however , when we are making observations about an person or anything that have emotions this would only cause problem .imagine that aperson id being trial for fighting with another man for no apparent reason .this man should suffer some kind of punishment for doing this .however , let s say this man s wife had a car accident the afternoon of the day of the fight , and now she is in a critical state fighting for her life .the man who had never had any kind of trouble breaks apart and decides to go for a drink , but he gets drunk and starts punching the man sittin beside him .should this man be punish for doing this ? .h is a critical moment his wife might die .the point is tha people can not be judge only on facts .
