i will justify my views on three different points :i have to disagree with this statement , firstly because of the current context which is that on an average basis , people have at least one car if not two .they keep getting aware of the importance of pollution and the ecologic problems it causes , nevertheless , they go on using their car daily even for short and unsignificant distances .for example , most people will take their car to go to work or to go on vacation , which is justified , but they also will use it to go to the movies , as they could perfectly use the transportations .it is by getting more and more lazy that they end up using their car for any distance .the second reason why i disagree with this statement , is the fact that people are very much into high technology and each time more modern technology .so many different types of car are created as the years go by and it keeps on improving .so in this statement my point is that people first think about their own interest and what is best for them and certainely not about collective interest .they always want to go faster , we besides could compare this to airplanes that are built ( like the concorde ) which main purpose is again to always go faster .at last , the third reason i will mention is that the car market is in constant growth , so it is a consistant part of the economy going on , not only for the sellers , but also for the oil market .the people who rule and control this most important commerce involve way too much work and effort to have their sells decreased .they do nt have the luxury to have less costumer countries , especially when we know how rare and difficult it gets to pump oil out of its element nowadays .
