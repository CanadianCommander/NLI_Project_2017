i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .learning facts is just a metter of remembering details .when knowing a fact is required , one can always go and check himself on a book .lots of book have been written with that purpouse and there are a lot of written materials which can be useful in order to check a date or a name or whatever .the hardest thing is understanding the reasons why a certain fact has occured , the ideas that have brought to a specific event , the concept that lays under a certain episode .i think that the fondamental issue is to teach the students to become confident with this process .for example , once that a student is tought to understand and recognize the causes that have brought to the second world war , details about when where who and what can be left to several information that can be found in books .on papers and other materials it is possiple to find a lot of informations about the mere facts and every time it is needed , one can go and check .students should be rather tought how to use these informations properly .ideas and concepts provide a frame in which it is then possible to orientate themselves , in order to give sense to things which has happened in the past , which occur in the present time or which could happen in the future .we have to remenber that past can explain the present and somehow foretell the future as well .if students learn how to collect ides and concepts from facts , they are then able to give a place to mere facts .well , i can not denye that knowing facts and details do make sense itself and somehow it is also important for knowledge .however i think that is not the primary thing .first of all ideas and concepts are worthy to be understood , then details come .so , in conclusion , i would like to outline again that understanding ideas and concepts is more important then learning facts .
