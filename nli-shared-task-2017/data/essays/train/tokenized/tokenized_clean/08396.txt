the issue at hand is that whether in the next twenty years the use of cars is going to be reduced or not .i believe that the use of cars is going to be reduced .the first reason is that travelling in car is not safe .you need to concentrate on the driving .one should not get distracted while driving .where as travelling through other means like bus is much safe .the drivers are very experienced and well trained .many people know this and many are still learning that travelling by car is not safe .so i feel that cars are not safe .the other reason is that cars are less ecomomical .we need to spend a lot of money for petrol .presently there is a hike in the petrol charges and it is going to increase further .for example i go to college daily by bus .my college is around 30 km from my house and going by car costs me more .so , i feel that cars will be reduced in the future .the other reason is that we may have new inventions which may reduce accidents and be more economical .technology is improving at a much faster rate .so definetly we will have new inventions which dominate cars in many aspects .so i feel that use of cars willl be reduced in the future .every one is busy in this world .while driving a car we waste our time in driving and need to concentrate more .by travelling by other means if we can do some other work .this is going to save time which is the most valuable thing in this world .in conclusion i strongly believe that there will be fewer cars in the future .
