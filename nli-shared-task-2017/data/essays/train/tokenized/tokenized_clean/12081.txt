i agree that knowing broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than just knowing one specific subject .the first reason is that knowing just one specific subject period is over .knowing about one specific subject is important but with one subject is not enough .in ancient times many people tried for a long time with just one way and our generation s goal is to combine the knowledge of many academic subjects and improve it with uniq idea , for example , these day biomath and computer programing based on math analysis is important rather than just math and biology and computer , so combining the many academic knowledge is important .the second reason is that today we need more practical thing occured by subject .for example in math , many people think that math does nt need in real life .but math is used in computer , music , we can fine nature has a paterns of math and also it is used in health and biology , that means we have to find new away to use our knowledge with many other academic subject to improve out society and world .from above , it is important to look and know about other subject because combining the many subject s knowlege and making paratical thing by these subjects makes our world strong and improve .
