actually , i do nt think that the statement `` youg people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties  , is completely truth .personally , during the week i am always busy because of the university and the work , and during the weekend i usually enjoy with my friends and unfortunatly , this kind of life is similar to all my friends lifes and the main part of young people lifes .but i have acquitance with some boys , who really feel the needed to help other people an the communities .for example , one of them , who is just 23 years old , decided to give all his free time working in a hospital as volunteers .now they are 3 years that he enjoy working there .he spends all the weekeds , every saturday night working for the community .another boy i knew last year , left as voluntear an now he has been working for 6 months in the south america .in the village where i live , lot of people give part of their money in charity : rotary association is very popular , and there is one minority club that it is only for young people .but also lots of other associations are supported by everyone .i think that this kind of actions mean that we can support an improvement not only giving our time but also giving a financial support , and that we are not indifferent about the topic .probably , the majority of people are not used to think very often about helping their communities , and facts refelect this ; but in this last years the government has put lots of advertisements on the radio and on television , and my view is that now people are getting more confident with the problem that we have in our own communities .i think that we are paying more attention at this topic in this year than in the past .so probably young people in general have nt lot of time to helping their comunity , but they are interested in doing this , and someone of them choose helping people as the main activity of their life .
