i disagree this statement .young people should enjoy and obtain many good things from experiences .on the other hand , they should have many things to grow up .first , young people should study .when people became older , there are not opportunity to study something .to study sometimes make feel boring , but it will make use of in the future surely .further , while you are in the young age , it will be easy to understand rather than learn to in the old age .second , people enjoy a variety of things by use money .as you get older , we can earn the money and enjoyable .also , you can find own favorite hobbies as you tget older and older .also , it will be not good which young people to use money from their parents .third , after retired the job , people have alot of time to do someting .for example , people who retired the job can go overseas , go out somewhre anytime .they do not have to irritate to something or be hurry to do something .thus , older people can enjoy their time as they like .one reason that , they were hardworking , and did for children to grow up .enjoy life connects with the past life because they made effort each other .that reasons people should enjoy life after get older .in addition , peole should study and have experiences , while you are young age .that will make you to grow up and can know about the life of happiness .that reason i think older peple enjoy their life ./
