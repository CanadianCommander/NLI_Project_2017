cars will be around even in twenty years .well , the look of cars might change and the size also .they might be even more environemental friendly compared to today s models .but at the end , there will be even more cars around than today .but why ?well , there will be still people around who buy them because they are very convenient .they allow you to move from one part of the town or state to another part .you could stop by at a friend s place whenever you want .besides conveniences they offer independence and in consequence freedom to each and everybody .and freedom is a very high value for each and everybody of us .cars are also a product a lot of people strive for .are nt a lot of kids playing with toys that are cars ?a lot of kids dream about cars and are all exited about them .but these arguments that play out in favor of the individual are just one side of the coin .the other side offers economic reasons .and that is why , on a world wide scale , there will be even more cars than today .with big developing economies like china and india there are more than two billion people that strive for a better , a more independent and more westernized lifestyle .those demands have to be met either by building cars in the country or importing them from the outside .besides , the car industry has always been an important industry in any industrial evolution in the past hundred years or so .think of ford in the us , daimler benz , now daimler chrysler , in germany or toyota in japan .these companies invented back then new technologies , like the moving belt in ford s case , and even today .think of the hybrid technology toyota is using in some cars .
