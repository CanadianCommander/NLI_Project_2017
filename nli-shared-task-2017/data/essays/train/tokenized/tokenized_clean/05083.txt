i dont agree with the statement that `` there will be fewer number of cars in use than there are today  .the above may not be completely ture because of the points that are given below .to stop the usage of cars either the petroleum should get scarce and the prices should go so high that only very rich can efford to buy to use cars .and coming to technology point of view as the technology is developing the parts of cars are becomming cheaper as a result many people can afford to buy a car for their own use .so , this indicate fairly increase of the number of car than the number that persent now .also as the newer models are getting in to the market to attract people .the people who has cars already send their cars for lower price as a second hand car and go for the new one .there might be a possibility that if government want to control the pollution producd by the cars .it can increase the taxs so as to decrease the number of cars .but still the people may use the cars because the government cant lay too much of taxes .so , as far as we can see that number decreasing not likely to occur .but the growth can be predicted because of the above points .the number of car reduction cant be possible because as the population grows many people are settling well would like to have a car .also now a days many colleage students are using cars a lot so decreasing number is not really possible as the statement states .also now a days many people who use two wheelers want to buy a car next .so we can see that the population are orienting towards buying car to have luxuries life .
