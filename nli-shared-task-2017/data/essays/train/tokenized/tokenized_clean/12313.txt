i agree with this statement .people try things that they do nt know very well .the risk is a part of live and many people believe that this is the only thing to carry on live .i thing it s very sad .the quotidianity is also very important and to appreciate small things of each days is an other way to live .this statement can carry negative effects to people s life .the teenager try often things very dangerous to be appreciate by other member of a group .they take risk only to be part of something .they do nt hear what their parents tell and they do what kind of stupid things .they drive a car at high speed , for example .recently , i was watching television when i saw a girl that she had an accident with a car .she killed three guys and she only sayd : `` luckly , i was nt in our place  .incredible ! .she killed three innocent people .i think that people can try risk , but only a risk without consequences for other person .an other risk is , for example , start a business .i think that it s very difficult to create a new company , expecially today .i study business management and i understood in my university s courses that only few people can realize this thing : people that are clever , ambitious , they must understand what they are doing and this last carachteristique is the most important .maybe , a man with a family spend a lot of money to open a restaurant , but he does nt have quality to organise , to calculate problems and to solve them .he lose all for a dream too bigger for him .it s very important know what you re doing only in the small and less important thing .know the effects of own actions and imagine the actions of the others .an other risk is the bank investment .i do nt think it s a good idea and my money will stay in a security place .
