i think that number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years for two reasons , economical and enviromental reason .the economical reason is that cars are becoming more expensive and they need more gas which is actually becoming expensive too .people are expecting upcoming shortage in their money because nowadays everything is expensive and it does nt seem that there is a solution for that problem in the next two decades .and car copanies like ford ans mitsubishi did nt sell the amount they expected to in the last couple of years .so people are getting used to other types of vehicles to move around such as buses , trains , taxis subways and motorcycles or bicycles .it could be because they are more convineint to them and it s easeir to get to the place they want to go to and avoid the traffic and the rush hours .and that s exacly what s happening in dubai , where a person can stuck in traffic during the rush hour for three hours !that s why dubai s government started to build a high speed train that roll around the big city and it s expected to be done by the fall of the year 2007 .another reason is that people are getting more interested in nature again and the botanical life , so a lot of clubs and tv shows like `` the green light  are found now to encourage people to get rid of their cars and use different vehicles that wo nt make such pollution as the cars do or may be use public buses eventhogh they are polluting the atmosphere also , but they are moving anyway even if nobody uses them !so why making more pollution by using cars while we can use those buses ? !people now are convinced of this idea and they are using public transportation more .so that s why i think that number of cars will decrease by the next twenty years because cars are really expensive so people ca nt affored to buy them and they do so much damage to the nature by polluting it .
