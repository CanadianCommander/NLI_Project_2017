i believe that young people these days do not give enough time to helping their communities .in next few paragraphs , i ll provide reasons behind my belief .firstly , young people today are raised in a small family , an average size of 3 or 4 .the figure indicates that young people would have one brother or sister at most .people raised in such environment will take less consideration of others .in other words , they will turn out to be selfish and self-centred .they do not know how to help or when to help others , not to mention their communities .20 years ago , when the average size of a family were anywhere from 4 to 8 , people did not have the perception of young people not helping heir communities .young people back then were so used to live in a large group .they were naturally raised in a manner that they would appreciate their surrounding .secondly , young people nowadays are so tide up with their normal duties that they do not have to spare any time for anything else .they are living in a very competitive environment .they are constantly pushed to excel in academics , sport , and etc .whatever activities they are engaged in , they are under constant pressure to perform .natually , in order for them to compete with others , they invest lots of time and resource .i know a 8th grader who finishes school at 3 pm .after she comes home and had a bite , she goes to see a private math teacher .after math , she goes to see an english teacher .by the time she s all finished meeting her private teachers , it s already 11:30 pm .she comes back home at 12:00 am , washes up and goes to sleep .she does this everyday .kids like her just do not have any spare time for anything else .even if they do , they wo nt be able to allocate enough time .due to above two factors mentioned , young people nowadays can not give enough time to helping their communities .
