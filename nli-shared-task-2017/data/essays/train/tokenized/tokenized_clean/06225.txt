lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads can not change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative .a close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated .a main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated .the state decides about what can and ca nt be said in ads by legislating about ads and competition .that makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits : an angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company .since advertising companies are aware of that , they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for .another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status does nt hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products , but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell .how many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts ?the answer is none .and since most ads do not inform anyway , it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are .perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product s quality is in most cases subjective .for instance , some people like onion soup while others hate it .some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it .so , one s perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product .this subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive .in conclusion , the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons : state regulation , the advertisement s non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal .
