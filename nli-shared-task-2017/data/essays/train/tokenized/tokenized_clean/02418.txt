i love my car and ca nt give up using it and i do nt agree with the statement that says there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today .i have three major reasons to say that .one of them is newer types of car are being produced and the second is the transportation with car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the changes that to be done for people to transportthe first reason for not agreeing the statement is that i think rather than extinction , newer types of cars are being produced .these types include cars which works with electrical power , hydropower and in the next future i m sure there will be cars which will work with many other things .there are also plans to create cars which is flying near to surface and this will provide place for some more cars .the second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than cars which are so effective and so cheap .now the usage of cars are very huge .there are other ways of transportation for example planes .they ca nt belong to anyone in the world but car can be used by most of the people .nowadays many people have cars and in my country this number will increase as the development of the country .cars are effective for transportation for many peoplethe third reason for not agreeing this statement is that to give up using cars there should be radical changes .they should be very expensive changes , that is needed to compansate for the need of transportation of the increasing population of the world .installing a new system is required and for this system many new researches should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again .to conclude , as i stated the reasons above there will be more cars than now in twenty years .one of them is newer car types and the second one is the efficiency of cars and the expense of the changes .there is an air pollution problem because of the usage of the cars unfortunately but i believe if this problem is solved cars would be more critical and would a better place in the people s eyes .
