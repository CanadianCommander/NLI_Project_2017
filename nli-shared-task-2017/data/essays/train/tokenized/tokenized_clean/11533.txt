while many adult agree this statement , i disagree with this statement .i am a teenager , so i can see both side of viiws .it seems enjoyable for older people since they have got knowledge in their life .there are two detail examples which i think enjoyable .first of all , older people do not have to be care about anything what they do by anyone else , because it is his or her own responsibilities .for example , i have to go home at certain time , otherwise my mother worries me , and gets angry .that is stressful for me .i want to hang out late with my friends , but my mother does not allow to do it .i can not wait to be an adult , and go to downtown at night .at the time , i will appliciate my mother s kindness .second reason is that i suppose that older people can see lives more seriously than young people .i can not think the time when i marry , have children , and die , because i feel that those events will happen in an ahead time .however , older people have enough idea toward those events , for their friends had already experienced and talked to them .it would be fun to see near future with such a big events .in conclusion , older people can enjoy life more than youngre people , unless they have enough responsibilities , and knowledge .younger people can not have resposibilities for their acting .furthermore , it is difficult to enjoy life without obvious knowledge such as stories from peers .therefore , i disagree with this statement .
