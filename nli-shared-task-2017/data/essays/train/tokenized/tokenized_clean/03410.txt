have you ever benefited from the broad knowledge of many academic subjects or from the specific subjeck ?from my point of view , i believe that i would choose to have the specific knowledge of academic subject .the reasons as following .first of all , i believe that choose to gain specific knowledge of academic subject is more effective and more efficient of learning .for example , if i like foreign languages , and i want to be a person who good at languages .all i need to do is try my best to acquire the knowledge of languages academic .in that way , i can as quickly as possible to become a master of languages .in addition , i believe that choose to gain specific knowledge of academic subject is more easy to make my dream come true .inasmuch as you concentrated on the specific knowledge that you like , you would realize your dream as quick as other , for example , i want to be a english teacher , this is my dream , so i choose the department of english for my major .someone who can concentrated on what he study is easier as well as faster success than those who choose to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .to sum up , while someone want to have broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects , i would choose to the differ .therefore i would gain the knowledge of the specific subject which i liked .
