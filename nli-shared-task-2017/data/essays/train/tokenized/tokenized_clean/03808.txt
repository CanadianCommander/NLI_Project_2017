some students prefer to study only exact answers for exam ; however , some people take their time to understand the idea and concepts of topis .i prefer to understand the idea before than learn only facts .when we were children , we used to take a lot of quizes and tests at school .i remember that i used to memorize all of the answers for test for following day ; however as soon as i test finished , i forgot almost the answers .what a tragity !!!this is the main idea of support my side opposes to only memorizing facts .when people try to memorize things not knowing the idea of topics , facts do nt stay their brains longer .although if we study procedures of ideas and concepts , it makes a big difference .here is another example .either medical department or science department , students have a various type of experiments .they have oppotunities to learn how and why answers in the text book are made moreover they actually experience themselves using their actual bodies to prove answers .those experiments definitely support them to memorize so that they do nt forget answers easily .as i stated above , only knowing facts are sometims help students to pass the exam ; however , if they concern about career , they realize that it is not working .at a work environment , especially specialized field such as engnerring , workers are expected to show their knowledges and ablities straight away from school .it they only concentrated on their studying in memorizing facts , do you think they can be stated as good workers ?the answer is no .as a result , students should understand ideas and concepts before learn facts because they help them to understand topics in depth level and also there is a benefit when they think about their career .
