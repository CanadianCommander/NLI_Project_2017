i agree with that statemant .i believe that human s mind control and power .strong mind can make do something difficult from the person .successful people always have a positive mind and strong mind .it is very important to people .so , they are not afraid adventure .it makes try new things to successful people .successful people know how to can be success .for example , i heard one story .it is story who a rich person .the rich man belive that he is going to die 50 years old .and he decided to spend his all money untill his death .the rich man was ca nt stop his spend money .when his age becam 50 years old .he was still alive .but he already became poor person .suddenly the rich man became homeless .he realized about his past days .and he started again work at 50 years old .when he was 70 year old , we was rich man again .he s real life is started from 50 years old .when i heard that story , i so suprised .however , that story make me realized that successful is depend on person s mind .and who once expirenced to success know how to do well .as such reason , i support that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing wtat they already know how to do well .
