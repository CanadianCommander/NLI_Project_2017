i really have to say < i do nt know > .this is a question that i  ve discussed in the past a lot of time , particullary at the school .i think that the students often think studying like a great possibility to improve their knowledge but also their personality .to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a better man or woman in this society .an opened personal culture can give the possibility to have a lot of relationship .the problem related to this opinion is the false dream that it gives to persons like me .i do nt think that the current society can accept a man or a woman that love learning many things , but noone like specific .to find a job today it s more difficult than ever , and if you have not a specific competence you will only enlarge the big world of unemployed .now i m still studying so i ca nt speak about the job world thanks to my personal and direct experiencies , but i can see my friends and my brother s life .they have studied for a long time to be good workers , but i see this is not sufficient .the job and the society require everyday a better work .so like i usually have to do when i speak about the difference between a broad knowledge of many subjects and a specific one , i must write that today that s impossible living in a dream , where everything in your opinion is interesting .today the only possibility to create a future is to leave at home the passions and all the rest , and thinking about a specific competence that you like and that can give you the possibility to realize a part of your dream .
