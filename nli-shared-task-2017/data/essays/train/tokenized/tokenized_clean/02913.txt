when people travel to remote places they ussually think that the best way of getting to know well the place they are visiting is by being in a group led by a tour guide .this statement can be true if the person traveling is visiting the place by the first time .other way , by personal experience i think it is better to travel only with the people you know and without a tour guide .the tour guides are of great help if you do nt know the place you are visiting .in a lot of cases if you do nt travel with a tour guide you can miss a lot of places to visit because you do nt know where they are located or what is the importance of this places .it is very important to know what are you visiting and what it represents , in the case of historical sites , biuldings , or places .in my case , i like to travel alone .that way i can go wherever i want , the times i want , and stay the time i want in different places .i am an architecture s student and obviously i like to travel .the reason i like to travel is to know places of great architectural and historical importance and i love to have time to appreciate every corner of the place i m visiting .i like to see everything , to touch everything , and to feel everything .to do this i need a lot of time and i ca nt have someone telling me where to go , what to do , or even telling me false stories about some places .for example , if i have the opportunity some day to visit the versalles palace , i would not like to have someone telling me what to look or where to go .i will like to dance in the mirror hall and to smell in serenity the smeli of the garden s flowers .i think that if you know the place , or at least are familiarized with the place you are visiting , it is important to go in your own peace , and do things your own way so you can enjoy the best your travel .this does not means neccesarly that if you do things more privately you are not going to enjoy the trip .
