i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .one of the best examples that comes to mind from my personal experience is a mcdonalds burger .have you ever seen a mcdonalds commercial on tv or in a magazine ?the burgers look big , juicy and fresh .every time i see one of their ads on tv i want to run to the nearest mcdonalds to buy a big mac !the problem is that when i get there and actually buy one of their burgers i am always left very disappointed .the burger looks in no way alike to the ones you see on tv .it s smaller and it surely does nt look as fresh .the taste at the end is ok but the fact remains that their ads would never show what their real burgers look like .otherwise nobody would ever feel the urge to go out and buy one .advertisements are therefore misleading .not always but very frequently .having said this , if i were to make a commercial to try to sell one of my products , i would probably do exaclty the same thing .if everyone is doing it , i do nt want to be the only one being honest because this would negatively effect the sales of my product .the only way to solve the problem is to help the whole advertising community to be honest .we should always remember that consumers are not stupid .they can be naive at first , but not stupid .you can fool a consumer once , but the consumer will never go back to you again if he is not satisfied with your product .at the end of the day , it probably does nt pay to delibarately fool consumers .they will find out sooner or later and they will punish you .this being said , everyone is always going to try make their products seem a little more appealing to the public .this will never cease .but the consumer knows this and is aware of this .in conclusion , i will always go back to mcdonalds not because of the commercial i see on tv but because i like the taste of their big macs even though they look disgusting !
