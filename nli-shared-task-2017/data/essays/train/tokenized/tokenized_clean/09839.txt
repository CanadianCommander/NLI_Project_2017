people have different opinions on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .some people say that spacializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic .however , i oppose the idea for two reason .first , it allows students to have diverse job s opportunities .second , it is beneficial to choose the major .to begin with , it enables students to get various job s opportunies .it is known that when students in university have diverst information about other fields exept for their own major , they can get a good job easily .let me give my friend for an example .one of the my best friends has built broad knowledge for a long time at an early age .so , he got better jobs than me .that is because he can have many options on jobs .if he would not have broad knowledge of many academic , he could not get a job that he want to .on top of that , it is beneficial to select the major .today s many student in high school have a cercorn about their major in the university .that is due to the fact that they should have chosen the university .for example , my brother is in high school students .he has a worry about his major that he do in the university .so , his professor gives many advises for his major .fortunitly , he can dicide his major that is art .in conclusion , i agrees that students have broad knowledge of many academic as i mentioned avof
