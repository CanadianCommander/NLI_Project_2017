some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .but i do not agree with this statement .i will first give some reasons why one could find young people s life more enjoyable and then explain my reasons to reject the statement .one could think that the life of a young person is funnier and that young people are happier , because in general young people have a lot of freetime .they often participate in sports and arts .in addition , they go to a lot of parties meet a lot af friends .furthermore young people do not have as much responsibility as elder people have .they are not yet compelled to earn their own money and sometimes they even live in their parent s place and therefore have also less duties .but one should not forget that while having less responsibility young people have also less rights .they are not yet allowed to take all their important decisions on their own .in addition , they have lot of problems to resolve , such as passing exams , discussing with parents , making plans for their life .especially the latter might yield a lot of struggles , doubts and fears .therefore , one should not forget that also for young person life is not only fun .in my familiy i have two very good examples of people who seem to be more satisfied and happy now than they were years ago .first i have to mention my parents .in my opinion they are very satisfied to see their children succeed in life and they take advantage of the opportunities a life without small children offers to them .they are travelling much more today than they did when i was younger .thus they are also happier in their relationship .the same accounts for my grandparents .since my grandfather has retired they are travelling a great deal and i think that they are really appreciating it .therefore , i do not think that people are less happy later in life in comparison to their youth .every age has its advantages and its disadvantages .
