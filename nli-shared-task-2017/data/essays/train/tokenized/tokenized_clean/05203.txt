it is always up to the personality whether one like to keep the track of others or do something new , something which s not tried before .so according to this idea of mine , i believe that success is a reflection of personality .in my opinion success comes from production and innovation .if you do nt try something new and do the same things those have been done for years , you dont produce much .we can clearly see that from the current situations of the economies of the countries in the world .the biggest economies which produce the largest amount of national income are the ones which always produce and sell new technologic innovations .they are the one who are successfull in the world economy .because , taking risk is the most valuable input of the economic activities .trying new things always includes much more risk than the doing what they already know how to do well .as taking risk has a price , risk averse people or societies can not be successfull .if we go on from our example , far east countries which only produce already-invented-goods , can only have a little profit since they dont take the risk of trying new things .the same thing is valid in the extend of persons .in my view , doing the things what someone already know how to do well , is a thing which can be achieved by an ordinary man but not by a successfull man .because trying new things needs courage and effort to succeed .and this effort and courage must be at a level which can not be obtained by everyone since everyone can not be successfull .it is to be sucessfull to create this difference .
