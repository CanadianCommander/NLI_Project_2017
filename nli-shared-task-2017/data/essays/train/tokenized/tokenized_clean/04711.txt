today , the word success is in every mouth and seems to be the motto of the 21st century .everyone wants to be successful , in every apect that it conveys : success in business , success in love .and we may wonder it trying new things and taking risks rather than only doing what we already know drives us to the way of success .first of all , taking risks does not prevent someone from being successful as long as he has carefully measured those risks .the example of warren buffet is edifying .this business man has earned millions of dollars thanks to an excellent perception of the stock exchange market .and i think that the more successful people are also the ones that are very imaginative and can povide innovative custom-built solutions .bill gates , who started from scratch , has triggered a revolution in the sector of information technology with the creation of windows .no one had ever done what he did .he wanted to be a pioneer and he managed to be one .i think that this desire of innovation is deeply-rooted in successful people s mind : it is as if it was the goal of thir life : try or create new things .however , being a risk-taker does not bring success , if it is not combined with a sense of integrity and critical thinking .the dramatic story of vivendi universal when jean-marie messier was at the head of this company is striking .som doing what you know well is sometimes better than trying new things and taking more risks than advised .in conclusion , i think that successful people do not always try new things or take take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
