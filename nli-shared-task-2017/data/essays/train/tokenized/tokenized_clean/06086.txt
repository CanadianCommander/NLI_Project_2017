it is more importan for students to learn facts because would be better for the students to understand and it also would be more easy to remenber , i not agree with this for meny reasons .first of all , is more easy for the studens remaid the facts or the esperience that they have because they have being in .also they would never forgent that .for example , when i was in scholl i remenbered tha t i laked to go to the la boratoty to do some experiments and i felt that i never would forget that because l lived le experince .second , is more important for the studets stay in the facs because they can also show some posibles solutions about whatever problems that the would have and lear abaut this experience , third , when the studens are in facts of some event , it is more exacted for then because they are living the experience .moreover , the studets would be more interested in the subject that they are coursing .also they would be better and work successfully .in conclusion , for all these reasons i agree whit is more important for the students lear facts than learn abao the ideas and conceps .
