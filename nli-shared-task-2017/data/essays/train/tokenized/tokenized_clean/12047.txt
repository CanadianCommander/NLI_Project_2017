well i think it s very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do .the first quesiton is , what are old people , and what are young people ?it mainly depends on the person .let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and eldery people are about 60 years old .in this case , young people have other interests than eldery people have .for example , young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music , whereas eldery people are enjoing a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the backround .but i have to mention , that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music .for example the generation who grows up with rollingstonse or acdc still goes to their concerts .the only difference is , that young people normaly are in better shape then eldery people are .the older you are the more problems your are getting with your physical condition .for example , young people can make more sports .eldery people have to care more about themselve .maybe young people are often more flexibel but this is also a stereotype .after my opinion this is not very important to enjoy life .usually , eldery people can do the same things like younger people can do if they are carefully .they even have one important advantage , because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have .if they have enough money , they can fly or travel to each place where they want to , whereas the younger ones have to go to school , to university or to work .the young people either have nt enough money to do things or they have nt enough time .like i have written at the beginning of this text , how you enjoy life depends on your pesonaltiy and on your flexability .if you stay in life and if you stil have fun , the age is nt so importan for enjoing life .
