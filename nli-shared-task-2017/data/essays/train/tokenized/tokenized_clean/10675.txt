i totally agree with this topic statement .being able to succeid in life is not easy .althought everybody wish to succeid just a few can really do so .succeid is an everyday fight .i think that taking risks allow people to improve their situation .moreover trying new things bring a lot of knowledge .first , by taking risks people can change their life in order to improve it .for instance , someone who is living in a poor country and who does not earn enought money to be able to eat needs to take risks .if he wants to be able to live in better conditions he should for example try to emigrate in a richer country .in my point of view , this is a tremendous risk ; however , it is primordial one in order to improve his finacial situation .he will afterward most likely be proud of himself .therefore his life would undoubtetly be a success !second , i believe that by trying new things someone can definitively have the chance to succeid .indeed , trying new things means also get interested in new field .for instance a university student who takes ( tries ) different courses will at the end of his education have a lot of strong knowledge .this knowledge will be a strong basis for his futur profesional life .i am convinced that someone whom is bright and excellent a school will most likely succeid in his life .he will find a stumulating job that will bring him joy as well as money in order to live in good conditions .in conclusion , people should take risks and try new things each day .those risks will bring them on the top and will make them successful people .furthermore this sucess will make them happy .however i acknowledge that taking risks and trying new things are not always easy thing to do but i am confident that its important to do them .
