the topic `` young people do not give enough time to help their communities  is a very controversial one .on one hand it seems to be true relating to the other activities of young people .but on the other hand it proposes a negation considering many communities where young people itself are the key workers .i would go by the direction that young people do nt have enough time helping the communities .firstly , a young mind wants to enjoy and spend his teenage with pleasure so that he can cherish his memories when he is old .infact he goes by the policy that life is short and enjoy it to the maximum .for example consider a young boy who is more intersted in playing rather than helping his community .secondly , i feel that young minds are already being stressed under a process named studying .he has homework and other activities called exams , papers for which he has to spend enough amount of time to improve his career and also his nation as children are the future building blocks of every country .further he can improve on his field and can also put undivided attention on his studies turning out to be a great scientist or professionalist .if he devotes time for helping communities , his precious time will be lost as time and tide wait for none .he can not achieve his aim or goal set for himself .another point which supports my arguement is young children do not do not have enough interest to help and support the community .the young children nowadays are more interested in enjoying going to night clubs , watching films and other activities which are hinderence in helping their communities as interest or desire drives a person rather than duities .from the above points , i would conclude saying that young children have many other activities and interests rather than helping their communities .
