i do not aggre with the statement .it is obvious that youngsters and older people have different ways to spend their time , but it has to do more with generation matters than with their capacity of doing enjoyable things .i know it is a common belief that during the youth one has a wider range of activities to enjoy , but a more carefully view of the facts might change this position .there are two main factors that could support my point .in first place , an important factor is the experience .the experience gives a person the capacity of making better decisions but also gives one a better perspective of life .both things help older people to enjoy some events or things which young people do not .secondly , older people usually can be benefited from resources they have save during their youth .thus , the avaliability of greater resources among older people can also contradict the idea that young people enjoy life more than those older ones .commonly , young people have to spend a lot of time generating those resources .however , it has to be said that young people have some other advantages over older people regarding the capacity of enjoy some activities .the main advantage is naturally their energy and - usually - health .young people have more energy and are usually healthier .for that reason they can enjoy better things involving physical activity .the main example of this is sexuality , but there are a lot of other examples like sports .in balance .i think both youngters and older people have many things to enjoy .and there is no reason to think one of those groups is more able to enjoy life .
