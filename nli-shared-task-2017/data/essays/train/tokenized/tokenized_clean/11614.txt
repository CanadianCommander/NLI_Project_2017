i strongly agree that young people thesedays do not give enough time to help their communities .there are three main reasons that illustrate this trend .first and foremost , the number and the size of the community itself has dimminished .in the modern society , mobility of the people has increased and the oppotunities of the transfer because of changing job have rapidry increased .therefore , the community is dimminishing so that there are few oppotunities for young people tto attend helping their communities .in adittion , young people are becoming more and more independent of their communities .highly developed transportaions or telecommunications reduced the neccecity of the community .the dependence on the community increase the motive to contribute to the community .therefore , the less young people depend on their communities , the less they want to help their communities .last but not least , developing social welfare are taking place of the help of young people in the community .some decades ago , to help the elderly or the poor in each community , the help of young and tough people was vital .however , in the modern society , to care for the elderly or the poor is the domain of the goverment .therefore , the community itself does nt need young people s help .in conclusion , the role of young people in the communities has been little value and the role of the communitied for young people has , either .therefore , not only the motive of young people to help their communities has be less , but also the opptunities to do so has also been reduced .what to be blamed is not only young people .
