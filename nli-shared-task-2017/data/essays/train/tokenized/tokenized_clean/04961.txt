cars which are the most typical transportations are widely used by the people all over the world .but lately people found that cars also should responsible for the serious air pollutions .so , according to this reason , many people requires the government to restrict the number of the cars and they believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .i do nt quite agree with this statement for following reasons .though too many cars will pollute the air , it is a convenient way to travel by car .and this thought will not change for only a couple of scores .there may be many kind of transportations , such as bus , subways , planes , ships and so on , but not can be compared as cars .take me for an example , if i want to go to a supermarket which is 4 miles away from my home , what transport would i first consister ?of cause the car !i do nt want to waste my time to wait for a bus , it is unable to take plane or ship and the subway station is far away from my house .in conclution , unless we invent another kind of transportation , cars wil still become the best transportaion in decadesthe biggest problem of the car , everyone can tell , is the waste air and smoke .cars use gasline as their power and release harmful gases which pollute the air .gasline may be run out and air should never be polluted .however , this problem can be solved .recently , many car builders have invent new cars that use solar power rather than gasline .this is sure to help protect our natural resources and our environment .the overcrowed roads may be the second biggest problem .many of people think that we must solve it , otherwise we will hard to move efficiently .but this problem is due to the over-growing population , it s not the cars  fault .if the population decreases , this problem will not exsit .so this is not the excuse not using the car .all in all , we must find a positive way to solve the problem .using the solar power and solve the road problem , the car will still be useful and helpful .as a result , the car will not decrease in twenty years .
