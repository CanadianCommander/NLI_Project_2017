i disagree with the statement because i do nt think that enjoying life has anything to do with age .i believe there are more issues that have to be take into consideration in order to establish whether a person at any particular age does or does not enjoy life .health , for instance , is crucial for happiness and therefore can be determinant for enjoying or not enjoying life .one s character and emotional stability are also important factors .i m sure there are old people that suffer from bad health and are not able to enjoy life fully , but this could also be the case of a teenager suffering from leuchemia and feeling miserable .he is young but not necessarily enjoys life .on the other hand , there must be people that being old , have the blessing of having the best health and therefore enjoy life more than troubled teenagers struggling with their banalities .other factors can infuence the conception of self-hapiness of a person like family , social or cultural class , opportunities , income level , etc .all these factors impact people of all ages .i also think that it is a matter of attitude .while there are outer factors that influence the way we enjoy life or feel happy , it is what everyone makes out of the siuations what at the end of the day determines their conception of happiness .the way we deal with problems and our ability to solve them , the very thought of ourselves as free living beings and the attitude we have towards our enviroment , are factors that will make the people that sorround us decide whether we are enjoying life or not .the statement is misleading beacise it inferrs that young people can do more things than old people and can therefore enjoy life more .
