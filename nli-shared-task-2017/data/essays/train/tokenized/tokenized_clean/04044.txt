in now a day sociaty , academic is more and more important , everywhere is looking for a high level academic school or college , but if we enter a better academic institude , are we going to be genios or having more ability for sure ?the main function of school and college is to prepared men , but they ca nt make one s decision , for example , a man is going to studied in a high academic college but he does nt like to study , all he wants is to meet people and have a good time .these  decision  is from his only purpose and not by the college .deciding which academic subjects to pick is depending on every single person .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is reasonably , how could a man known everything little by little but when he is in front of a very specific problem , what is he going to do ?for example , an high school teacher is in her house , what is she going to do if suddenly her computer does nt work and she need to work on her job ?maybe she know how to fix it , but if not ?she is just only a high school student .in the other hand , if specialize in one specific subject , there are were some unespecific things that one man does nt know its like he ca nt resolve a simply problem .every subject has they own advetage or disadvatage one subject is depended on another , so i will agree with borad knowledge
