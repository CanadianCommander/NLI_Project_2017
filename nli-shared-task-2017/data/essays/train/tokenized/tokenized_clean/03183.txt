i partially agree with the statement .the human race is full of diversity & complexity , especially the human mind `` no two people think alike  & this is a major cause of conflict between individuals in everyday life .thinking about the proverb :`` successful people dont do different things , they do things differently  .being able to try new things , without pondering over the risk of failure , is indeed courageous , infact an innovation might seem precarious , but being able to work on it & trying to prove it to others , being able pursue people to accept it , is in itself a painstaking & tedious job .it would definitely consume a lot of time , because , being able to convince others , when everyone thinks differently , is in itself a cumbersome task .yes , one might be successful in the long run , because no effort goes wasted , but one needs to have a lot of patience & perseverance .for example : trying to introduce a new drug in to the pharmaceutical industry is possible for a very diligent & patient person who is willing to carry out research , animal studies , clinical trials , approval from the fda , then finally introduce the drug in the market , this can take up to several long years .in the mean time several small industries might manufacture existing drugs after their patents expire , which is quicker , entails less risk , and ofcourse surity of the product sale , low cost .doing only what one already knows is definitely easier .doing things `` differently  might involve an enterpreneur who comes up with an extremely lucrative marketing strategy , but about marketing the same products , which were not doing too well initially , but suddenly have started doing great .here the person is very successful by not doing something different , but doing things `` differently  .success is not limited to few thoughts & strategies , but is a combination of various constructive thoughts & efforts , put forward by an individual or various individuals , to make things work in a constructive & productive way .the definition of a successful person might not always be the one who is willing to try new things & take risks , but may also be the one who thinks of doing things he already knows in a more `` innovative way  & still be a huge success , for example : donald trump , who ventured in to real estate business , which is not something new , but not everyone who ventures in to real estate goes even close to donald trump , because `` he does things differently  .ofcourse , the who knows how to take a `` calculated risk  by making sure he doesnt suffer if the risk doesnt work in his favour , can definitely be successful .so i partially agree with the above mentioned statement .
