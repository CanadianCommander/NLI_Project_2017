the world in which we are living today is shrinking .with the advent of computers and internet , it is possible to stay back at home and work .daily we are flooded with so much information .today , undoubtedly , information is the key to success .in this new environment , it is important that one should possess variety of information .lots of new opportunities are created because of these radical changes .however , i believe that though variety in learning is important , specialization in one subject is critical for the survival .with the increasing competition , maintaining the superiority and growth potential in one s profession is becoming increasing difficult .if you are not the best then somebody who is , will definitely replace you .it is particularly important in today s scenario .there is a lot of change happenning around us .sometimes good and sometimes bad .consider an example of recession in the u.s it industry in the year 2001 .lots of software professionals were fired and given pink slips in those days .however , those who had sound knowledge and degree behind them managed to stay back in business .consider an example of a doctor .if someboby is suffering from a heart problem and needs an heart transplant , he will definitely prefer a cardiac surgeon and not an m.b.b.s who has the knowledge about all medical problems .in short , some professions strictly need super specialized knowledge to be successful .if we are talking about primary education and even undergraduate studies , learning many subjects is of prime importance .however , when we taught about graduate studies and work environment , it is extremely important to have specialized knowledge .i will summarize by repeating that a broad knowledge base is of no use unless we use it in acquiring specialization in one specific subject .
