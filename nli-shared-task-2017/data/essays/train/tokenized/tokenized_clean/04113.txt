i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is quite easier for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .hypothetically speaking , students learn some theory or phenomenon in a certain academic field and they have to take a test about it .here is a student who just memorize the facts which a teacher explained in the classroom .this student does not try to understand the main ideas and concepts about it at all , but believes that he or she knows everything that the teacher explained for test .the other student tries to understand the main ideas and concepts for the test , but he or she does not memorize the whole note .as for the result of the test , the first student and second one can have the same grade or the first student who memorizes the facts can have a higher grade than the other ; i think it depends on the questions which the teacher askes for the test .no matter what grade two students get for the test .no matter who gets higher grade .the important matter is that the first student who learns facts can not apply what he or she learns for other relevant academic fields and also when the student goes to a college for the advanced education , he or she will have trouble with having own thoughts and ideas related with what he or she learns .it is the reason that the student does not know how to understand the main ideas and concepts and also does not know how to think about them to make them as own thoughts and ideas .the student can eat the apple when someone gives to him directly , but if it is not , he or she can not eat it because he or she does not know how to pick .on the other hand , the other student who keeps studying as trying to understand ideas and concepts can develop the concepts that he or she learned before while studying at college because he or she knows how to make the ideas and concepts as own and how to think and apply them for the further or relevant academic fields .this student knows how to pick up the apple now , so he or she does not need to wait for someone who gives .whenever he or she wants to eat it , the student take the apple from the tree and eat it .consequently , when students really want to learn something for their own , they have to understand ideas and concepts first .
