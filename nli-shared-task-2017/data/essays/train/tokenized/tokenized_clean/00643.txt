i agree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and support the following belief of mine with the following views .firstly , being young means full of energy and the biggest advantage is physiological .a young person is fit and healthy both .this makes him to be open to new things , he experiments , innovates and takes risks which brings achievement and sense of accomplishment .the high amount of adreanaline helps him to work hard and enjoy harder .secondly , at younger age you have less resposibilities .you dont have children to bother about , you need not to worry about your pensions , provident funds and all that , all you bothered about is the present .you have a long way to go and suspense about the future keeps you on front foot .thirdly , at younger age you are on the verge to build new relations , you love rain , you love dancing in it , you experince the first touch and get to introduce yourself to a new sensation called love , it makes your world colourful , you wait for night to pass on and wait for dusk to get a gilmpse of someone you love .you marry and enjoy the life with your partner , you became social , you became caring and bothered about another person .all this makes life more colourful .and when time passes by and you notice physiological changes within making you weak , you start worrying about a lot of thing to do before you say goodbye .you fear the ultimate truth ie death approachinhg towards you with a lot of thing which are still pending .you feel either you are running out of time or you have nothing to do and just wait for the judgement day .you are worried about your children and their future .thus , at some time at the later stage you feel that life was very joyful when you were young therefore i think that young people enjoy life more that old people do .
