perception is reality .this sentence is the premise that makes marketing one of the most profitable industries on our days .as we live in a world in which the media controls millions and millions of minds , the more you are advertised the more you can influence the conduct of the market .in the early 1990 s , parallel to the boom of mass media , the introduction of the internet and the satellite tv companies around the world started to spend constantly more and more money on marketing .examples of how people s mind can be controlled can be shown in almost all areas of production , from medicine to food industry , from clothing to transportation .i am a medical doctor involved in the cosmetic industry .years ago , surgical procedures such as liposuction or breast augmentation were only reserved to a very limited section of the population .this procedures involve several risks such as general anesthesia , prolongued recovery times , allergic reactions and even stroke or death .as these procedures started to being advertise in tv shows broadcasted all around the world , such as dr. 90210 or extreme make over , the number of patients demanding these type of procedures rised globally in a geometrical or even exponential way .paradoxically , the risk factors continue to be the same , but as the procedures are more and more advertised , people often belive that the risks have been diminished .same situation happens with food .aspartame is the chemical component of nutrasweet , an artificial sweetener that has modified the whole food industry .several medical studies were conducted years ago evaluating the safety of the high consumption of aspartame ; the results were shocking .rats exposed to this chemical compound suffered from alzheimer disease and several types of tumors ; however , marketing is so powerful that it could overcome the negative campaign .other examples can be offered and added to the list , but certainly they follow the same pattern .our mind is driven by certain impulses that we ca nt control , and the more times we get stimulated by something the more we get involved .sad , but this is how it works .
