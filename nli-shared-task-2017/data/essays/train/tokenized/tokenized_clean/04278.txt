some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .other people disagree with the statement .personally , i think that young people do enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .young people have more strength , hope , and friends .first of all , young people have more physical strength than older people do .for example , young people can go swimming in summer , and go skiing in winter .however , older people , such as people around eighty , can not swim or ski anymore due to their physical strength .especially , sports like skiing are dangerous to them .if they fall off , they might break their bones since they are not strong enough as they used to be .furthermore , young people can travel around and walk whole day long .when young people go to other countries to travel , they can go to many places and enjoy the place as much as possible ; however , older people easily get tired and can not move around as young people do .they spend their time in hotel which is not very exciting .in addition to having physical strength , young people have hope and dream toward their future .for instance , young people study hard and try their best in order to achieve their dreams .even though they face some difficulties , they do not give up .young people have bright futures ; therefore , they put their effort into everything to create and change their futures .on the other hand , older people can not change their futures that much anymore .they get up and eat and go to bed again .their daily life cycle would not change anymore .therefore , i think their life is much more boring than young people s .lastly , young people have more chances to get to know many people , and they can make many friends who surely make their lives more exciting .for example , when they go to school , there are many classmates , and when they go to company , there are many co-workers .all the people they meet definitely have some influence on them .when they have something happy , they can share their happiness to other people .furthermore , when they have some difficulty with anything , people around them might be able to help them .young people learn important things from people around them as they grow up .it is clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do .they know how to entertain themselves by having more strength .they know how to create better lives with hope by working hard .they are influenced and inspired by many friends and people around them .
