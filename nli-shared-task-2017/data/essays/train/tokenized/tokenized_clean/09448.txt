adults and young people enjoy life .adults watch their children grow , and watching them succeed every step while growing up , walking through harsh moments and surviving , such as their kid s first smile , first birthday , first day of school , first sport match victory brings joy and happiness to the adult .young people enjoy life too , mostly by playing and trying out new things .an adult would have gone through many stages in his life , but that doesnt mean he still cant enjoy his time .what interests adults might differ from what interests young people .young people are still growing up and having fun and doing activities and setting goals and ambitions would bring them joy .if a teenage boy , joins the school s soccer team with a goal to win the championship against all other schools , and his goal gets achieved , he ll be very proud and happy .his parents , would also feel the same joy , watching their child win .when an adult decides to have children , he would most likely be committed into giving that child all the love and affection he has .`` young people enjoy life more than older people do .i strongly disagree with that statement .young people would have alot of fun moments that they cherish and later on becomes a happy memory to be remembered , but who would have more memories ?an adult or a young boy or girl ?adults know more than young people , and know how to deal with situations in a more serious and safer way .while young people have not encountered such a problem , they would feel stressed and scared , and would eventually seek advice from the adults .when a boy goes to his dad and asks for advice when he s in trouble , then his father comforts him and ensures him everything will be alright after telling him what he has to do .the father would notice that his child is growing up , and is becoming more mature which fills his heart with joy and happiness .an adult with children would want the best for them , and he d be willing to do the impossible to ensure that his child has the best care and support he can offer .experience is the main key that brings joy in life , and adults would have more of that than young people .simple things would bring joy to an adult , a simple smile his child gives him is enough to keep him happy .while , young people wanna experience new things such as going out with their friends , playing games , travel to new places is what makes them enjoy life the most , and that doesnt occur everyday .but , an adult that watches his children grow more and more each day is what makes him enjoy life .
