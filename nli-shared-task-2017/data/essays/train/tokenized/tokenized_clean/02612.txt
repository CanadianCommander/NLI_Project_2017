i disagree with the given statement .in my opinion , young people do their best to help their community and society .i can say this with conviction because i myself have done my best to help society .my grandmother runs a primary school for children with limited means .since i was about ten years old , i have been going to this school every summer to do voluteer work .i have interacted with the children , played games like soccer and cricket with them , taught them extra-curricular activities like dance and painting and even taught the children younger to me academic subjects like math sometimes .it is a great feeling to be able to give to somone something so important - education .some of the children there became my friends and i still do talk to them .some of them are in high school now .my brother too has been doing his bit for the society .he goes to old age homes .he interacts with the old people there and reads stories to them .they are lonely and need someone to talk to .they feel extremely touched when young children like my brother take out time to come and meet them .my brother too loves to go and spend time with them .many of my friends are into community service as well .a very good friend of mine , julia , works closely with mentally challenged patients .she is also an active volunteer for a school with mentally challenged students .so , in my opinion , it will not be entirely correct to say that young people do not take out enough time to help their communities .i do agree that there are exceptions this , that there are people who do not wish to indulge in community service .however , they are mere exceptions .
