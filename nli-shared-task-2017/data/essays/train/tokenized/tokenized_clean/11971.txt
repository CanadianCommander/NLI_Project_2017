many books may have been written about the subject : `` 3 keys to success  , `` 10 easy steps to to reach the top  .there might probably be even a `` comple idiot s guide to success  .but there is a thought that always comes to my mind regarding to life stories that achieved success .those people certainly tried new things and took risks rather than sticking to routine .i can not but agree with the premise : innovators and risk-takers are the stuff for success .some people argue that once you find out what you are good at , you should stick to it .these strategy suggests that this conservative , risk avoiding behaviour , assures some kind of success while avoiding any chance to fail .but even people who enter this routine of doing always the same suffer failure sometimes .i must agree that i ca nt imagine einstein suddenly trying to succeed in football .yes , he should remain in the science field .but , on the other hand , his unquenchable desire for knowledge moved him forward in his research .his quest for the new , made him one of the famoust scientist there will ever be .on the other side , holding a totally different position , are restless people who are constantly trying new things and risking everything to be singled out off mediocrity .people who take high risks , are focused on big gains .for example columbus undertook a risky trip , but his name remains written in every history book .the wrights brothers went after a dream which was deemed impossible in their time .these are the people from which we can say they are outstanding .while i do nt think we should go around doing crazy stuff , we should always try to escape routine .repeating ourselves too much , is like slow death .it never ends in success .
