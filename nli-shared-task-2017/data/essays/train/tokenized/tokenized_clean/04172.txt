whenever i think of successful men , these two persons always hang around my mind , thomas eddison and christopher columbus .even though they lived in quite different era , they always get me thining about the issue that what makes them such a successful and great persons thoughout the world and in the history ?evidently , i believe that trying new things and taking risks are the main factors of that .this is reason why i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .if columbus sticked at operating his small ships along the local coast , it goes without saying that he could never show the new land to us .when everybody was satisfied at their daily lives , he wanted new thing with new vision persuing new wish and hope .as we can see , his wish , keeping pluging away to seek `` new things  was so anxious that he could overcome many hassles and obstacles during the voyage .although he met so many dangers , such as diseases , protests of other crews and laughing and critics by the public , he succeeded in casting same vision and hope with him to others and opponents and also convinced them to try new things along with him .and how risky was eddison s activities ?he seemed even silly and insain to others at that time .sometimes he acted the man who did nt know what is the risk and danger as if he was a callow youth and children .all for his wishes to try new things !i believe that he probably knew about the risk in advance when he came close to explode the train for the experiments .but he was brave , check that , knew that it was needed and essectial for the success which he really and anxiously wanted .other s critics are also another risk for man who wants success .eddison was not foolish enough not to know the laughing when he took egges for observing the hatchings .but as everybody knows , he did .i thinks that if they wanted to do what they already know how to do well , eddison would become a usual clerks at the grocery store and columbus should be
