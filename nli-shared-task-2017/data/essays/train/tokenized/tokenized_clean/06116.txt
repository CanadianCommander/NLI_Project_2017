i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people are more challenging , more active , and more socialized .young people lived shorter time of life than older people .that means , young people have not learned as many as lessons or experinced more .from not knowing what consequences are going to come , young people challenge more than older people .by challenging new things young people can enjoy more and experience .and from experiencing and learning they become older people .having a younger body can help enjoy life .young people have more physical strenght than older people .as you get older people get less active .especially when you get old , many parts of body does not work as before .on the otherhand , youn people has enough energy .they can go sky diving , run all day , or even dance all night .to do lots of things people need strength .physical strength can be a big part if enjoying the life .young people are very socialized .young people go out at public than older people .they meet more people and like to be outdoors .by meeting diversity of people they learn and get to enjoy people and life .young people experience more and enjoy life than older people .young people have a lot of energy and desire to do more things to enjoy life .but older people have enjoyed life when they were the young people .everyone starts young and gets old .so everyone enjoys life .
