idears and facts can be thought two different parts of a song .idears like the melody of a song and the facts like the lyrics of the song .both of them are important , however , if we change the lyrics of a song , it seems it still a song and just with different meaning , but if we change the melody of the song , sometimes , it may not be a song or it is already another song .compareing with these tow different parts , i agree that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , i believe idears and concepts of knowledge is the main core as the most important part during our learn .there are millions and millions facts of each subject , and it is impossible for us if we want to get ench specific aspact of the facts , even though we spend our whole college life to learn them .so the best way of learning knowlege is to get the main idear or concepts in the first step , and then pick up some relative facts to help us understatn it and empersize it .on the other hand , there is no nesseary to learn all the facts but we must to get the ideas and concepts , even when we do the extra-activities .in the extra-activities that we orgainazed in college , we usually need to prepare a lot of details things in oder to keep it going as we expected .but , there are still more or less new problems emerge during the activities .if we only focus on the facts that we learned or we prepared , we will never ever find the right way to solve it immedietly .however , if we have a well-understanding of main idear on this compain , we will do everythings quikly and in the right derection .that is why i think getting the main idear is more important than learning facts .
