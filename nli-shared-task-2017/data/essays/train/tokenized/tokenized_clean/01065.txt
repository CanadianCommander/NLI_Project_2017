some peole like to try new things and make successe ; while others enjoy doing the same tasks or matters they already know .as far as i am concerned , i am the person who hate doing repeated things .as a result , i agree successful people experience new matters and take risks .following are the reasons .first of all , some people like me like to enjoy the fresh things .these people will cultivate their interests during the new things , and they will love and immerse themselves to new things .take me for example , i major in the industrial and information management department .in this field , we all have to study the operation management subject .however , i thought it was very boring after two years studying them .i turned to related subject , which called logistics .i had not studied before , but i developed my interest in this subject and now i love the subject very much .in the second place , some people like to take risks and make fortunes .imaging that you have some money on hand .will you deposit your on-hand money or you will invest them to get the expected reward and take some risks .the interest rate in bank now is very low ; therefore , if we choose save our money into the bank , we can not get the same amount as the investment does .now , what do you think ?however , there are still some successful people through doing what they already know .i am of the opinion that these people have experienced many new things and own vast knowledge in their mind .when they face some situations , the vast knowledge is the basis for decision process .these successful people easily know how to transform the knowledge into the real cases .that is to say , they are not doing the same things ; rather , they utilize the basic concepts in their mind to solve many diverse situatations and make a success in the long run .due to the mention above , i am of the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks .
