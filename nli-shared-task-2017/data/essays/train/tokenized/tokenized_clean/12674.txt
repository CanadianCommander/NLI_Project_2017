most advertiments that companies made for themselves look really good and perfect conducts for every consumers .however , consumers have experienced that conducts , they always made bad compliments about their conducts that they had already used because of too much expectations about conducts .however , i agree the reason that why most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are to consumers .there are two reasons .the first reason of most advertisements emphasize much better than they really are is appealing to consumers .if companies want to appeal to their consumers , they have to make a kind of ` fantasy  to them about their products .if they do nt do that and they say about the truth , that could nt appeal their consumers  market at all .in addition , if consumers heard just truth , they would think about their product as just normal other things .then , it can be same things like other products .there are no differences .therefore , for using some fantasy about their products , it would be a good way to appeal their consumers and markets .the second reason of most advertisements look better than they really are is about their goal .naturally the most important thing in each companies is about their goal that sell their products as much as possible .when the companies make some advertisements , they have to think a new and creative way to sell .on advertisements , most companies have to show only good side about their products to consumers .therefore , consumers might think that companies make fun of their consumer .however , that is not true .in conclusion , it is the only way to appeal and sell their products to consumers for showing much better things than they are .when consumers are seeing some commercials and they think  wow , that is going to be really useful !i want to have it !.i think that the conduct is ready to be sold .that commercial is really good .the last my thinking about commercial is that commercial is made for ` cheating  to consumers .
