generaly , young people think that they know how to enjoy life and to have fun .they think that there are more ways to have fun when you are young than when you are older because most of the time when your are young you dont have a lot of responsabilities and you have more time to think about yourself because you dont have a family and so on . ..so young people are free to go out at night , to travel , to sleep late in the morning ( and sometimes even in the afternoon ) because they wont have to wake up on sunday morning to take care of the children .they dont have to save money for the projects of the family and they can waste all their money for themselves .but youth is not eternal and one day they will have to think about the future .and when the time will come for them to grow up and have a different way of life with a family and responsabilities they may realise that they were wrong , and that they are still enjoying life and having fun but in a diffrent way .they will enjoy the moments they will spend with their family and they will be proud of their new houses , cars . ..they will be able to enjoy familial holidays and of course in their jobs they will have improved and get more income to be able to have new projects .but when all this is over ?it is not the end at all , elderly people have an important advantage for enjoying life : experience .they know more places , more people and more ways to have fun than anybody else .actually , i think that you dont have to be young to enjoy life .you can enjoy life at any age .in different ways , it is up to you , and it depends on your character and your personnality .
