fewer cars in twenty years ?do you really think there will be fewer cars in a time of a raising economy ?i do nt think so for 3 reasons .firstly , the world has 60 billion peoples and it wo nt stop raise .the number of people all over the world will increase .the economy will also increase .my personal infer is that more people need more cars , and the graphs of the world population supporting my opinion .secondly , people have to be more flexible , it s a major point in every job .in todays jobs for example you have to travel from berlin to munich daily .you do nt would like to fly because it s to expensive , so you have to drive .in my mind there is a big importance in beeing flexible , therefore you need to have a car .if you do nt have one you could easily loose your job .do you like loose your job ?thirdly , the car manufacturer are aiming to sell more cars as they are doing right now .that s the goal of every entrepreneur .they are doing everything to increase there cars .they will design and manufacture new models .perhaps a new brand will start up .they are reaching new potential customers in third world countrys .so for example lancia did , they produced very cheap cars for poor people .all this leads into a increaing number of cars .in conclusion , i say that it s nearly impossible to decrease the amount of cars .there is only one big problem , the oil ressources , but we have very good scholars to invent new alternative mobiles without the need of oil .i am very excited how the future is going on .
