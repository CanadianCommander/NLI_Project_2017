in life everyone tries to be sucessful and is working hard so their dreams will come true .however , i believe that the key to success is to have innovative ideas and not to be afraid for new things .first , your enviromment is changing around you all the time , so it s always important to keep up with it and be informed about the changes in it .however to be successful you even have to be better than the others and put more efford into it .this means that you have to work harder and sometimes try new methods to work through something .second , i believe that it s important to trust his own skills and believe in his work even if they are risky or different from the normal way .these ways make your work special and put even more work into it .new ideas or ways can improve your work from other and lead to success .for example a new software or a new technique can effect the whole industrie .third , if you only do what you already can do there is no moving forward and you stuck somewhere .this means that other people with the same knowledge can replace you or can turn your work into something unimportant by having an even better idea .for example a product nobody wants to buz because someone else s product has an even better effect although success comes with a lot of hard work and with being creative and innovative , success can open a lot of different doors like money , self-conficence or happiness .so in conclusion i think it s important to be risky and able to try new things to reach his dreams and be successful .in fact everyone what s to be so .
