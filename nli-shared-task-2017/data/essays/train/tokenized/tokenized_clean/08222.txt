no , i do nt agree completely with the statement that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i have many reasons that support my argument .firstly , there is no immediate reason why people are going to do away with cars in another twenty years .car is one of the most commonly used automobile these days , humans use it for many of their daily purposes and a whole industry thrives on this .and car is a symbol of status in some of the developing countries even today .and the way technology is progressing by leaps and bounds , one can only imagine the various levels of comforts and advantages a car provides in contrast to any other vehicle .but , as any study on the problems plaguing the road transport would rightly indicate , cars are creating some problems that may prompt anyone to suggest their ` extinction  .there might be several reasons for the author to give this statement , some positive and the rest indicating the ill effects of usage of car .one reason that might have prompted the author to state that the fate of cars in use is going to sealed , in the next twenty years , is that nowadays we are trying to find alternate means of road transport , because of various problems a car poses today .definitely , a huge amount of research is going on this direction , to find better and better means of transport , that will subside or eliminate the use of cars and their corrent problems .but noone would disagree that at the same time , lots of efforts are going on to address the current problems cars are posing , and thus making car a better vehicle .coming to the problems cars are posing these days , the first thing that evinces is the pollution caused .automobiles cause a lot of pollution and cars do form a lion s share of this .but , research is giving sufficient attention to this , alternate ways to avoid the use of petrol and deisel as the fuel for cars and other automobiles , are being studied and experimented .we already have some cars running on the roads using solar energy or biodiesel for fuel , which though are in their infant stages , provide attractive prospects for cars in the future .moreover , these alternatives may , who knows , eventually make the car a better vehicle than what it is at present .another reason is possibly the traffic problems posed by the increasing cars .governments are encouraging people to let their cars rest in the garrages , atleast on some days of a week , so that both pollution and traffic problems can be attenuated .but even these problems plague the whole of automobile industry , and the only way to control this is by having proper strategy for all the automobile , not cars alone .further , an attempt to amelirate the current situtation of road traffic should work towars making the roadways more effective as a whole by better management and other means .just trying to avoid the usage of cars wo nt do .thus , from some of the plausible reasons put forward in the above argument , it can be said that cars are not going anywhere in the next twenty years , but they are going to have the same dominant role they are playing now in the road transport .further , i suggest that if the tone with which the author has given this statement would have helped much more in the analysis .
