i agree that successful people are not only doing what they already know how to do well but try new things and take risks .for example , about five hundred years ago , korean naval general yi was continue win consist japan naval army .but he does nt confuse it and forecasted more bigger war after a few years .so he made many new ships and training his army .therefore , after a few years he made so biggest win from japan .second example is my mother .she already gave many wealth and became well-known people in society .but in 1998 , korea met imf .as my mother taked risk , she felt to leck education level herself .in fact , she was graduated elementary school only .so she started middle school course when she was 45 years old .lastly , graduated middle school , high school , and university .as i am a person who see my mother most nearby , i strongly confuse it .in my opinion , when successful people meet difficult thing , they always challenge new thing .
