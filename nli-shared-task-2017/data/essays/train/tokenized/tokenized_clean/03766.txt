is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific suject they choose ?it is not so easy to say which is more desirable .often it seems to be dependent on the characteristics of the person .but i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge concerning many areas than to specialize in one specific subject for the following two reasons : firstly no one can reach the full knowledge of every aspect , secondly it is more profitable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result .at first , no one grasp the entire knowledge of every subject .what is easy to scientists may not be easy to sociologists .also what is natural to sociologists may not be natural to scientists .we have the limitation of intelligence , thoug we do not have the limitation of interest .so if you try to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , eventually you can find your knowledge very superficial .in addition , it is more desirable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result .for example , life scientists concentrate their capacities on studying the system of life .their result helps many people who do not know about the system of life .that is more helpful for our society .all things considered , it is better to specialize in one specific subject thant th have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in respect of individual ability and social advantage as well .
