i donot agree in totality with the statement given as i would like to state some reasons in support for my stand .young people are always inspired to make things happen in all ways including the help for the communities , but , some times they have to pull away themselves from this type of acts when situations donot allow them to do so .firstly , i would like to take the pride saying young people are contributing to a massive extent for the development of their communities .there are people forming groups and associations in their places and a lot of social work is being done by them .this is not new as this process is going on since several years , infact i would say since centuries .they form unions and provide help desks at different places to ensure the problems peple are facing in their communities are solved to the maximum extent .next , these youngsters are always ready and charged ever to their part in the emergency situations like a draught , an explosion , floods and many more .does any one know that a considerable amount of the funds raised for the victims of recent disaster `` tsunami  are by the youngsters only .they are the future of any country and the countries comming years depend on these youngsters itself .moreover they are the ones who join the military , and other educational courses like doctors , enggineers etc .the well known people in these days were youngsters at one stage and the decissions they made at that point made them to be at the place where they are today .if george bush or any other didnot take up good courses at the teenage , would they be here at the position they are now .in my country still the largest group that comes forward first in any situation is the youngsters group .they are allset to do any type of help like moving injured ones to hospitals , raising funds for the needed , and lend their hand in every possible way .however in contrast to the reasons i have staed above some people are not encouraged to do such activities .this is due to the environment they are grown up .if the parents encourage their children to do help to the society these situations donot occur .also the increasing demands of finance and work loads are leaving the youngsters , who are willing to do some help to their community , helpless in such situations .but they definitely take time in their leisure to make some good changes in the areas they can can afford to do something .finally i would like to conclude on the note that youngsters are always ready to do the required help to the society if the situations permit and some freedom is provide from their work places .
