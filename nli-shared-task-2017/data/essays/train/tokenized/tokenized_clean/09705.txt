humans are curious by nature .we tend to know more and explore the areas which we are unsure about .curosity in turn , causes new invention and thus improves our living style as we can see in the case of developing technology .in my opinion , risks are a part of new inventions and it helps us knowing more about the unresolved mysteries that exists like the part of neuroscience still under development .risks open new path for developments .people working for nasa , take several risks of trying out new things which were never tried before .landing on moons , launching rockets with human beings in it to get an exact picture of space .nasa is at its peak of success and it s much more because of its ability to try out new things .trying out new things add adventure to life .without taking any sort of risks life would be like a stagnant pool of water with steady results or rather no change in the usual life style .risks are a little dangerous as the word itself might suggest but it does open up new dimensions for human to work on and explore more .risks are not to be scared from .if taken in limited and sensible amounts , it will have more positive effects than negative .nasa does nt take a step without a scientific background to the information it works on .they calculate and prepare for the worst and achieve succesful results exploring new facts about space science .there is a well known saying called , `` no risks , no gain .it emphasizes on the fact that risks are a part of exploration process .without risks there wont be much to learn new things from .almost every job has some components that provide the employee with certain challenges to deal with , which might involve taking some risks or doing something new out of the usual practise .
