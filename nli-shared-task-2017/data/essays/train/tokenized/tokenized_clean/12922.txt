i do agree with the statement but with a few reservations , regarding exeptions .young people these days are being more occupied with their priority , with this i mean , clearly , helping their communities is not their priority .why are the priority changing ?a mother telling his ten year old child , not to let anybody use his geomatry box .their indeed is a need to think , where and whats going wrong .achild who is being constantly tought to be selfish can not be expected to grow upto a responcible citizen .if not solely , the way the children are being brought up , is the responcible factor .with the increasing compitition in every field of life , and a constant reminder to win the world , is exerting immence pressure on todays s generation , this is leads to lack of time , for the child to think of waht should he be actually doing .exposure to the world through the advancements in the media and other sources , are giving a bigger picture of life to the children .with this they are able to locate where do they stand .there can be two ways a child takes it , eighter as a motivation or facination .it is here that i justify my reservation in supporting the sentence .there are children who are motivated to help their communities , by understanding their problems through comparision with what they have learnt from the advanced media .on the other hand the youngsters who are facinated , which majority of them are , end up doing nothing for their community and the society at large .they tend to run towars what is facinating and forget what they aught to do .to conclude , i would say that the majority of youngsters do not have a strong eternal desire to do something for their community , nor do they feel responcible towards it .may it be because of the way they are being brough up .of the way they want to be .but some are striving to man
