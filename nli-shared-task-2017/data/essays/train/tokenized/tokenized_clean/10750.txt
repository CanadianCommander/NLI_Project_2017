in todays modern time every things are developing at a very fast pace .the youth is in the fore front .but is the youth really delivering what is expected from it ?is it giving enough time to help its communities .well i would be glad to say that yes the youth is delivering in this aspect also .the various youth organisations , active participation and awareness in varied strata s os society does make me believe this .firstly we see various youth oraganisations existing at all levels right from college level to society level and even state level .as it is rightly said the potential of tomorrow lies in the present , the current represenattion and efforts of the youth we sholud have no doubt in seeing a bright future ahead .todays youth apart from individual intersets is seen involving in issues of communities and country .the recent controvertial issue of reservations though must not have ended but has defiantely indicated the large awareness and unity in youth .the incredible youth participation from all over the country has indicated its strong presence .as we know youth have power both physically and mentally to bring changes and it is being tapped .we find youths entering politics which until recent was not a trend .today we do see young individuals entering politics with a intention to improve life .their has been realisation that youth has to have a say on bigger and imporatant issues .we have students representing countries at international level and voicing their opinions .to those who say that todays youth is only interested in fun and personel achievements i would like to tell them that such individuals are wrongly interpreted .youths are generally mistaken to refrain from social funtions and lost in their own friend circles .i would like to say is that youth may have its own way of contributing to community .for example a youth may prefer going for a movie or chilling out with friends in his spare time but he may not delay in coming ahead in contributing when it matters the most .there is a crucial phase in every individuals life where one has to focus on certain aspects of life .thus when young one will always want to have a personal security first then think about others or society in particular .thus for young people at critical stage of career may seem to limiting themselves but are defianately not making them negligent towards communities .i believe the community does get the inputs from young people and with the various points discussed above we can have a positive and encouraging future for sure .
