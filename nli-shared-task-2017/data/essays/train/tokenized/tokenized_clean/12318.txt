some people considered that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i disagree with the sataements .although it seems to be a sound satement , but i think it is a sweeping generalization by the following reasons .first of all , we should focus the problems only on young people .by the accelerating of the modern city life , speed makes us hard to know about people living in the samecommunity with us .young people may have responsibilities to help their communities , but we should not only asked them to do it .all the people in the same communities should try to help it .secondly , how many time should we ask them to pay for these communities ?more time spending means more improvment of thse communities ?today we can do some contributions to our communites services though internet .maybe we should try to set a system that can work on the area of communities services in tweenty four hours .finally , the difinition of commmunities are much unclear .there are a lot of virtual communities in the world of internet .do they help people ?yes , they did held peolple .we should not ristrict the ranges of helping the scieoty .may be it is better to let different groups help each other .in conclution , i fully disagree the satement that young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their communities , and thses are the reasons why .
