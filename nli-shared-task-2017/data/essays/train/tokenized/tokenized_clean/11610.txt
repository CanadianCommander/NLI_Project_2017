although there is a good reason for advertising products , i believe that advertising make products seem better .three reasons convince me that advertising is making products appear much better .firstly , with the development of new technologies it is much easier today to adjust pictures or films as you wish .flaws or even scratches can disappear by just a mouse click .the use of moderne software even helps to make fat things look slimmer , which you can see on pictures that show legs wearing stockings .secondly , good looking things sell better .the first reason for a company is to sell their products because they live on it and exist on it .therefore companies are willing to do the best to let their product be the best even if it ; s only by appearance on a big screen or wallpaper hanging somewhere at the train station or elsewhere .a product that is not attractive to the customer will stay with the company .companies are using female and male models to support their product .they want to give us a feeling that if these models use this product we - the customer - can trust them becuase faces and behavior in front of us can not be a lie .thirdly , companies use movies to offer their products .when ever people switch on the televison they can not escape the comercials shown for hours and hours on the screen or at the cinemas in your hometown and of course all over the world .by using this intensive propaganda technique customers are not save anymore .customers rarely find a niche to avoid advertisments and their apealing looks .for this intensive attack on customers the companies spend libarally amounts of mony .they develop special movies to reach all customers around the globe .even in movies we find again the above mentioned method that models are use to support a specific item and it ; s advantages .so , many actors and actress make money by the way .customers like to identify themself with these movie stars and this leads to an increase in selling .even if customers have nt tried such products before thy just rely on what thy are told or have seen .in summary , we only knew things from tv or movies but we have great interst in buying it because we have seen it or believe an artifical picture
