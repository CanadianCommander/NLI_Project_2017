the advertisement is a way to promote a product with the goal to sell it for the price you gave him .in this definition is an obvious answer to the subject : advertisements have to make products seem much better than they really are to be efficient .but today the advertisement is not only focused on the product itself , also on the image of a brand .those two are different ways to promote and sell a product , and therefor are different answers of the topic .both of them will be studied in a paragraph .the advertisement that promote directly the product is generally a demonstration of its efficiency , its power , etc .advertisers are obviously attracted to make the product seems much better than it really is .it can work if the product is anyway the best of its category or for a certain period of time .but if the customers discover a controversial `` truth  about the real capacity of the product , the lie of the advertisement will be a very bad promotion and will result to an image of a firm not capable .for example , sony promoted a lot its computers with advertisements that show them very powerful .unfortunatly , their batterie was deficient , so sony has now to call them back to change them .the image of sony is now affected by this problem , and moreover because the advertisement lied .the second type of the advertisement is when the brand only try to give herself an attractive image instead of trying to promote a specific product .for example , the coca-cola company does nt promote directly its drinks , but try to give an image that is attractive for the customer .in this kind of advertisement , there is no need to give a false image of the product because it is only the brand that will attract more customers .to conclude , i will say that the different ways to promote a product and the problems they each carry show how the topic is too general to be a true statement .
