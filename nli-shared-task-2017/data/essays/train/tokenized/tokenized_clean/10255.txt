i disagree with the statement that a student should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one .studying about several subjects at a time will not give the student a chance to know completely about any of the subjects .if a student is not allowed to learn about any one subject in detail , he would end up having little knowledge of every subject .this will not help him to be successfull in any of the fields that he has studied about .he has to decide on one subject or a field and should get into maximum possible details of the subject .it is quite impossible for a student to get into details of each and every subject .one has to be gifted with superficial powers to be able to master about all subjects .considering an expample of a group of architecture students .learning simple information about every aspect of building design will not help them do a good design individually .if the group is devided and each student is made to specialize on each aspect of buliding design in detail , the whole group would finally be designing a very successfull project together .this is more like the idea of devide and rule .so , a student should be let to study about a subject in detail .in the above example one student could get into design , another student into structural aspects of a building , another into interior decoration and many more like this .finally this group turns out to be a very succesfull architectural firm .hence it is clear that when any student is made to study about many subjects and none of them in detail would put him in trouble .a student has to specialize on one subject .this helps him to gain his interest and focus his concentration towards one direction .he may also do good research on the particular subject and invent new things .so , it is always advantageous to specialize on one specific subject than to have little knowledge about many things at a time .
