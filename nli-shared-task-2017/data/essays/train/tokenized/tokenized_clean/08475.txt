i agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem mech better than they really are .and i think this a natural behaviour for the advertisement business .in order to understand that , we should ask the question `` why do companies advertise ?.advertisement is a tool to increase the profits of a company through the increase of production , which also means that the increase in sales .today , lots of companies use advertisements and advertisement is a vital tool for companies .however , only a few of them really care about whether the advertisements are true .for that reason , advertisement is known as the art of lying in order to sell .advertisements can be seen everywhere , on the bus , at school , etc .there is no way for a modern person to escape it .so it a suitable tool for companies to introduce their products .however , this introduction sometimes includes wrong informations about their products .for example , a company can make people believe that its products are protective to sun eventhough scientists claim the failure of products strongly .the public forgets what the scientists say in a few days .and they are left with the advertisement that tells them to use the u.v. protective products of that company .as you can see , the advertisement is succesful as it can make people buy that thing but it is misleading .besides its bad or unethical usage , advertisements can help people in some ways .if they are really used for their mentioned purpoes of introducing new products , they acknowledge the customer .so , the customer will be able to learn the properties of the product and will have an opprtunity to compare different types .by that way , he can buy a better product for a better price .this is the ethical and expected use of advertisements .however the real life is not that smooth .to sum up , it can be stated that the unethical use of advetiesments cause misleading of people .however , companies dont care that point as its importantance is related to their profits for them .however , the ethical use of that tool can help customers in many ways .
