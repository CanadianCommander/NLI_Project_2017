eventhough a tour guide can provide the traveller detailed and additional information about a place , i believe that the best way of travelling is in a group of people that self manage themselves .to me , travelling represents one of the finest and happiest moment of my life .it allows me to free my mind from the everyday routine through the discovery of a new country , different people , social customs and behaviors .for this reason , i like to organize my journey by myself , leaving open a lot of possibilities during the travel instead of planning the package `` ex ante  with a tour guide .furthermore , nowadays it is very easy to obtain relevant information about a specific journey .travellers guides and the incredible amount of information contained in the internet can defintely help filling the informational gap of a traveller without hiring a specific person from the place .in my opinion travelling is a constant process of discovery the reality that sorrounds me .this is a learning by doing process in which every mistakes leads to a potential unexpected and positive situation that otherwise would nt had occured .on the other hand , the presence of a tour guide would inevitably make the journey very precise and strictly scheduled without allowing for the possibility of errors and unexpected situations .this combination of failures and successes makes me feel part of the place i am visiting and , at the same time , it gives me the incredibile opportunity to get in touch and talk with many people .the contact with locals is crucial in the discovery process of the travel and the presence of a tour guide would undermine a lot the ability to interact with other people .for all these reasons i strongly believe that traveling alone or with a group of good friends led by themselves is the best way of enjoying and taking advantage of the full potentials of a journey .
