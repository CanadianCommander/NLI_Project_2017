while it is important specialize in one area , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific are particularly before decing the area of expertise .it is because it is rarely the case that an event can be explained by focusing only on one area of academics .furthermore , it is critical to have well-rounded appreciation for any number of subjects in order to determine the area to specialization .the world is full of examples where a broad knowledge of academic subjects is criticall in understanding the present situations .understanding the war in iraq , for example , will require one to have an in-depth knowledge of politics , economics , business , religion , social and ethnic issues , and naitonal security or defense .one can not explain the situations without at least having some understanding of all surrounding issues .( for example , can we leave out discussions on oil and focus only on pursuing democracy ? )although focusing on one particular issue is important , it can be achieved only after one has become aware of the fact that many of the events and issues are closely intertwined with one another .the purpose of the general or required courses that the universities offer to the first-year students is to provide them with opportunities to broaden their ideas and interests .these courses allow students to experiment , by allowing them to take courses in the areas that they might not have otherwise considered taking .being exposed to a number of subjects forces one to `` connect the dots  and to analyze .for example , in one course on religions of african diaspora , i learned that understanding of religions , politics , and social factors were necessary to appreciate those religions .had my focus been only on one issue , i certainly would not have had as much fascination with the significance of certain items or rituals than i did .therefore , i believe that while it is important to specialize in one specific subject , it should be done only when one has obtained braod knoweldge of many academi subjects .hence , it can be argued that having broader knowledge is better than specializing in one area .
