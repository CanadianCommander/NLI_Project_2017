what are students going to school for ?do they learn the thing that are nescessary for them ?students are asked to understand ideas and concepts from the subjects they are learning .they are also asked to learn facts from past experiences .however , which one is the thing they need more , understanding ideas or learning facts ?in my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students .to begin with , students go to school because they need to gain knowledge that are needed for their future .student should be able to understand that the ideas and concepts of the subjects they are studying , so that they will understand the subjects easier .for example , the use of a mathematical formula , the rule of a chemical equation .without the understanding the ideas and concept , they do not know how to use it and when should they apply it on .as being a student , i think that when student have the ideas and concepts of something , they will eventually understand the facts of something too .since a fact of an event or object is actually the result of the development of a centain kind of ideas and concepts .in the other word , ideas and concept are the basic requirement for student to learn a facts .moveover , some people think that learning facts is more improtant for students than understand ideas and concepts .it is because they believe that facts is more easier for students to understand something nesscessary for thier life .but their never understand that facts can only tell use the surface of somethings , not the meaning that are behind them .in conclusion , it is improtant for students to know both the ideas and concepts and facts of what they are learning .however , ideas and concepts are the basic elements for them the study a subject .facts may not be able to show the main point they need to know .as a result , student should focus on the ideas and concepts before they take the next step to learn the facts .
