to answer this question , it is also important to know about the intentions advertisers have .for sure they want to spot their products into a brighter light , because they want to persuade the customers to buy their product .generally you can assume , that a good manager does not want to make his product better than it actually is , but he wants to picture his product relatively better than the competitors  products .therefore an advertisement sometimes make products seem much better than they really are , but it does not have to be .in cases advertises exaggerate , it will arouse negative dissonances at the customers and they will be very unsatisfied .on the other hand the statement depends a lot on the interpretation of the potential customer s behaviour .if he interprets the advertisement in that way , then it is absolutely unimportant what the advertiser wanted to express with the advertisment .due to this two points of view ( advertiser or manager vs. customer )i do not agree to this statement entirely .maybe , because i am tried to be both .a manager as well as a customer .nonetheless if this statement is true or not , you should always make the assumption , that an advertisement does not reflect the reality correctly .if you do not make this assumption , you possibly get disappointed , when you buy a product , many times .this probably will happen , because not every manager takes into account , that negative dissonances can have bad consequences to the consumers  behavior .additionally you should not forget another party , which is involved into the process of developing an advertisment .it is the advertisement-agency .the always want to exaggerate and put everything into nice and beautiful colors .many times the have so much influence into the ad finally , in short words , i do not agree to the statement , but i would tell everybody , that an intelligent customer always takes this possibility into account .otherwise you eventually put your money into the wrong investment .
