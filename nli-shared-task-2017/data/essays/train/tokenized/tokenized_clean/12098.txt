to know and how much to know , that is the questioni always define my generation as based on the lyrics of a brazilian pop song of the 80s which said , `` i know a little about almost everything , and almost everything i know badly  .on my day and age , a popular teenager would have to know about a vast array of topics , ranging from boy george to the cure , not leaving aside shakespeare .of course , these are not exactly academic subjects , so an academic knowledge of boy george would not be necessary , but we would have to at least have heard of him .shakespeare , however , is not only part of the academy , but also of a canon .would it be better , then , to know everything about the bard and all of his forty plays , or to know a few vital facts about him and still have time to study orwell , huxley , nabokov , salinger , woolf , twain and steinbeck , not to mention less canonical authors ?it s hard to say , since there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach .one obvious con to having a broad knowledge of several subjects is that this knowlegde will eventually become superficial .lack of time will make it impossible to dedicate too much attention to one subject , and its treatment might be shallow and futile .on the other hand , knowing many subjects will surely enhance our conversational skills in social gatherings .let s just say that knowing macbeth superficially wo nt be enough to write a thesis on the play , but it might impress some friends at a party .it depends on the situation .although i do nt have a fixed opinion on this subject , i m more inclined to having broad knowledge about many topics than merely knowing one topic exhaustively .in school at least , we have to be introduced to many academic subjects , for how will we know where to choose from and what interests to pursue if we only , say , know algebra ?as we go deeper and deeper into our studies , however , we will inevitably have to narrow down our interests , and dedicate more time to fewer subjects , even running the `` risk  of becoming specialists .nevetheless , as much as i love shakespeare , dedicating all my academic existence to him and him only would give me the impression of missing something .
