cars are one of the major means of transportnow a days .many people use cars as they are more convienient means of transport .they save time and energy in reaching our destiny .but in my opinion in comming twenty years their will be fewer cars than they are now .firstly now a days most cars run on petrol , desiel , gasoline .these are fossile fuels .due to increase in the population over past 20 years , more cars came into market there is a great demand for the fuel .but the fuel reserves are limited .this leads to the shortage of the fuel in the comming years .more over due to high demand for the fuel the fuel prises will go up .the rise in the fuel prices can not be afforded by the common man. this will make him look for other means of transportation may be public transportation such as buses , trams .due to advancement of technology the prices of the cars decreased rapidly , this decrease in the price made comman man to own a car .as the population is increasing many people started owning a cars , this leads to the traffic congestion in the cities and towns .the presents roads may not be sufficient to accomodate the cars present , and it is difficult to expand the roads to the reqirement of the people owning the car .this leads to traffic jams and takes lots of time reaches their destination which was the advantage of owning a car .so most people will avoid cars in the comming years .due to increase in cars the pollutions increases rapidly .there will be a lot of air pollution and noise pollution .this leads to the global warming .to avoid damange there is no other option than controlling the polution .taking these effects into consideration the goverment may concentrate on the public means on transportation , as this saves fuel , pollution and traffic congestion .earlier people thogth that having a car is prestige but in future they feel its head ache to own a car and maintain it , they will move for other better means of transportation in comming years .
