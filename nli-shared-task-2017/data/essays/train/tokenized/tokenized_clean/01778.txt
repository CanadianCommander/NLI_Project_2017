i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .to discuss it , i need to difine the meaning of `` successful people  for me .successful people are people who found out their meaning of life .to discover it , the process of seeking is neccessary .the process is the same as trying new things .trying new things takes risks .i call people who are doing same things without taking risks as `` unsuccessful people  .it is because they do not live their life thoroughly .they already stop seeking .it means they are loosing their chance to find the meaning of life .it is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them .therefore searching it is very important factor for thier success .for example , michael jodan , one of the most famous basketball player in the world , was used to be a baseball player when he was a child .when he entered high school , he started to play basketball .then he realized it was the best thing to do for him .however , he was not sure about he could become a professional bascketball player .but he tried it and made it .he retired already , but everyone of basketball fun remenbers him vividly .another example is roger federer , no.1 tennis player in the world .like michael jordan , he also did not know he was good at tennis until he became a journior high school student .he was not a strong player before then .finally , as i stated above , i believe trying new things with taking risks are important element for successful people .life is not an easy thing .to succeed in the real meaning , i have to keep serching the meaning of it .
