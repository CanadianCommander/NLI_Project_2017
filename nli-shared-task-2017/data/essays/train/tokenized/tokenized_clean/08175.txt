as much as i wish for it to be true for the sake of the environment and the future of of our ecological system , i have a hard time agreeing with the statement : `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .ever since the introduction of the `` t-model  by henry ford using mass production technologies in the 1920 s , the number of cars has started to increase in exponential factors .this is due to a number of factors which i believe are irrevocable in our modern day world .firstly , our technology is changing at such a fast pace that we do not know if and how to tame it .thus , it is becoming ever easier to design and manufacture cars .the number and variety of car models abundant in our everyday life is natural proof for this point .there is wide range of cars available for sorts of tastes and budgets .secondly , as the world economy progresses , the purchasing power of nations and individuals increase although not at the same rate .for example , even though let us say that some 3rd world countries are not as rich as their european or north american counterparts , the streets are jammed with cars in capitals of india , egypt , etc .cars are becoming more and more accessible in the remotest and the most impoverished locations .whereas it was not easy for a young woman from kazakhistan to own her own car , it is not as unthinkable today as it once was .lastly , i believe that we , as individuals , are becoming more and more addicted to our cars .whereas a household used to have one car in the 1970 s or so , now the number of cars per household is increasing rapidly .this is in part necessitated by the rapid and hectic lifestyles brought about by the modern world and in part by what we call `` conspicious consumption  in economics .if your neighbour changes to a better version , you like to do the same due to psychological factors even though your current car may be perfectly functional and comfortable .this naturally `` drives up  the market for cars .we can not think of ourselves without our cars .our daily routines are completely disturbed if we have to go to the office without our car .as a result of these and similar factors which i believe to be irrevocable , the number of cars will continue to increase despite environmental concerns .i also believe that this trend will continue for even more than twenty years .however , it is a comforting thought that the negative effects may be somewhat decreased if car manufacturers start focusing on enviromentally friendly hybrid and diesel models .
