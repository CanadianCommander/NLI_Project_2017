i do not agree at all with the fact that is more important for students to understand concepts rather then learning facts .therefore my opinion is that both those goals are needed to be accomplished from a student during his or her studying period , this could be hight school or university .preciselly it is even more important at university because , in this period of his life , the student is suposes to learn a job .for instance i studied political science in italy , at la sapienza university , witch is considered one of the best universyties in my country .while i was learning all the subjects of my courses i realized that they where perfect and complete in the teoretical areas but they lacked in the practical areas .for example in the law course whe studied all the articles of our civil code , and the professor was very strict during the exam .on the other hand nobody of the students had the chance to looked to an example of contract .obviously this is a really important part of the course , in fact a friend of mine who studied with me , had enourmous difficulties on working after graduating .she went working in a very famous law farm , and she had to work four months not beeing payed because she did nt know how to write a contract .althought i had another fantastic experience that confirm my opinion .a couple of years ago i went studying at the international center of photography in new york city .eventhought i was a little afraid of studying with a different system i found it much easier and much more challengin at the same time , even if it seem a contradiction it is not !in this school i learned a lot about the theory of photography , like tecniques and history of photography .yet i practiced even more .i shoot with lots of different kind of cameras , the view camera , a digital camera and the olga .for all these reasons i think learning facts and how to practice them in the real life is very important for all students .
