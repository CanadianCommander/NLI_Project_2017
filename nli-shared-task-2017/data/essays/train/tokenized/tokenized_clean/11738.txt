`` everybody back to the bus please !the voice of the tourguide was as distressing as the shrill sound of my alarm clock on a monday morning .we had had only five minutes to look at the exibited apollo rocket , when we were called back this way , off to the next sight .the short drive was made unpleasant by the overly obese neighbor , who spilled into my seat and pressed me against the glass of the window .this is , how i remember my trip to cape caneveral in florida on a guided tour , one of a group of 24 tourists .not an enjoyable memory .some people like to travel that way .i think that traveling in a group led by a guide is almost a guarantee for a regrettable experience .first of all , you have to do what the guide tells you .the plans were made under consideration of the special logistics and economics that a group brings with it , by people you do nt know .on a trip to spain i took with a group , i was not able to visit a church i had read about and which interested me .instead i had to go to a so-called `` spanish evening  ( in spain ! )to see mediocre flamenco dance and eat less-than-great paella .then , of course , you are constrained by the time table that was set for the group .you can not linger around a sight that fascinates you .no , you have to rush off , in order to check off another item the agenda .a friend of mine told me how he was rushed through the tower of london by his tour guide , although he really wanted to spend more time there to connect with the circumstances of the prisoners which were once held there .and , above all , you do nt chose your travel companions .the behaviour of other group members is sometimes the straw that breaks the camels back .the perfect example herefor is maybe the movie `` trains , plains and automobiles  .all this should make it clear , that it is better to travel with people one knows and likes .and to make one own s plans .
