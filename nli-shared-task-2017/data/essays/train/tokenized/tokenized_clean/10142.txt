as told by our ancestors `` knowledge is wealth  , adding to that most of the individuals today believe that its better to be knowledgable about as many subjects as you can apart from your academics .knowledge is never confined to one particular subject or topic it increases along with your intetrest .not many people try to explore knowledge base available around them .a person can do miracles in his academics but a person who can out perform in an area which is out of his scope would be appreciated for his achievement .any student need not try to learn everything available in the library but going an extra mile studying something which is not related to his academics but which helps him in real life always benefits him .it may be history , politics or science anything of that matter .nowadays students realised the use of being more knowledgable about external affairs which always been part of a normal conversation they have .many students who try to acquire bookish knowledge need to be taught about the importance of realtime knowledge .apart from academic subjects we can make atleast basics of other subjects mandatory for students by which they turnout to be more knowledgable .taking an example of biology student who is workng in a laboratory with electrical equipment may not be aware of the amount of power he is playing with , which might even cost him his life , so it would be beneficail to eduacte him about working of electricity as well .this allows him to be more careful when he is dealing with something which is not of prior importance to him .at the end i would like to say that it always helps you to grow as an individual when you derive as much as you can from the vast knowledge base available around you !!!!!
