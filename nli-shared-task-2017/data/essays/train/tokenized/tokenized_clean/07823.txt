in the world today , it is definetly much better to have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject without having the knowledge of the other subjects .however , it should be a priority in life to have both .as people learn about the various subjects , they can conclude which subject is to their most interest and that subject will be the one in which that person will specialize in the future .for one , as a cultural purpose it is important to have the knowledge that the world offers .if someone is a doctor for example , and they do nt know about the world of politics , or about history , about writing , music , etc , than they will be considered ignorant .it is essential to be able to flow in a conversation with different types of people .in the case of a doctor who is from the united staes , if he/she is having a conversation with a doctor from bolivia , than it is important for him/her to know about the country s history , political status , culture or issues .if this doctor meets with an artist , than he/she should know about the arts in order to flow in that conversation .another example could be a student .if a student wants to be a journalist , that person must have the broad knowledge about all academic subjects in order to be able to write about each different topic .also in a college interview or in a job interview , you never know what they are going to ask you .it is extremely important for a person to be highly aware about everything in the world .everything is connected .even for the future , when one has retired from their specialized job they will have for the rest of their lives , the knowledge and the experience of the many academic subjects that enrich the world .when they say `` you only have one life , so live it  , this quote applies to gaining this enrichment of the knowledge that a human being can aquire .
