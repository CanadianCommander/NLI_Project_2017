in the 1960 , taylorism made its apparition .taylorism like fordism were new organizational stuctures for enterprises , where each employee was specialized in one task .the consequenses of this new type of organization led to the increase of the turnover of companies .but can we state that specialization in knowledge is better than broad knowledge of many subjects ?specialization in one specific subject can be really an advantage , in my opinion , when the subject is a rare one .moreover , i believe that for a very specific and detailed subject , someone who is interested to make it his profession , should specialize his self as much as he can .i explain this position by the fact that for rare subject where few people have the knowledge and only few people can work on it , specialization will be the main advantage in front of competitors in the same domain .the specialization can present , in contradictory with the previous paragraph , some disadvantages .indeed , by specializing ourselves , we can adapt to a new job with more difficulties .flexibility and the ability to adapt is one the main criterias for management .furthermore , in management , being specialized in an industry , a type of job , a department or a task makes us too difficult to change job and can be a constraint for our evolution in the company .we need to specialize ourselves , but not too much otherwise we become rigid .in conclusion , i believe that we need to have a balance between specialization and broad knowledge of many academic subjects .we have to find the correct balance between the two in order to be flexible and adaptable , in order to be able to response to any problems that appears but also specialiazed in one topic to have the best knowledge in front of competitors .
