many people asserted that youg people nowadays do nt give enough time to helping their communities .although it would easy to accept this statement at fact value , it is such a complex one .personally , i disagree this statement for two reasons .the first reason for my disagreement is that personailty .a man s worth is not lie in what he has but lie what he is .that is to say , personailty is essentially .take me for example .when i was college student , even we had a lot of things to do , we still seprated the rest of time to helping our communities .we do a lot of things such as assisted taking care homeless child , play with them , and read story for them .therefor , i did nt yough people spend few of time to helping their communities .another reason is that young people would like to enrich their experice and increase their awareness and consiciousness .to help their communties is nessary and important .young people will spend a lot of time to helping people who is ineed .they thinks is valuableto do this .so , i do nt believed that young people do nt give enough time to helping their communitied .all of these reasons have deeply influenced my point of view on thia issue .that is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit .however , i believed that the reasons i have provided in favor of my point of view are stronger .
