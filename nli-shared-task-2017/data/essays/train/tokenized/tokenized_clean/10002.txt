i have ever believed that it is more important for students to understands concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , when one understands something he or she probably remeber this idea for a long time .instead when one just learn a fact , probably he or she soon forget it .next , when one understand an idea , it is possible to reuse this idea in similar contexts that simetimes have to be faced during one s life .as einstein said , `` imagination is more important than knowledge  , and i think that undertanding effort stimulates imagination , as well as the ability to infer .moreover , whenever one understand a new difficult concept , he or she feels a kind of satisfaction and become a little more confident .i think that this is important to find out new breakthroughs and the world has ever improved thanks to new ideas and discoveries .however , learning facts is important too .for instance i think that studying history is helpful to avoid errors and mistakes .in fact studying history , students learn bad consequences of wars and mistakes in general so that they can do better in the future .in conclusion i think that that students should do their best in order to undertand the more they can from teacher s lectures and books .
