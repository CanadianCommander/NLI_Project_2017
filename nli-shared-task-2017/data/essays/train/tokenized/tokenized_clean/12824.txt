i agree with the statement on understanding ideas and concepts for a student is more important than learning facts .a distinction should be made between students in the phase of learning for developing skills for improving understanding of the life and those in the process of learning for a specific work .the latter may necessitate knowing exact details for the proper practice of a work .nevertheless , improving understanding of ideas and concepts is more important to have a capacity to understand life .first of all , a good reasoning develops with understanding ideas and concepts .a student memorizing all the facts knows nothing indeed if he or she could not find the linkage between the facts .for example , a student may memorize dates of historical events .however , identifying causes and effects will be provided thorough analyzing ideas and concepts .secondly , as it is the era of information , a bulk of facts are encountered every day and they are prone to change with a rapid pace .it is important to extract a useful bundle of information from there .in that sense , ideas and concepts provide a frame for evaluating everchanging facts .to conclude , considering the students undertake learning for developing skills for better understanding , ideas and concepts should be given utmost priority in the learning process .
