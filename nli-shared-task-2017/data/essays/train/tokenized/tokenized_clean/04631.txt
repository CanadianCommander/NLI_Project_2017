people percieve enjoyment in different ways .enjoyment for me may mean playing soccer but at the same time enjoyment for my grandpa may mean meditating or reading .i may endorse enjoyment in a different sense .enjoyment is a personal view and not a general one .i would refute the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .enjoyment is associated with very phase of life in its own way , carrying a special meaning .before the teenage , playing with friends for long hours may be the ulimate source of enjoyment for kids .during the teenage however , chatting with friends on the phone , talking to the opposite sex may be thrillling & enjoying .typical pangs of adolosence as we call it .post teenage , i.e college life , we may like to hang out with our friends for parties , movies , festivals etcetra .it would certainly mean enjoyment .pre-marriage job life would add some other kind of dimension to the definition of enjoyment of life like going out for shopping .post-marriage enjoyment may mean bringing up kids , playing with them , making them study .my parents say that my birth was the best moment of their lives .old age may seek enjoyment in morning walks , playing with grandchildren , meditation .it could be the time when one introspect and see how well have they lead their lives and how can they make it even better .that would certainly make life more enjoyable .we may enjoy life doing things alone or we enjoy life in comany of friends .its basically the way we see enjoyment .enjoyment has different faces to it which show up at the right time or the right phase of life .branding enjoyment of life to only a particular segment of age may not justify the essence of enjoyment .living every moment to the fullest and the best one can is the is thrust of enjoyment .
