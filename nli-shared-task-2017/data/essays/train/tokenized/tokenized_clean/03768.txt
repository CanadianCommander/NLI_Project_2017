every day we can see a lot of successful people in the street , in our school , in our place of work , in our house .i think that successful people have a lot of courage because generally they take their success from try new things , new solutions , something that nobody have try before .it is a great risk because no one can know if a solution is good or no .the success of that people belong to this courage .they have no fear to try something new .it is good but it is also dangerous because in some cases it is more dangerous than pleople can think .a lot of businnes men are famous , rich and successful because they try something new , and in a lot of cases dangerous .in fact a lot of people lost everythink they have as conseguence of their take risks .in the other hand doing what they already know is more simply .some people prefer doing something that they already know because they prefer to do it very well even that doing something that they do nt know .if they do something that they do nt know the ca nt do it very well .in my opinion it s important to find a compromise of these two ideas .it s important to try new things in order to became successful and it s not sufficient to do something that is already known .but it s also important be carefull and not to take risk that can be too dangerous .it s important to think a lot before doing something important for our success , and it s also important to think about all variabilities than we can find , and all the problems that we can find when we try to do something that we have never do before .i say these things because i am very carefull .i do nt be the kind of person that try to do something new without thinking about all consequences that the action can produce .
