as these society is very development , many academic fields generate in the university .some people argue that specialized education is efficient to develop the students .however , in my opinion , studying various academic subjects is better for this society .first of all , it is clear that the university students  should have a various knowledge .accumulating many academic study , they would develop because they could use their knowlege in the fields that not only thier major but also other fields .for example , i have a cousin who major is law .although he had hard to make a time to study other fields , he studies ecomomy also .at last he could enter the big famous economic company as a lawyer .he is so happy that the salary is high and he can use his all knowledge .many people arould him admire him because they belive that he knows a lot .furthermore , there is no question that the society is needed talents that have the various knowledge .this world is not simple so only one field s subject could nt do anything .these academic fields consist that science with ethic , politic with media and education with psycology .according to the believable reaserch , many university students are double-major because many company need a talent person that have more a two major .i also did also tow major , journalism and jepanese .so i could enter a japanese newscompany .
