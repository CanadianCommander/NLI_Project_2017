in my opinion , the young people nowerdays are dedicated and dovouted to help their communities .though no such statistical data exist as of now but being a part of the young generation of india , i myself can support my stance with several examples .the best example that can be qouted is of the recent devastation caused by t-sunami .the vast destruction caused by upsurge of tremendous tidal waves not only affected economically but also led to casualities and serious injuries .in this situation , from primary school children to college graduates united here in india to help the needy .we being the part of this association went door to door to ask for any form of help , that included money , medicines , clothes , food etc .even the ngo s and well acclaimed societies like red cross and sos acknowledged this enthusiastic participation of youth of india and well assured that the funds and support liquidated to the proper cause .t-sunami was just an example and this happened in case of gujrat earthquake and other disastors .though it should not be inferred that this kind of participation is only restricted to natural calamities only .nowerdays , students participate more in programmes like national cadet camps ( ncc ) which go to rural areas to help understand their problems and educate them about certain topics like aids .moreover , blood donation camps is another example of frequent participation of young people to support their communities .appart from that the technological advancement has made it feasible to provide modern and extensive techniques that ultimately leads to social and financial upliftment of communities .in developing countries like india , we are still having a large population that needs to be properly educated .nowerdays more capable and intellect people are getting into politics and civil services .it is the young doctors who cure disease and it is the young engineers who make a village glow at night .the extensive research done now will definately have implications for the betterment of the future .if we look into the situation more practically , we will see that more and more young people are participating in the development and upliftment of their communities .though some population is still not as enthusiastic about community service yet i would state that , `` nothing is perfect  .it will be illogical to expect cent percent participation .thus , to sum up , young people are giving time to help their communities .
