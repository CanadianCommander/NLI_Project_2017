although there are more and more tour agencies today and more and more people are willing to be guided in a travel , i prefer to travel by myself , not in a group .the first thing i should consider when travelling in a group is that i can not arrange all the things by myself .that is , when travelling in a group , i should follow the certain routine and the certein time table .i will be asked to follow the schedule step by step .this makes me feel that i m a little baby who can not control itself .but when travelling by myself .i make my own plan according to my own taste .i do nt need to rush in hours from one place to another .there is a good chance that i can make my own decision .second , more and more tour guides have some business relationships with the merchants in some certain areas .that is , the guides will instigate the visitors to buy the products in the local area .and the guides will get some benefits as well as the merchants if the visitors buy the products because the guides and the merchants have some contracts .the guides  behavior can really mislead some visitors today .it is more likely for the tourists to make some unwise choices and to buy some products unneccessary when led by a guide .when travelling alone , i can make more intelligent choice when deciding which to buy and which not to buy .at last , travelling alone is a good experience for me .and i always have a desire to travel alone around this world , just like many youths .when travelling alone , i will schedule all the things by myself , from making a travel plan to booking the tickets .i think it is a necessary process in one s life to grow up .in fact , although i m still seventeen , i have already traveled alone to many different provinces in my country , even to hong kong .each time i finished these trips , i feel that i m more mature than before and i have gained more experiences .my parents also think that if a person can not do something individually , he or she will not be an adult .in my opinion , travelling alone is a process for me to gain experience .so , i would rather to travel alone , not travelling in a group by a tour guide because i m that kind of person who is very independent .
