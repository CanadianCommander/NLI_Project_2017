youth is often considered as the best part of life .youth means energy , projects , entertainment and happiness .is it a reality ?i think that , in order to answer this question , young people s problems must be showed .youth is a period of tremendous stress and fears .stress can be infered by responsabilities , in front of studies , social life , or studies .for example some cursus are extremely hard and stressfull .it is the case of medicine studies in france , or some businesses studies in japan for example .social life infered fears , because of competition for example .young people want to do their best , but are often disppointed by life .for example , student social movement that france knew in the beginning of the year two thousands six show that young people , even when they have projects and are highly graduated , can feel fear about their future .my opinion is that young people often are more interessed in politics that their parents , because it is about their future .they understand their own situation , and their country s situation .on the contrary , old people can enjoy life .more and more , old people can enjoy life , because they do not work anymore .they can do what they always dreamed to do .as a matter of fact , old people more and more travel , have good standart of living and entertain themselves .it is proved by sociologists that , in some regions , old people are happier than young people of the same region .besides , it is now proved that old people help young people , by giving them money or allowing them to stay in their parent s house whereas they already were living alone when they were young .it is an important evolution of society .young people do not longer help their grandparents , it is the contrary .all those elements tend to show that young people do not enjoy life morethan old people do .
