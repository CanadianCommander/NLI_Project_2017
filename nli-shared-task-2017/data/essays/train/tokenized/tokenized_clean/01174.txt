i think that it s not always possible to generalize on psychological topics so , personally , i would neither agree nor disagree with the statement .i would rather say that it depends on individual situations .take the case of a successful enterpreneur who built up a business in a steady industry without taking risks , and maximized his profits this way .from his experince he learned that things go well without changes .it is unlikely that he is inclined to change his mind after having success with not taking risks .although he s successful !or take the case of someone speculating on stock prices .he has learned , that if you hesitate too long , your profits will be below expectations since stock markets underlie extreme fluctuations .such a person would take risks if he is successful .on the other side there are people who are inspired by their success to try out new things .they are not satisfied with the goals they reached so far and thus think of themselves as capable to reach enw horizons .also , as they reach a certain degree of excellence , and build up stong basis of existing business relationships they become more confident to make a risky decision or try to walk a new path .there will be always that `` net  to catch them if they fall .however , as personal relationships are concerned , i think that truly successful people who are happy with their partner , who have found someone they love , someone to rely upon , are unlikely to take risks unless there are desires buried deep inside of their minds .but it such case those people are nt exactly successful but rather hypocritic .in fact , success is often based on learning from mistakes made in the past .the only way to make mistakes and gain experience is actually taking risks and trying out new things .this would support the idea that successful people are more open to risks since they know that the best learning is often learning from mistakes , sometimes your own .
