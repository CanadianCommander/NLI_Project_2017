i disagree with the this statement that there will be fewer cars in use in next 20years .i think people drive more cars than nowdays .in the future , people will have more money than now , and there will be many place to go to enjoy life .also people will think privacy so important .so they would not share the car .many kinds of cars also effected that there would be more cars than today .as time goes by , world is becoming so convinient place to live in , and technology improves fast .people will have more money than now , for example my father boughts first car when he was 30 , but nowdays many university student have cars including me. many young people prefer to buy car when they grduate highschool , because they have enough money to pay the car .also there are lots of places that people can play .as economy is developed people prefer to go to outside in the leisure time .because of young people has many chance to earn money , they go to lots of places with family , girl friend , and friends .so they want to have their own car .because it is easier to go there when they have their own .in the future , worth of privacy would become more important .the socilal life would be very complex and stressful , people want to go somewhere alone in their free time .as for me , when i have so much stresses i drive alone to beach .also people does nt want to somebody interrupt when they want to rest .for example when i was dating with my girl friend i hate to somebody is wathing me or talk to me .if they have their own car they do nt worry about somebody disturbs them .last of all there would be various car to drive .there would be various desings of car .so if soomone who has lots of money , they world try to many cars , such as sports cars .in future , people would have more money , and have many chance to spend thier money .they will buy their own car to go to many places easily and does nt want to share the car .also various types of car would make rich people want to drive that car .for these reasons , i think there would be more cars than nowdays .
