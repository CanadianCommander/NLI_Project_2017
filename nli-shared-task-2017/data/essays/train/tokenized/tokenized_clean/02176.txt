i totally agree with this statement .firstly , travelling in group led by a tour guide is convenient .leading by a tour guide , you may not have to worry about the issues during the travel .for example , you need not to think about which hotel you shoud choose to live in , where you have a meal , and which cars or trains you should take .every thing is arranged well by tour guide .only thing you need to do is to follow the group , see beautiful sight and enjoy them fully .also , you can get many knowledge and insight from the presentation of tour guide .tour guides is given good training or education on how to introduce the information about sight to tourist .in this sense , they are professional persons who are most familiar with the information of sight .having a introduction from the tour guide , i believe all of you will get comprehensive knowledge without any efforts .however , when you take a lonely travel , no one provides this kind of services and you may miss the best chance to learn about the world sight .moreover , there are often many people in a travel group .i am a sociable person and i like to do many things with other people .i hate loneliness .of course , this include travel .also , making new friends is one of my hobbies .traveling in a group meets all of my needs above .at last , traveling in a group always means low cost .it is well known that single travel spends much more than group travel .now i am not very rich and if i want to travel , i definitly choose group travel .because of all those benefits of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , i believe it is the best way for me to travel .
