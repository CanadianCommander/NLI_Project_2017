given the choice about young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities i agree or disagree .i agree this topic .there are three reasons was followed .first , our eduction never encouraged them : `` you need to help their communities .instead of communities helping always become a way to make them be good .so , they did nt want to join the communities helping .they feel this is not a good thing .second , young people have too many choice to get a right one .today in taiwan , homework always full of young people time .it is impossible that claim they to help communities .young people always feel too tired to do others thing .they only care about their grades .third , young people merely think what is good for them .and their points always on dress , money , entertiment .they did nt want to pay some time or money to help communities .they feel this question of government .to sum up , i think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i think we should educate our young people to helping thier communities .because they can get many benifits when they start to pay their time .helping communities is a good thing we should do it .
