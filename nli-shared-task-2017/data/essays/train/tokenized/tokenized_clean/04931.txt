i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .if the advertisements fail to show the products  virtue , why are the manufacturers advertising their products every day ?it is the basic function of the advertisement .comercials are trying to exaggerate the virtue of products in two ways .first , using the characteristics of media .television , newspaper , and megazine are adapting every possible visual effects on their advertisements in order to show the products brighter than they are .they using lightings and computer based image reprocessing technoligies .there are lots of new thechnoligy used in the advertisements that makes it possible products can be seen as totally different styles and shapes .hence , customers usually disappointed with the real shape and color of the products , especially for economic product with ceap materials .second , showing just good part of the products .even though the advertisement do not lie to customers , exposing only the good part of products means hiding the worse part of the products .hence , if the public see the advertisements , they may think the products are amazing one without any problem .it is the reason why some sophisticate customers try to find rates of other customers for the product they plan to buy .the customers who already used the products can give more accurate information , both pros and cons .it means customers hardly find bad aspects of the products on their comercials .in conclusion , i strongly agree with the idea that advertisemens makes products seem much better than they really are .although advertisements of products can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customers with wrong images .
