i agreee this statement .first of all , considered with the physical aspect , young people have more energy than older people have .this is simple difference .the biggest difference between young people and older people is experience .this experience is the most impotant element for enjoy life .older people experience the life process for example , school , graduation , work , marriage , to have children and so on .needless to say yound people have not exprienced such kind of life experience .therefore every single things towards them are completely new for young people .they are very exsited to be expericed them .the first time to experence something is always fun .however once people experienced something .this something never be the first experience .to get to be familar with new things makes us to remove the feeling of fun .by using another words , older people are surrounded by the things which they had already experienced .in this circumsatnce it is difficult to find out any passion and new feeling .it is just normal for older people .
