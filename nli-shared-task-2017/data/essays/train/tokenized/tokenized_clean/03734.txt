yes i agree with the statement young people enjoy life more than older people do .i think in all aspects young people enjoy more than older people .i think younger people has less responebility than older .if any one have some responebility they may not enjoy like responebility less persons .i observed some points in my friends .some of my friends are donot have any restrictions or responability .they enjoy a lot every day life .it is not possible to older people because mostly they have some responses during old age .like their children education on other financial problems .but these young people dont have such types of problems .and some more reasons for this is health probelms .young people are very active where as older or not .young people can enjoy with out taking any rest for so many hours .where as olders can not do this .better example for this is every weekend i prefer to go some pubs in my city .i can found lot of youngers and olders their .i obseved that youngers dance till the late night .but it is highly dificult to older people .another best example to state this opinion is my life style .am very crazy person .always i want enjoyment in my life .i have lot of friends .am very crazy about making friends .i think making friends also enjoyment for me .because i can roam with my friends in my city .we went movies and restarents .i can found enjoyment with romaing them .i like to travel .i feel it is enjoyment .i make trips frequently .and i enjoyed a lot in that tirps i visiti historical placec in my country .i conclude that young people enjoy life more than older people .
