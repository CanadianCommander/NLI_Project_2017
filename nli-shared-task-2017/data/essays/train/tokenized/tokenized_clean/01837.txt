although older people can enjoy life , i definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people can enjoy eating , travering , and be health .first , young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young .for example , when young people want to eat some great dishes , they can eat all of them .they can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot .however , usually , older people can not eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot .not only can young people enjoy eating , but also they can enjoy travering .if the person who is young wanted to go to somewhere , the person could go there soon .the person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip .however , if the person who is old wanted to go to trip , the person would need a lot of time to prepare the trip .so , young people are very flexible and agressive .these aspects are very important with young people , however , healty is the most important part of young people .older people are suffered from a lot of illnesses .they catch a cold easily , become tired soon , and need a lot of time for their rest .also , they can not play hard sports .however , young people are healty and very agressive .they can play hard sports like baseball , soccur , swimming and so on .young people recover from illnesses soon .in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people do .they can enjoy eating , travering , and be health .young people can do anything that they want to .
