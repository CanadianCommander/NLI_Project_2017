i agree with statement that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide .there are two reasons why , trovel is in a group led by a tour guide is cheeper than private and we may know tour guides recomend placesfirst of all , in a group led by tour guide is more unexpensive than private travel .for example , in private , an airplaine cost 3000 dallar for america from japan .but use the tour industry service wichi can dicline the cost of plaine to 15000dallar .however involve the foods and hotel .it is very cheep .seconds , we could visit a wounderful place if i joined the tour group .guides know a lot of good places in there country .tour guide must study hard about sightseen to become .so tour guide is professional of travel and sightseen .all of theres reason i sustain that the most good way to travel is a led by a tour guide .
