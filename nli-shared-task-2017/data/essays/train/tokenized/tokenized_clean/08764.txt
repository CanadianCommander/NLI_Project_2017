advertising is one of the key factors in the success of a product in market .some people feel that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i do not agree with this and will explain my point of view in the following paragraphs .in today s world , there is a lot of awareness among consumers and the product manufacturers know that they can not fool them by giving false impressions about their product .they know that if they give a false picture of their product in an advertisement , they might fool customers for a short term but in the long run customers will know the real picture .therefore , intelligent and successful businessmen refrain from wrongly advertising their product .thus , we generally do not see an add of a product that projects it falsely .in today s world , only the best products are able to sustain themselves in the market .it is generally these successful companies who can afford to invest and do invest lot of money in advertising .as the market is very competitive , there is little or no difference in the quality of products from two companies .the motive of advertising of such companies is to catch consumers  imagination , to influence them emotionally so that they buy their product instead of their competitor s product .therefore , i do not think that companies that manufacture products that do not meet the market standards ever advertise their product .neither do they have the money nor is it worth spending money because there are better products available in market and consumers already know that .if we observe the advertisements nowadays , we find that they are very creative .companies sometimes do blow up their product in their advertisement but that is just to make their add more interesting and appealing than that of their competitor .they do not project wrong information about their product .therefore , i feel that advertisements project the product that they advertise correcty and that in today s world , they can not survive in the market if they advertise a product falsely .
