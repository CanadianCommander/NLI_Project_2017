in my opinion , to learn facts is more important to understand ideas and concepts .because learning facts would be practical and memorable for students .to understand concepts and ideas would be the base of learning facts .however , without learning facts , ideas and concepts which students understood are nothing but their knowledge .first , to learn facts is very practical .for instance , when a child was going to touch a very hot kettle .his or her mother would say `` stop !do not touch !it is hot and dangerous  the child might understand the meaning of `` hot  and `` dangerous  as the ida or the concept .he or she might stop their action , although their curiosity would never disappear .we can say the same thing for the students .when they understood concepts and ideas about karate , they would think `` karate is not that difficult .is that true ?when they only understand ideas and concepts in class .they would think that they know everything about that , but that is not true .second , students could learn facts and they would not forget about that .in japan , we have old words about learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts ; hyakubun ha ikken ni shikazu  that means `` when you see it , you will learn everything in no time and never disappear  .for example , the child who were trying to touch the hot kettle , would reach the kettle and got burnt , he or she would never forget about that .on the contrary , after students learn facts , to understand ideas and concepts would be easy for them .when they lost at karate match , they would learn the concepts and ideas about karate very quickly .even when they won , they would understand the concepts and ideas why they wonin conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students .yet , without learning facts , their knowledge can not be practical and memorable .
