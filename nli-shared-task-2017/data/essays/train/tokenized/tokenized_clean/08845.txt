in my opion , i agree that young people exactly enjot life more than older people do .firstly , physical conditions .for the young , they have long lasting energy than the old .so , this objective factor makes the young to endure lots of fun but exciting facilities that old people ca nt not stand .such as : roller coster , pirate ships .in addition to this , the old ca nt experience coloful night life that is most attractive to the young .because of their aging , tensive dancing , alcohol and sound intensity even prohibit them form entering a club !thus , they do nt have power to enjoy exciting life even though they are willing to .secondly , beacuse they are old , they may ragard themselves as a kind of people that have already experienced a lot of things .they will not be interested to enjoy life anymore , what they want is to have a peaceful and quite environment to live for the rest of their life .thus , they may always lie on bed or being alone all the time , without crowd , where should the enjoyment come from ?moreover , they may generate the fear or sorrow feeling of death instead of happiness .so , psychologically , the havelost the ability to enjoy a life !however , the young wo nt consider about the future too much , their attitude would be to `` enjoy life as much as possible , beacuse i m still young and energetic , otherwise , it will be a waste of my awesom energy .so , they hang out with friends , play large varieties of activities crazily .finally , the society merely provides enjoyment to the old .the old once again lose a source of happiness compared to the young .as we all know , there are uncountable clubs , amusement parks , shopping malls as along streets , but none of them are suitable for the old to enjoy .the lack of old people activity sites as infrustructures combines with reasons stated previously create this social factor that contributes the most significant reason for the old ca nt not enjoy life more than young people .this can be also attributes to the notion that people care less about the old than the young .the young are future , the old are remnants .
