did you understang everytime your learend everything ?this subjet is it is more important for students to understang ideas and concepts than it is for learn facts .in my opnion i prefer important for students to understang ideas and concepts .first , do nt worry by not your understanging fot study and understanding .every eachother have each opnion and think so we can not contorl their think and understanding , so we need to say our opnion and we need to know why ?and how ?and understanding .second , we are different , every pepole is different , for example color , language , culture and custom so we ca nt understanding , i have experience , wheh i was came to first visit usa , i do nt know everything , and than i think if i eat good food and i give some food for my friend .i think he like this one , but suddenly hi throwout everything .so i m very surprise .and then he said me our country can not eat pork , i really mistake .so i understanding everyboby is different , and everytime nerver forget and think .futhermore , thinks and behavior , and ues .if you learend something you can use good work , but you can also ues very bad work .for emample , someone theated something , but you can understanding different or mistake , you can use tealent for your bad way .this is very bad and sad .so we need to know good understanding .and thinking about possitive way .
