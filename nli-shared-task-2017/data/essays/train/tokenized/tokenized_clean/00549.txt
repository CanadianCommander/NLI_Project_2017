everyday we are forced to see all kinds of advertisements , from television , from radio and even from our post letters .it gives us millions of information , and definately we are influenced by the advertisements more or less .however , i have to say that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .from advertisement , people always see the good looking of the products .for example , the advertisement of the famous brand shampoo , let s just call it p. we can see the beautiful long hair of many ladies , shining and falling , it is easier for people believe that if we use the same product , we will have the same kind of hair .as a result , most of us can not have the same beautiful hair as the model .advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are , another reason is that the advertisements only show the good points of the products , they never let you know the bad side of it .for example , there is a advertisement about a vacume cleaner , in the advertisement , you are told that it is powerful , easy to handle , and you are even showed that how clean the room is after it is used , however , after you buy it at home , after you actually try it , you may find that it is too big to handle , and it takes a large space to store .i have a similar experience last winter .after the first month of the winter season , i was unhappy to find the the gas charge was extramely higher than i expected , i noticed from the televison advertisement that there was some kind of heater seemd very good , it was powerful , good looking , and i went to the store and bought it at once .after one days of use , i had to return it to the store because it made a lot of noises .i was not told about the noise peoblem from the advertisements .most advertisements definately make peoducts seem much better than they really are .that is the use of the advertisements .so better check carefully before you purchase something .
