i agree with the statement `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .knowledge is the underlying point here in the statement , enough about a single subject or a substantial amount of many subjects .the main idea , of having a broad knowledge is far more beneficial than to specialize in one specific subject .knowledge has to be something which is diverse , not just about a single field or a subject .it has to be a collection of everything .being in touch or knowing things at a broader level has much more to do in today s competitive world .although we require specialists too , but diversity is what is needed more .in terms of studying subjects , sticking to one field or topic definitely limits one s potentials .whereas studying subjetcs at a broader level adds to a more intellect and a overall study .a person , specializing in a particular field or a subject remains limited to that field itself .therefore , resulting in a kind of ignorance of the other fields or the subjects around .in contrast , a broad study of different subjects keeps a finger on every field around .for example : a person studying physics or specialising in this particular subject , will remain very centered around the subject alone .going thorough with the subject , even in physics the person will needs to have some knowledge about an another subject , say , ` mathematics  during his study .so in such a case , he/she will have to seek some other individual s help .in other words the person is not fully equipped with all , he needs to complete his work .had the person have had studied different subjects , it would have been fare more easier .a person who has a broad knowledge of various subjects ( physics and maths too ) , is capable enough of solving things by himself/herself and also at a much broader and higher level .and moreover having a broad knowledge increases a person s over all grip on diverse fields and areas of study .finally , rather than being immersed in a single field of knowledge , it is more beneficial to have a broad knowledge of different fields .in simple words , as the word ` broaditself implies and suggests in having a more broader vision , understanding , and above all a better practical application of knowledge .
