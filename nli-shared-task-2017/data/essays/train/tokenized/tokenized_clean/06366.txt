is there anyone who is successful through a entire history without challenging to a new things ?i absolutely agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know for some reasons .at first , trying new things means getting new chances .secondly , if they fail , they can learn something that other people never know by their experience .the first reason why i believe successful people try new things and take risks is about chances and possibility of being successful .if people just do what they know how to do , that means they will have no chance to learn new things and achieve new goals .speaking of business , nowadays if someone wants to start his/her own business , she/he will contemplate about the field that other people does nt try yet or is not varified enogh about the success .trying new things somewhat means seizing an opportunity .it s clear to take high risks in a new fields but once that business get a right way , it also can get much more success .the higher risks are , the bigger success will be .if there is a someone who just follows the familliay way , it would be safer and esier but success , the result , would be limited in return .the other reason why i think being successful requires to try new things and take risks is learning new things .in a challenge , there is a lot of possibility to fail .however , people can learn lessons or new knowledge from that failure .this experience is never exchangable with anything .it also can be a sturdy foundation of their next step .most successful people got through the severe failures but they never kneeled down to that bitter experience .if people could get over it and learn something , they would be successful with it .
