in the modern world that we know , a lot of different products are available .are we always aware carefully about all those products ?should it be the responsibility of companies to make sure customers know everything about risk that could create by using their products ?in fact , the law wants that all risk concerning a product be identified by the producer .some believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .personnally , i do nt agree with this .those advertisements make you think twice , and at least , they make sure the customer is aware about risks .first , those advertisements make you thing twice before to buy a product like alcool are tabaco .also , usully those argument are pretty stronght and they make yourself considere it a little bit more before using it .also , i have seen on pack of cigarettes , in canada , photograph which are illustrating desease that can be caused by tabaco .this is ugly , that freak you out the first time you see it .this wo nt make a product more attractive for customers .second , at least it informes about some risks that customers may not know concerning the product itself .it could be hard to believe for some people , but it may happen to anybody to use a product and do nt be aware about the effect .if somebody have nt told you or teached you , how can you be aware ?company must be responsible about what they are offering to the population .finally , i believe that the law is not too stronght concerning advertisements on products .they do nt really make products seem much better than they really are .they make sure that everybody is aware about what they will consumed or used .it avoid all misunderstood and surprises .
