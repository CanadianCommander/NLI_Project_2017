some people think that young people enjoy life more than old people do .i am totally agree with this openion on condition that you are in good health .when we examine the the reasons behind why old people usually can not enjoy life as the youth does , we can find the answers for why the youth enjoys more .the young people are usually in good health and still have many hopes for the future .they usually have less to care about life as they are not still engaged in real life troubles .they can easily spend money for fun and do anything for amusement .personally , i am in good health and i do whatever i want provided that i have enough money .i can go out anytime at nights or stay at friends as i am away from my parents .but as for my father , he comes home every evening for dinners and spends the whole evening at home watching tv .he wakes up early in the morning and works all day .he has to care for anything associated with our family in addition to his occupational responsibilities .at the weekends , he prefers staying at home while we want to go out and do shopping or see a movie .he has no pleasures of life and lives in a very pragmatic way .young people have their own dreams , own hopes and they have expectations from life .they think , things are more entertaining when you are young than when you are old .in addition to these , young people are not experienced about life and its pleasures .they can not think of possible results of temporary enjoyments .the old are more careful about life and always thinks twice before doing something .therefore , old people usually miss their past irresponsible happy days when compared being ill and troubled at home .besides , young people like seizeing the day , my personal concern is that anyday repeats itself , so whatever i do today is a gain not a pain for me .noone knows what the future brings .life is meaningful when you are young .the older you get , the less happier you are .
