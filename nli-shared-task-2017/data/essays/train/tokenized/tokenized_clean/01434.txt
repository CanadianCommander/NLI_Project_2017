i completely agree with this statement .there is no doubt that the advertisements do make a product look much better that they actually are .we should understand that the adverstisements are aired to make consumers familiar of a product and to promote its sale .if a company has launched a product it has to have maximum sale in order to have profits .so , they try to attract the attention of the comsumers by projecting it as the best product available in the market .every company advertises its product as a super product as if no other product would ever be able to beat their product in terms of quality and price effectiveness .i feel that they try to fool innocent people for their own intrests .these days , companies project the researches about the products .they just project the good qualities of the product and hide the negative ones to mislead people .for example , they wiill air that the studies have established that their product is better that the product a , b , c and d in x , y , z parameters but they will hide the other parameters the product is not good in .i feel that a good quality product does not need any fancy advertisement , its quality speaks for itself and such a product will become popular with population just by word of mouth .according to my feelings , making a decsion to buy a product just because it is advertised as a very good product is utter foolishness and a waste of money .i , myself have been a victim of fancy advertisements .but , i learnt my lesson of not going by advertisements by incurring heavy monetary losses .i now feel that it is resposibility of individuals to protect themselves from falling into the trap that companies lay to extract money from consumers by advertising .
