people have to choose a major before entering in a college .there are specialized majors such as for example engineering , languagues , litterature , etc . ..but we are able to choose a study which taught many academic subjects .is it better to have a broad knowledge rather than having a specialization in one topic ?on the first hand , i will talk about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i think it is very important to have a large knowledge of many academic subjects .for instance , when i talk to a friend , if he told me a lot of informations about several subjects , i would find he is very smart .having a broad knowledge of many academic subject proves people thqt we have a huge culture , and it is useful when there is a discussion about a topic .indeed , if we had a broad knowledge , we would be able to talk about everything !however , there is a drawback .we just have the main points of every subjects , we wo nt be able to talk about everything of a subject .that s why i think that it is better to study several subjects , such as for example maths , biology or litterature , when we are at high school and not at the university .indeed , pupils have to try every subject in order to find which way they can take after the high school .high school helps us a lot in finding the perfect major we want to study in a university .on the other hand , people are able to choose and to specialize in one specific subject .i think it is better to make this choice because it is useful in order to find a job in the future .for instance , i would like to work as a flight controller in the european space agency ( esa ) .that is why i have to specialize myself in one specific subject : aerospace engineering .if i chose to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , i would have an enormous culture but i would nt be able to find a particular job .to sum up my opinion , i do nt agree with the statement .i think we should specialize in one specific subject in order to find the job we want to have in the future .
