everyone works for an aim , this aim is called success or becoming successful .we all want , try and work for it .have you ever thought of the first and the best comman qualification of successful people ?i thought and share with you : always try new things , be creative and have self-confidence to take risks .when you look around you will see the most successful ones are the ones who take the radical ideas and do not worry to give life to them .first ; the old needings of human are the best reason for new things .if you do not worry about if it will be liked by everyone you will become a great candidate for a successful people .for example when the television first invented nobody thougt it would spread so rapidly but the inventors belived and now we see what happened clearly .secondly , new things mean creativity and i belive you do not need anything in your entire life if you had creativity .creative people always achive success , near or far one day they see its helps .for example in the tv competition called survivor : it is a coompetiton about human against nature : there is an island and men with nothing .the competitors are similar in their physical conditions but their creativity make the difference .lastly , taking risks .if you do not worry about others thoughts and have a selfconfidence there is nothing to stop you to success .in my country there is a man without arms and legs he lost them in a train accident when he was 5 .but now he is one of the greatest swimmers of my country hemaybe compete in olympics soon .he did not mentione the risks can occure when he was swimming .all he has is self-confidence and belief in himself .consequently , i think successful people try new thingns , are creative and has enormous self-confidence to take risks .if you have these qualifications i believe one day you will be very successful too .
