on the one hand , i agree in some ways with the statement saying that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  for specific reasons .first , one ca nt deny that young people are healthy and it makes their every-day-life easier than for older people : less sleeping problems , many outdoors activities offered , etc .then , young people do benefit from an other important advantage : they have time in front of them .indeed , such a situation helps to make plans for one s future .on top of that , young people can benefit from the fact that they do not have children and the responsabilities going with it .furthermore , life for young people often appears as easier and less heavy because of their easygoing way of being and thinking .but , on the other hand , many reasons encourage me to disagree with the discussed statement and say that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people do .indeed , i would first underline the fact that older people often - but not always - have something very precious that youngsters do not have : maturity .and it is to my mind a great help to handle everyday life .there are many things i have done when i was young i wish i could do again with the experience i got since that time .an other thing which also often lack young people : money .for insance , it is quite a heavy situation to be a student , even if adults often forget this and only remind the good sides of their youth .as a conclusion , i would say that enjoying life is not really a matter of age but rather the way one handle with it .it happens that youngsters with maturity , money and health really appreciate life , whereas older people can lack maturity and money .so there is no rule of age and enjoying age , i would rather say it is an every day work on oneself
