i believe this statement is true only in part .youg people nowadays are involved in a variety of activities for their social and cultural development , that it is hard to find time to help the community .schools take away the most part of the day and personal study takes away another big percentage .the rest of the day is used by young people to relax or to have fun .a critic reader might say that these aspects are secondary , but it is not totally true .in a culture where social pressure is so stressed and everybody has to reach high standards , the time used to relax , think , and have fun is foundamental .young peolple of today are more stressed than young people of fifty years ago .i believe this is a basis that is hard to demolish .on the other side it is true that the time a person ( not only a young one ) sacrifices in order to help the comunity is a well spended time .helping the community means , for young people , the possibilty to grow in a wide sense and , in particular , to start testing the world of work .these young people who help their communities are developping those skills that are essential later .there are still thousands and thousands of young people who are hard working for their communities not regarding of money .these people are part of the hidden world that the adults like to forget about when they wrtite their critic speeches about the passitivity of the new generation .i can assure that i know at least 20 boys and girls who everyday take care of the country , the society where they leave without a single world of gratitude by anybody .those are the people of tomorrow , the people who will change the world in order to secure better conditions for the society .
