last week while i was driving to gallarate , a town near the university i attend , i met my granmother , so i stopped and asked her were she was going .surprisingly she said that she was going to an elderly house in order to help the volunteers that worked there .i have to admit that i strongly felt guilty > i was going to a shopping mall to do some shopping !thus , you can understand that i surely agree with this statement .personally i think that nowadays young people * like me ( don-t spend enought time helping thier communities .there are many reasons for this behavior .first i-m afraid that young people aren-t surely as generous as they ancestors .they are much more committed to thier own interests and necessity so they don-t see the needings of other people .what-s more they are not used to living away from their family and grandparents so they don-t understand how important is for elderly people to spend some time with the youngest , just listening to their problems and love stories .furthermore they usually stay at university campuses all the day/long , they don-t go off until the evening so they don-t even know what the problems of the community off the campus can be or where they can work as volunteers .this fact must not be entirely seen as a lack of young people .the work that must be done to receive high grades is very hard .students don-t have only to attend the lessons , but they must review the notes taken in class , meet other students in order to compare these notes , do group researches in the laboratories . ..thus , very short time remaind for them and during these free times they probably want to enjoy theirselves .so , even if it is true that young people don-t spend enought time helping their communities , in my point of view it is not completely they fault .thus , you can understand why last week i actually went to the shopping mall .but you can also understand why i phoned my granmother later and asked her if she needs some help at the elderly house .
