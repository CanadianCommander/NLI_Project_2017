probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today and this will be due to different reasons .in fact there are already many problems for the traffic end for polluted air and it  s easy that it will be something to resolv this problem .there will be many more pubblic way to go aroun than today .modern cars need petrol wich is not an infinite source and it s easy to think that there will be different kinds of works so that people will not need a car as much as today .first a modern problem are the poluted air and the traffic , wich is too caotic .so it  s easy to think that scientists are trying to resolve these problem .a possible solution is to make something to have cars that will not have such a bad effect to the air as it is today .but to resolve both the problem of traffic and air there will be many more buses or trains .in fact today there are so many cars around iven because there are not enough pubblic buses or trains , so it s necessary to have a car to go to work or to every other place .then a big problem of cars is that they need petrol to go on .but petrol is not an infinite source so in the future there will be less petrol than the one necessary for the great number of cars .it means that petrol will cost too much till it will be too expansive for many people , that will decide to use other ways to go around instead of cars .in addition new tecnologhyes are developping new kinds of works , in fact many people will work from their own house using their computers and internet .so they will not need to go to work every day like they usually do now , and they will not need to have many cars in each family to go to work in different place .so the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today will be better for the condition of the air and for ourselves too .and it will be easyer to go around spending less money than today
