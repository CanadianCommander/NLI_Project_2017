from my point of view this statement is only partially true .through my studies in the area of management and entrepreneureship i know that the typical successful entrepreneur is not the crazy person many people think .quite the opposite is actually the case .a successful entrepreneur thinks his ideas and plans through very carefully before acting .even though it is of course true that there is always some risk involved , risk-taking should not be confused with carelessness .more over , i believe that a person who really knows where his or her strength lay , can be very successful .for example , if a person has a passion for and the ability to building guitars , it will probably be best to exploid and build on this ability , rather than try to build many different instruments .specialization is the kye here .so , if someone is good at something and likes what he or she is doing , improving the skills in this area will be more successful that starting to experiment .this of course does not mean that a person , who focuses one his strengths , can stop learning .it only means that the energy for learning new ways and methods should be focused on that one particular area .for the guitar builder , for example , this would mean to every now and then try something new to improve his procedures .he could maybe invent a machine which helps him to be more efficient .thereby he would be would try something new but the risk involved if the machine does not work is limited .another way to try something new without carelessly taking risk is to transfer experience .a person who has gained expertise in a particular area might find a new and different way to use this knowledge .using the same example , the guitar builder could for example begin a cooperation with a violine builder and exchange knowledge .the processes involved are similar but neither of them would have to actually start building the other instrument but both could still profit from the experiences .after all , i would rewrite the satement as follows : successful people try new things but carefully estimate the risk involved .
