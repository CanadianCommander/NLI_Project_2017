in order to be successful , people use methods , in accordance to their personality , problem solving methods , and style of life .throughout history , we see people who became successful by simply doing what is done before , or taking the way no one have taken before .to start with , i can say that majority of people try to be successful with using already established methods .some have the results which are supposed to be had , some even fails to apply a method , and some had extraordinary results due to various reasons .as an example , i can say that sir alex ferguson , scottish manager of manchester united football team , is one of the most success people that i have ever seen during my life .he is having his twentieth season as the manager of the club , and he not only had several achievements as a manager , but also honored by the queen by being given the honorific `` sir  .i can also state that he is having the same type of managing since the first day as a manager , and never gave exceptations from his rules , his tactics and his managing style .we all witnessed his fights with his squad s star players , like david beckham and ruud van nistelrooy in order not to make any exceptations .he was the same when he used to manage the scottish club , whose name i can not remember at the moment , thus , i can say that he is simply doing what he knows how to do well .on the other hand , there are also people who had success by trying things that were never tried before , andd taking risks .for example , austrian psychologist sigmund freud , who is also called father of psychology by some experts , tried a lot of new things , claimed many new things about the human psychology , and founded the school of `` psychoanalysis  .he added new terms to the literature of psychology like ; id , ego , superego and defense mechanisms .he tried his own methods with his clients , and certainly was very successful at that .there are many theories whics have their basis in psychoanalysis , and many theories were constructed in opposite to pschoanalysis .to summarize , i believe that it is the person that becomes successful , no matter what his  her way is .if he or she has the strength and puts enough effort , there is no reason not to be successful .just have faith in yourself , and and you are half way away to being successful .
