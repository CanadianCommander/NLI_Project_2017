the process of learning in a school environment is very complicated and involves that a student will nead to acquire many habilities , such as understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts .i believe that even if both habilities are important , understanding ideas and concepts is more essential for a student than learning facts .understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students because it will give them methods to approach problems in other academic fileds , in the day to day life , as well as in a professionnal career once they will start one .when we talk about understanding ideas and concepts , we talk about an important learning process going on .for example , when you understand the concept of the prisoner s dillemma once in your life , you will not forget it , because it is not purely factual , your brain has to connect concepts and ideas together in order to understand it .moreover , you will be able to use this concept in other situations , to understand what is going on in a situation where the conditions of the prisoner s dillema are met .on the other hand , learning facts , even if it has some importance in the learning process of a student , seams to me something highly mechanical .memory is not perfect , and most of the facts that we learn will be forgotten at one point or another in our life anyways .however , if you forget the date when the second world war started , or the scientific name of a bug , you can always look in a book or in a dictionary to refresh your memory .but is knowing the date when the second world war started ( a fact ) that important compared to knowing what the second world war is , what kind of issues where at sake , why germany wanted to invade other countries , etc. ( concepts and ideas ) anyways ?i believe it is not .understanding concepts and ideas is much more valuable in my opinion than simply learning facts , because it allows you to understand the meaning of something , to make your own opinion about it , and to articulate it in order to convince others that your rigth .in conclusion , even if students needs to learn facts in order to acquire a good education , more attention should be given to understanding ideas and concepts .
