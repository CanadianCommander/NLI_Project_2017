in china , my home country , when we talk about enjoy in the past , we think of getting rid of poverty and wars .but in this more and more competitive society , even the new challeging and new experience of this world are no longer appearling as some old people may think , when compared to the high pressure we young adults received .all the pressure : competition with classmates , competition with colleagues , and high pressure of taking care of a new family .competition in schools-from elementary school all the way to graduate level , now is heavy like no other period .everyone around seems like genius .and even worse , the parents realise it .the kids as aerly as only 3 or 4 years old , many are forced to go to take courses on piano , maths or professional athelet .they live in the competition and do nt have the chance to play with the other kids , or to spend a whole weekend afternoon in the playground .it actually has caused a lot of psychological problem of those kids .for a deploma from a prestige college , many kids ca nt stand the high standard from the teachers and parents and commit suicide .in my opinion , it wo nt be a life enjoyble for these students .the recent time that i know the deadly competition for empolyment , is when talking to a 82 years old granny i met in a local park .she told me she was very satisfied with her life now .but the only thing she keep concering of is the work of her children .one of them have a undergraduate degree , but can not get a work with $ 60 usd a month .the insurance is problem , the house rent is a problem , even the food becomes a main concern .this probelm is facing many young adults , especially those who just go into the professional area .teenage mom is no longer news , and it thoroughly reflect a social problem when solving the family issue of young adults .most high school dropouts , if it s not for the study problem , it s the teenage moms .they give birth to a new life , but also sacrifice their life to receive better education and better occupation .another feature odf modern society , is the age of newly marriage couple are getting older and older .everybody seems lost in the work , and rarely have time or energy to face the marriage and commitment .many guys in their 30s , do nt know anything about women , is no longer somthing rare , too .when facing these big issues in life , young adults seem have very fragile feelings , and most of them are not happy with them .as a result , young people are a social group experiencing high pressure from all aspects .their lives are not enjoyble .
