some people thinks that the way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is not good .however , i fully agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .first , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .for example , when i was a junior at waseda university , a famous private university in tokyo , japan , i joined the tour to french for ten days with tanada kota , my best friends at the same class , in 1990 .it was the first time for me to go to abroad and i could not speak french language .during the stay in paris , i caught a bad cold and fever .mr. suzuki , a tour gide , was a kind man , had a heart of gold , and spoke french nicely .mr. suzuki took me to the hospital .thanks to mr. suzuki , i could cure my disease and came back to japan .as the above experience shows that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .second , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun than travel alone or without tour guide .for example , when i was a junior at chuo high school , located north of tokyo , i joined the tour to kyoto , a traditional area in japan , with my friends of the swimming club .the tour guide named hitomi was so humoras and beautiful lady .so , we took many pictures with hitomi .that was a nice memory for us even today .last sunday , i ran into tomohisa kamimura , a member of that kyoto tour , at the tokyo station .we went to a bar and talk about our memory about ms. hitomi for three hours with a lot of whisky .it was great night for me .as the above example demonstrates , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more convenient than travel alone or without tour guide .in conculusion , i definitely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
