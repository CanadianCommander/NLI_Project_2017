the first thing that comes into the mind is that people are simply unconscious about the topic of pollution and environmental problems .what they really care is their comfort .everybody wants to live in comfort , isnt it ?but they dont think about how much time their comfort will last .the answer should not say a long period of time because it is this comfort that will end the life on earth .everyday , the population of earth increases with acceleration , so , proportional to the number of peaople we can say that the number of cars will certainly increase .if we are to think of ay decrease in this number , we should considers about peoples consciousness as individulas and governments regulations .first of all , the cars release outside , to the air , very hazardous gases which cause to ozon depletion .the people outside dont really know what the ozon deplation is .moreover , the old cars that are not used anymore are themselves are the cause of the pollution becouse , the huge metal waste is also thrown into the earth .so , at this point , scintists have the real job .they should make both the individuals and the governments beware of this dangerous issue .secondly , there is also a conflict here that increase in the number of cars makes themselves useless !there is a lot of traffic in big cities already and this will increase day by day .at the end all the cars will be totally useless .it will be that time that people will begin to think about using buses and railways .but , i dont think this will happen in a couple of decades .finally , with the advances in technology , there may be flying objects that can supply the transport in the cities so that people will no longer need the cars .but for this technology to be reached , maybe it will take a whole century .to sum up , i think in the next two decades there will bw even more increase in the number of cars simply because of the incresase in human population .it will take much more time for people become conscious about environmental problems .but in the end nature will adjust itself
