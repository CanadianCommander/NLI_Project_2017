agree or disagree ? !when i first read this statement i thought it s hard for me to choose if i agree or disagree with the following statement .after thinking for few minutes , i now know an answer !i agree and disagree at the same time !i think its good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and at the same time , i think that specializing in a a certain subject is perfect too !both conditions have advantages .one of the advantages of having broad knowledge in more than one subject is that this knowledge can help you alot in understanding what people say .for example , if you are a person who has a broad knowledge in various academic subjects , you will somehow understand a program that talk about politics !but if you were a person that specialized in one specific subject and that subject , for example was astronomy , it ll be hard for you to understand a political program !an advantage for a person that has knowledge in only a specific subject is that this person will have deep information in the subject that they studied .for example , a person who specialized in business will have good information and detailed information in this subject .in contrast , a person that is not specialized in a specific subject will not know detailed information in a subject like business for example .there are more advantages and disadvantages for both conditions but i just wanted to state these that i actually can think of for now .i think that it would be perfect if a person has broad knowledge of various academic subjects as a well as specializing in a certain subject too , but who will actually do that ? !as for me , i really want to but it s hard !!
