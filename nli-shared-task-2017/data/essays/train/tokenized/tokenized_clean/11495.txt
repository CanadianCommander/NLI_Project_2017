nowadays , people start worrying about the future of the car .the car is an everyday necessity for most people in our developed countries but it also raises many issues such as pollution and urban mobility .i think that within twenty years , there will be fewer cars for these two issues will have been adressed .urban mobility is a major subject for all big cities all over the world .if you want to keep a city attractive for investors , workers , tourists and inhabitants , people have to be able to move , and what s more , to move fast .of course , to make it possible , there s a need for space .the issue at state is obviously economical .traffic jams are a sign of a lack of space and above all the need to launch great urbanisation policies .a few years ago , london decided to instaure a fee for cars who wanted to circulate in the inner city .paris , is launching a great campaign to encourage people to take public transportation instead of their own cars .i reckon that efficient public transportation is the key success to an attractive city .cars are no longer the future of cities and for this reason there will be fewer and fewer cars within two decades .but the most preoccupying problem caused by cars is pollution .indeed , cars are responsible for a large part of environmental problems such as the pollution of air .even though , cars are used everywhere in developed countires , they are concentrated in small urban centers , which makes it all the more concerning .in cities , the density of cars and the traffic jams make pollution a real preoccupation .despite the urban mobility policies , the development of alternative technologies can also help to reduce pollution .but , for these new technologies are expensive , i think people will prefer public transportation to these new cars .over all , there will be fewer cars because they cause too many problems .in conclusion , i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars because urban mobility will become a field of economic competition between big cities and that environment concerns will be taken seriously .
