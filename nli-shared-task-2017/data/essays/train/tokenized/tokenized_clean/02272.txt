what is it to be successful ?it sometimes seems to be unusual , or not normal .when reading bibliographies of successful people , they do unusual thigs .they are described as a stupid , annoying , breave but strange human-being .editson was kicked out of the school because he kept asking a teacher why 1 plus 1 is equl to 2 .soldiers went to war even though they could actually see that the death was waiting for them .is it true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know ?does it mean that it is necesssary to have new points of view , try new things and take risks to be successful ?assume that an apple suddenly falls on someone s head .what would that person say out right away ?if it were me , i would say ` ouch !  but newton said ` why did it fall ?here is a significant differences between him and other people .newton wondered why the apple falls to the ground , not floating on the air , while everyone had already accepted it as a natural incident .as soon as he became curious and wondering , he started studying on it .that is what most scientist or inventors usually start their scientifical work .look at king .martin luther .he is very well-known black person who had been arguing about black people s freedom and right .he must have had suffered a lot of risks while he was arguing his opinion .not that he was the only one who was upset about white people s unfairness .black people were also as upset as him , but none of them were as brave as him .he is now very famous , historical , heorical person in the history of the world .lastly , soldiers in all kinds of wars .many people took the risks to die in the war , get tortured by enemy , and lose their family .they surely and obviously knew how much risky way they chose to follow .but they did not deny it .they followed it as if it was what they must have done .historical , famous , well-know , and greatly successful people take risks as if that is what they were born to do .they think differently .they are always willing to try and do new things rather than following what other people have thought or believed in .
