there are a variety of people in the world that has different professions .between them , there are successful and unsuccessful people using their talent .in my opinion , what makes this difference is that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing that they already know how to do well , when the unsuccessful people do nt .three reasons will support this idea ; by taking risks , they will grow respect to others , understand fear of going out from the comfort zone , and experience different worlds that would make his or her own profession improve .firstly , people should know how to respect other people for living in a society .if you could nt understand , or at least try to understand what other people are saying , you could not observe important opinions that might help your talent improve .what is true in every successful people are , that they observe people s ideas , see if it is valuable for him or herself , and make it their own advantage .secondly , people grow more mature when they know how it feels to lose .understanding and experiencing the fear to step outside from your comfort zone , and explore the outer world and other people s point of views , makes you more thoughtful .if they happen to know only themselves and his or her sorroundings , they would have an extemely short-sighted and stubborn point of view .they will be overly-confident and proud about themselves and this will definately not help the person to succeed in their profession .thirdly , exposure to an area that you have nt experienced before would be very efficient for the person s own growth as a human being .risking yourselves and trying something new , or observing new information and reflecting it to your own activity , puts spice to your professions that results in an evolution of your talent .in conclusion , by risking your own property and experiencing the world you do not know , makes the person more of a kind and respectful , intelligent man or a woman .therefore , i think that it is beneficial to take risks rather than staying in their comfort zone .
