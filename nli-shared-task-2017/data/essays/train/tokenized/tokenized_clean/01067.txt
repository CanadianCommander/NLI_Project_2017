when we talk about traveling a lot of things comes to our mind like prices , places to visit , time to expend in such place and if is good to be led by a tour guide or not .i think the best way to travel is by oneself , without a tour guide .there are many reasons that support my idea .for example oneself could visit other places not offered in the tour , design their own schedule , and skip non interesting places .in a tour the guide take their group of tourists to an especific place , already planned by the travel agency .in contrast , without a tour guide oneself could go wherever he/she want .for instance , i traveled to toronto and i found interesting travel to places by myself .i had the chance to talk to people from the city and ask them the best places to visit from their point of view , they know better than tour guides .in a planned tour , the tourist have an schedule to follow .i prefer to plan my own schedule , according to my interest and necesities .for example , what if i want to go and relax all day on the beach .if i have the chance to elaborate my schedule .i can adjust my plans to visit other places in order to get what i want .finally , some tour agencies have tour plans to visit places that are important to certain type of people .i went to visit florida for my vacations and i had bad luck because i traveled with a group of old people .they were not interested in visit places like busch gardens or exiting theme parks like universal studios .they just wanted to stay at the beach , or go to quiet places .if i would traveled by myself without a tour guide , i would visited theme parks with those exiting roller coaster , or visited beaches full of young women .in general , i consider a better option to travel without a tour guide .the experience is more exiting and suit to oneself interest .therefore , oneself could visit places interesting for the person instead of places interesting for the tour agency , create their own schedule and skip `` boring  places to other more interesting .
