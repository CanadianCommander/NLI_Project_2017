i have a father who works very hard .he is a manager of a group of japanese people at a company called hitachi .sometimes my father works so hard that he works at his company until the next morning .i feel bad for him sometimes .one day , i asked him about how he managed to do all the hard work .in japanese , he said that he enjoys the work that he does and he said that the work that he does is very hard work , but he feels rewarded when he finishes the work because he gets a bonus when he does an extra hard work .i work very hard too .i go to a very demanding american school with high standards .i work hard to keep up my grades in my ap environmental science , ap calculus and ap statistics classes .during the time off when i have free time , i work on my homework .during the weekend , i work on my homework .i am under a lot of stress and pressure .i turned my college applications in last week .i am worried that i might not get accepted into the colleges that i intend to get in .fyi , the colleges that i applied to last week was in america .my parents also gave me an option to apply to japanese universities but i can not apply to them until i get the result from the american universities because the year starts different for american and japanese universities .to be honest , i do not know which country to go to .in addition , i have a choice of rejecting the university in america and instead apply to a university in japan or i can go to a university in america .either way , i do not know which country to choose between japan and america .the universities in america that i applied to will give me the results of whether i am a good candidate or not in april .moreover i have three months until i can decide whether i will go to america or not , but i have not a clue about which country to choose because i love both countries .( i can not stay in england because of financial problems )considering that young people are people younger than a college student like me and older people are people who are older than a high school senior , i think older people enjoy life more than young people .young people are under enormous pressure because of the issue with the university and the future after that .on the other hand , older people do not have to endure with that pressure because they have already gone over that obstacle .
