it often happens in schools and colleges that students do not understand some topic and so cram it up and often forget it during the exam time .i believe it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .ofcourse it is sometimes much easier to just learn pre-stated ideas or established facts then to do reseach on a topic .take for example , einstein s equation of mass and enegy relation : e = m ( c ) 2 .we might just want to learn it as it is in school , rather than try to prove it like einstien did , because we neither have the time nor the intelligence to prove it at that level .however lack of time or `` einstein s brain  is no excuse to just learn every fact as it is .it is easier to remember information if we try to understand the concept involved in that particular phenomenon .for example , teaching a 5th grade student that `` sun rises in the east  is okay , but the student should also understand that it rises in the east because earth rotates from west to east in an anti-clockwise manner .when a person tries to understand the ideas and concepts , he questions common beliefs and tries to find answers to questions that pop into his mind thus strengthening his inquisitiveness and improving his knowledge .understanding a topic , makes it more interesting and make learning easier .it also makes recalling an idea during exams easier .other than just improving one s own knowledge , while trying to understand ideas by questioning the common beliefs , one might even make new discoveries .it might make a person curious about a topic or a phenomenon .besides , craming makes studying boring and monotonous .it reduces our concentration level and thus reduces our efficiency .thus it is always better to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts .
