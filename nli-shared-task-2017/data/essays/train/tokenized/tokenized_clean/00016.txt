i agree to the statement proposed .in my view it is very important that one shoould undersatnd the ideas and concepts before they sit down to learn the facts .i would like to support this statement by giving a personal example .i am a student studying in the 12th grade .today the concepts and facts that i need to learn are not very easy .definately , a lot of hard work goes into learning them !but , if i sit down and understand why and what i am doing. , then it definately makes it much simpler for me to go through an entire chapter .i think this is the case with many of my friends too .i would also like to put down the fact that i am a student who has shifted from the normal c.b.s.e an indian borad to the international baccalaureate because of one simple reason .at my earlier school the standard norm was that of rote-learning .we would just have to mug up the entire text book and regurgirate it on our exam papers . .but my current school helps us understand what we are doing .they make us do activities and give us explanantions on what we are going to do and why .this really helps me and my peers to learn faster .so , i very strongly believe that what ever we do has to have a great deal of understandingbehindit , before we jump in to learn the facts .we should always ask ourselves a set of standard questions before we jump into a task or start learning facts that we dont undersatnd or we dont have the basic knowledge about .most importantly , why ?why is it that iam doing this ?what ?what is it that i am doin ?what am i going to gain out of this ?where ?where is it going to leed me ?i think by answering these questions we make a very good and learned individual .we do understand and definately , learn better !!
