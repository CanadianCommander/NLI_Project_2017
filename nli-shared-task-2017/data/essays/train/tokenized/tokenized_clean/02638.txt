some people believe that having a broad knowledge in various academical subjects may lead them to greater depths in their carreer .on the other hand , there are also many examples of people concentrating on a single subject and specialize and make a carreer with it .in my opinion , studying for a specified subject would be a more efficient and wiser decision to make .for example , when you think yourself as a student who is having double major on two unrelated fields , you ll soon mix together what you have studied .the two essentials of the two fields would be congested .by the end of your study , you ll not be able to specialize in either of the subjects .you ll just be able know the basics of them which is not the best thing the succeed in life .a further example of why choosing a single subject can be the attempting of a working carreer of your own in a certain field .for this to happen , you need to concentrate on a single subject at your academic career since you have to understand your subject with detail and from every point of view .this only occurs with specialization .therefore  being ambitious in life , brings the need to specialize in a specified subject .if we look at the problem from a student point of view , some students believe that broad knowledge on many subjects requires lots of time and a lot of sacrifice from social life .by this drawback , they easily select specializing in one subject .this could also be seen as a different reason of choosing a single subject to study .as we have seen from the examples , it does nt matter whether you are ambitious on specializing on a specified subject .the important thing is that , it is the wiser decision to take to reach what you are aiming in life .these aims can be listed as succeeding in working life , achieving on new discoveries of your subject , specializing on what you studied or even being able to spare time at your university years .for sake of your aims , it is better to have a knowledge on specifis subject .
