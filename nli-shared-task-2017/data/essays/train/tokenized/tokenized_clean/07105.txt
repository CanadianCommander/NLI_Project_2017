since beginning of my prep-school education , our teachers tried to teach every thing from different areas , for example we had math course , music course and also a drawing course .this situation continued until the the university education begins .for the first time , in the university we started to specialize our knowledge to specific areas .for a person s academic plan we can think by this way .however , when you start your academic life you can specialize for only one subject or try to get information from different subjects .i think specializing is more effective way for all the period of education .the first reason is , if you specialize in one specific subject and if you accomplish this successfully , you will become an autherity for this subject and you can answer all questions about this subject .however , if imagine the other choice , trying to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will never say i performed successfully , because nowadays technology is exponentially growing and the information about all the subjects are developing , i want to say that todays knowledge can be uselles for today .because of these reasons , folowing the technology and updated information will be impossible if you want to have knowledge from different subjects .another important issue for specilazing one specific subject is , the academicans  first task is investigate new things and gather new information and then share them with the public .investigating is a very difficult task and if you want to find new things for a subject and also develop it , you should know everythin about the subject until now .you must define all the details of the subject and only by this way you can make investigations .specializing is became very important for this approach because it is impossible for a person to know every thing about subjects from different areas .as a conclusuon , specializing is much better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .also , in my belief that , we start specilaizing from the high-schools or earlier .we should define people s abilities and draw a direction for their future life .by this way we can create expert academicans for their subject
