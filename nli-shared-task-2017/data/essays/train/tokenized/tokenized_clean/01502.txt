some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way .but , a group tour normally has its strict schedule and does not offer the tourists in group any chance to meet many people in new place .so , i strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .first , a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it .and it means that i can not choose the place where i want go and the food which i want to eat .for example , when i went to thailand for the first time , i chose a group tour because i was young and it was the first time to go abroad .i really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in bangkok , but i could nt go there because i was in a group tour and i had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered .and i had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening , even though i wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night .it was really bad experience .second , a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members .becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus , it is difficult to meet many people in new places .but if i travel alone , i can meet many people and feel their cultures .when i went to tokyo by myself , i met really many people there .i could talk with them and some of them became my friends !even though i could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour , choosing a place where i go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and japanese people were kind to let me know the ways .all things considered , i definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all .by going new place alone , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there .
