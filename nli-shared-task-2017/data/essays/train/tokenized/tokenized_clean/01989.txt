i agree with that statement .there are several reasons for young people not to take actively part in their community .the main point is the missing education of children and young people .today many of them are nt well educated in behaviour .families do nt spend enought time to affect the children s behaviour , because they think it is the teacher in school who has to do that , but he is nt .a familie has to provide social rules to it s young members to make them known in the importance of relationships and communitive life .to me , religion also plays a role in this education .many young people are nt religious for several reasons , but religion can have an important effect on the peoples communitive thinking .it teaches equality and understanding and it tells that every single person is important and a good relation between each other is one of the most important thing in life .most of my friends who are members of the christian church are highly interested in our community and participate actively .another reason for the missing helping is the influence of mass media on the teenagers .advertising implies that everyone is only next to hisself , no one else matters and it finally suggests that one is the middle of the universe .young people who have nt a working familiar background , are left alone with that suggestions .it is no surprise that they ca nt cope with the influences and that results in missing interests of the community they life in .so as i mentioned in the beginning the main thing is education in the familiar background to increase the number of actively working young people within communities .
