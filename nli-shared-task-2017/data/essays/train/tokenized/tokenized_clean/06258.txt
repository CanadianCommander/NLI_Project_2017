in my opinion is impossible to theoretically define whether it is better to manage several academic subjects or to go more in depth with just one subject .indeed , it really depends on the field you will apply this academic knowledge to .i think i m in an ideal position to give some examples of different situations to which the two different approaches apply .so far , in fact , i had two very different working experiences , the first one as a controller in a multinational company and the second ( and current ) one as a management consultant .on the one hand , during my first work experience as a controller i had to get a deep understanding of all the accounting principles that regulated the activities of the finance department of my company .it was a really tough experience because i had to get familiar with a lot of very specific and technical subjects since otherwise the quality of my work might have been affected .i had to develop a very good memory to remember all the details typical of this kind of field .on the other hand , during my current work experience as a management consultant i need to be more flexible than spcialized , so that now i m familiar with a huge variety of subjects .i work , in fact , in several different industries - such as automotive , consumer goods and banking - and in very different companies  functions - like for instance marketing , human resources and finance .given that i usually work on very short projects , i always need to get familiar with the context of a project in a short period of time , which means that i need to have at least a generic background on that particular field .this usually allows me to work on the project without necessarly getting a very deep understanding of how the related inustry/functions works .to conclude , i would say that i generally prefer dealing with many different subjects rather than specializing myself .nevertheless i think , as my working experience shows , that there always could be situations where you also need to get a specialistic knowledge .
