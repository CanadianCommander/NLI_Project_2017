all people enjoy life , and they show this by participating in many of life s amazing activities .people enjoy life in many forms .yet , people do not lose this thirst for life as they grow older .the things people enjoy might change with time , but this does not mean that they derive less enjoyment from them .improvements in healthcare have made old people s lives easier and they have also increased their mobility , allowing them to pursue many activities during their retirement .people enjoy life regardless of age , and this dismisses the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people  .of course there are differences between the young and the old .the young are typically more active and less patient .yet , this does not imply that they enjoy life more .this merely implies that young people have a different set of preferences , and different ideas as to what constitutes as fun .consequently , they enjoy different activities .many young boys enjoy playing football with their friends .playing football can be quite demanding physically .rarely , do we see senior citizens playing football .instead , we might see them strolling in a park , or watching their favorite tv show .these activities are less demanding physically , but old people do not enjoy them less .as medicine and technology have improved , life expectancy has increased .today people live much longer than they used to .people spend many years in their retirement , and many find these years to be the most enjoying years of their life .people , who are in their retirement , have the time to do what they please .they do not have meetings and scheduals to meet , and this allows them to live life at a slower pace .this also allows them to go on long trips and holidays , and see the places they wished to see during their youth .also due to improvements in heathcare , old people are not are immobile as they once were .this allows many old people to continue to fuction normally , and even play sports like golf .the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people  is false , because of the many points that speak against it .old people enjoy life no less than young people .true they enjoy different things , but this is due to the fact that they have different preferences and needs .
