i completely agree with the statement that at present young people do not spend time to help the community they live in .one reason for this is the change in individuals attitude towards community problems .nowadays , people are too much selfish and focused on their own individual needs to be able to realize that there is the opportunity and sometimes the real need that their efforts and time are also employed in something which helps the community growing and living .this problem affects also young people .forn instance they spend more time in playing videogames and watching television , thinking about their own satisfaction , and they do not go outside the walls of their houses to understand the problems of the world surrounding them .in addition , there is a problem connected with the lack of common values .due to the fact that at present most of the time the communities the young people live in are multicultural and it is likely that within the same community members do not share the same values ( such as religious , ethical , political values ) , it is often difficult for young people to find out which are the needs of the community .further , i think another problem is in the lack of curiosity .young people at present are less curious then in the past .this is due to the fact that it easier for them to access information , get answers and satisfy their needs : they do not make many efforts to solve problems and find answers to the question the surrounding world poses .this affects their ability to understand the problems of the communities they live in and find a solution for them .in other words , they do not help their communities because thay are not able to help them .in conclusion , it would be opportune that , starting from the primary schools , teachers and parents teach young people how to understand reality and
