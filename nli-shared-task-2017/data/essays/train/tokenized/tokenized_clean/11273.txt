in the old time , people belong to the community .when they lived in the villege or town , everyone knew each other .but , pepole move to cities nowaday so that their life styles change .in my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping thier communities because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintance in the community .first of all , young persons have to study hard so they can not have a abundant time to take part in the community activities .recently many people go to highschool or university .comparing for one hundred years ago , they must study much more time .if they do no go to higher education schools , they afford to participate comunity activities .however , they do not have a time so they can not help them .second , young generations interested in playing than hepling communities .for example , playing sport , music , and dance fascinates them .they feel communities meeting are boring and not exciting .moreover , nowadays many young person are looking for more interesting events .they think communities are not important so refusing attendance .finally , city life changes the community ideals .as usual many people move from rural to urban place so they do not know each other .if you do not have a relationship around your house , nobody join the community .in addition , city life has a bad human relationship .they are not interested in one another .in the conclusion , modern civilization afffected the social relation as well as technology development .young generation would change a lot of aspects .they got a variety of possibilities .thus young people do not need to help their communities because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintances in the community .therefore i do t agree the statement .
