knowledge about different subjects are important in this fast and devoloping world .one should have knowledge of many topics to survive .i agree with the fact that the broad knowledge of many different academic subject is better than in one subject .to begin with , i would like to draw attenton towards the fact that less knowledge less opportunities .a person with broad kwowledge of different subjects can perform well in any field .many fields are open for the person at the same time .but person who has done specialization in any single subject will not be able do anything out of his field . .secondly , people with broad knoledgee leads to great achievement in life .for example if a person from engineering feild enters into management of any big company and manages it well .he will be promoted faster than a employee who is specialized only in engineering .another example if a students keeps on reading course books and scores well in each semester without good knowledge of computer .he will face big problem in performing any job as computer has become a great need of the people nowadays .thirdly , if the person has knowledge ogf many streams , he can change his main stream whenever he want .he might face difficulties in performing good in his stear and so ca n changer field whenever it is required .for example if person have taken both medical and non medical subjects in junior colleges .he or she always has chance to shift in the field in which he or she is performing well .in conclusion i would only say that knowledge about the different fields is always a positive things
