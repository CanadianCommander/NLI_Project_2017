i think it is better to specialize in one specific subjet rather then having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .so i disagree with this statement , and thats becauce of two reasons .first , i think that if you choose one subject , or one major to study and specialize in , it will be more comfortable to do your best and achive your goals .for example , my father studied finance and law in the university , and he really worked hard to specialize in the two subject , and after he graduated he relized that it is too hard so he could nt do it and he worked as a finance officer and never benifit of his other subject .the second reason is that you will be mixed up with all the many subjects that you are studing and you will not be able to enjoy your .i always ask my self , why people do it ?because you have to work hard and kill yourself to specialize in many subjects .what is wrong with specializing in only one subject that you can do your best in ? .i think that people who do this are crazy because they are enjoying their life , and i think that they are destroying themselves .in the end i think that specializing in one subject is better , because we have to devide our life into working and having fun because we only live once .
