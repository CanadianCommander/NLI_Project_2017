i completely agree with the view that taking risks and trying out new things , rather than sticking to known ways , make successful people .this fact can be simply illustrated with very preliminary examples .like for example , had james watt not tried to innovate a new way of transportation option , the steam engine , and would have been satisfied with the then prevelant transportation options like horse-carts , where would we be today in terms of comfort , cost and time benefits we draw from transportation ?same is the case , if the wright brothers would have stopped after the steam engine revolution .continous evolution is always possible , because i think nothing is perfect to be accepted as it is forever .i will use more technology or business environment related examples to explain this view further .in order to remain competant and profitable , businesses have to be innovative .trying out new things enhances creativity and can lead to either new concepts , processes or products .it can also result into better ways to do an existing job and lead to most cost and time effective solutions .for example , when geographically distributed working was not as famous a concept , chinese and indian companies pioneered the offshoring concept .this led to benefits for both the parties , providing opportunities to the developing nations and huge cost savings for the customers , which effectively lowered prices for the developed countries .trying to remain in the safe zone by stick to existing known ways and not indulging into risk taking is very harmful for businesses .for example , if microsoft would have been satisfied with their windows operating system product having a huge market share and would not have innovated for improving their product , their market share would have been gobbled up by new products like linux .the most direct criticism of taking risks , is that if the existing way is well-established and near-perfect , trying new things would be waste of time .and it could be a costly venture if trying new things yields nothing , after all it is associated with risks .but i do not agree to this criticism because i believe , that even if sometimes being innovative just ends up being a cost-overhead , in long term it will definately not be so , because of the dynamic nature of our businesses and environment .
