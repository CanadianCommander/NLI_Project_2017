since the technology is getting more and more advanced , people s lives improved a lot .now people wo nt only think about how to make lives , instead , they will think about how to make their lives better .more and more entertain are requested , and people start to enjoy their lives by having entertainment .about the question whether young people enjoy life more or older people do , in my opinion , it depends on different people s perspectives and different stages they are at .this essay will discuss this issue by showing different people s point of view .for those people who are still going to elementrary school , they do nt even know what their life will be like .they have flexible schedule ; and most of their time is spent on playing .if this is also called a way to enjoy life , then the little kids express their enjoyable by enjoy playing .after a person is in the high school , he may has some ideas about what direction his life will be like .teenagers are the generation who really know how to play the technology .there is a fact that the people who know how to use computers are most teenagers .even though they have to study at school most of the time , they still have a lot of after school activities .teenagers are the ones who know how to hold a party the most ; also they are the customers who go to movie theatres often .teenagers enjoy their lives by spending time on parties , watching movies .they are the ones who know how to use entertainment .when people start their careers , obviously they do nt have enough time to do entertainment , but they still enjoy lives .after finish the whole day s work , they choose to relax themselves by watching tv , or playing sports , or listening to music .as long as they feel relax , not as stress as working , they will know how wonderful their lives are .now it s time to see how old people enjoy their lives .maybe some people will think that they are too old to enjoy life , well , it s not true .because the society is improving , people start to care old people more .there are a lot of places only for old people , and there are a lot of sports instruments for them to practice .old people like to get together and talk about their life in the past , and sometimes they will make up music bands , which some people at other age enjoy the most .based on the discussion above , it is easy to figure out that people at all ages enjoy their lives .the only difference is they enjoy lives by different ways .there might be some cases that some people always feel depressed and they do nt like their life , but in most of the situation , i think people will prefer to be happy .as long as people feel positive about their daily , they will enjoy .
