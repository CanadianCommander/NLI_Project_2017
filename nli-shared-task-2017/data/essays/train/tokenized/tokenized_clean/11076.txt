why do we have the appology of youth in our modern societies ?to me it is clearly because life sounds better when you are yuong !of course some of you could say what we are eager of in our societies is apperence .people would like to look young for ever !indeed getting old is difficult to assume not only moraly but also because your body is changing .that is one reason why people like to be young .but being good looking is not the only explanation why being young makes you more enjoy life .actually it is secondary in my opinion .what is so joyful with being young is that you have every thing to built .you are in a moment of your life where you can still chose to become anyone .no regrets for the moment , no errors in your background .when i think of my mother s sister i feel sad for her .she is a person very sour .she tried all her life to become an actrice and never succeeded .whem you are young you can still be optimistc about your life because anything can hapend to you .when you have nothing you have nothing to lose !an other advantage with being young is that usually yo have nt got many reponsibility .you have a selfish existance , the only person you have to take care of is your self .your not in charge of the education of a childe , you do not have to feed a family .life is less stressful .you do nt have to compromise every day life to make everyone happy in your house .specially when you hinge up on your parents financially , you have even less worries .i mention this situation because i am luky , that is my sitation .but some young people have to endow their life alone of course .an important point a really appreciate with being young is that socially there are not as much conventions than for adult .young people are more relax when they get in contact in professional as well as in social life .the proof is more older you get less friends you have .it is the case for my parents .it mus nt be true for everyone but it is a general tendency i have noticed .to sum up being young gives you a feeling of freedom
