people have saveral things for getting in knowledge .there is many training subjects that people have broad knowledge in one specific subject or in many academic subjects .i do nt agree with both of it .i think people should have knowledge in one specific subject and also many academic subject .because there is many problem in the world and much of them ca nt solve by knowing one subject .it requires many knowledges about different subject .for example , in engineering problems you have to know mathematics , phsics and also chemistry to solve it .i think a person also must be good at one subject and he knows everything in this subject .this gives a person self convidence for example i m an engineer and i know many thins about steel , if any body asks me some questions about it , i enjoy to tell him what he asked and i enjoy read something about it that can be in inthernet or in newspaper .and other reason for having more academic subjects is that makes people open minded .for example , if a writer knows something about history , he can write better .knowing events in the past gives him new opinion about what will happen about people .having broad knowledge in one spesific subject helps people to find a job .i think if you are really really well in one subject people need your opinion and your work .because companies hires 2 or 3 person for a subject but if you demostare them you re best in it , company prefers to hire only one .i think that only having knowledge of many subject ca nt be good for us and also having knowledge in one spesific subject ca nt helps us at all .people need both of it for being awerage than others .
