i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .many companies will do any possible things for their advertisements to make their products much more popular in the society , but do not care about the real value of the produsts .there are millions of kinds of advetisements on tv , radio , newspaper , magzines , or even mails .these various pictures and commits of the products are seemed much better than they really are .it is because that the companies want to make their products more popular in the society .for instance , burgerking will make advertisements to show how healthy their burgers or frech fry are ; however , the fact is that any junk food is no good for health .the advertisements about toys are the most popular one on the tv , since kids can not read yet and the careness parents always make their kids  requirements come ture ; the companies of toys are make millions of cartoon characters or games which based on the cartoons every year .but sometimes the real produsts are not as valuable as the commercial shows on the tv .it means that the companies do not respect the consumers  rights to purchase right and great products .on the other hand , advertisements of mechane of shape wonderful body are always fake , that nobody could just use the mechanes for several months to recreate their bodise which heritate from their parents .according to the health knowledge , a person s body shape determened by the heritation from his/her own parents ; the excercise can only help the person to make his/her body much more healthier and stronger .thus , most of the advertisements contain many fakeness , people should be aware about the negetive effects of the advertisements .meanwhile the companies should carefully think about the real purpose of making advertisements .
