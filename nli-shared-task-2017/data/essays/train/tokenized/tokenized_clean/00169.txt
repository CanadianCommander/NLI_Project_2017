do you think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?some people believe in this dream .however , i do not agree that that many people might give up on using cars in twenty years .i have got several reasons to think so .first of all , the statistics done up to now show us that there has been a rapid increase in the amount of cars in use all around the world .moreover , it seems that it is more likely to keep increasing .there are three major explanations for this rapid increasem : `` the decrease in the cost of making cars , the population growth and the overal recovery in people s financial situatuion around the world .these and related factors have been enabled more and more cars to be produced .secondly , we can easily see that transportation heavily depends on cars in most of the countries around the world .for example , in the u.s there are states and cities , like dallas , where there is no presence of a good public transportation .you almost have to have a car in order to go somewhere .moreover , statistics show that more than 60 % percent of the world transportation rely on cars .thirdly , people have been considering cars as a need rather than a luxury .especilly men start to dream of a car starting from their childhood .most people would not want to give up on their cars or their dreams to have a car .maybe in the future , in metropolitan cities like new york and istanbul , some people might stop using their cars or can be forced to do so because of the terrible trafic problem .in conlusion , it strikes me that in twenty years there will be not fewer but more cars in use than there are today because of such reasons i have mentioned above .
