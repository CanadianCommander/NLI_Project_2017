the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts might have varied opinion depending on how a person takes it but i myself agree to the statement .for me if a student understands the idea and the concept about a particular topic , the student can get a clear picture of as to how that particular concept came into being by knowing the basics for it without ever getting the thought that how did he for that matter reach to this conclusion .whereas had the student just learned the facts , he would be just having sort of an overview of the topic without knowing any in-depth details about that particular concept and still might have so many questions regarding the topic which he might have not been able to answer by learning the facts .another point to understanding ideas and concepts is that upon understanding them , it would stay in students head longer and may be permanently as by understanding he would be knowing as to how a particular concept or idea evolved .he would be knowing the fundamentals for the idea or concept and once a student is clear with his fundamentals i personally think there should not be any problem anytime recalling it .this is not the case with leaerning just the facts , as one would have to keep going back to his notes or books to memorize them as the fundamentals have not been instilled into his mind which would have been the case if he might have understood it .besides the student can also try and relate to that particular idea , which they can later narrate with ease whenever asked to do so , if he understands that particular idea , without much of straining or stressing .while this might not be the case if the student is acquainted with just the facts , as learning the facts without knowing the basics for them is equivalent to or rather is cramming which does nt help much and rather might end up pretty confused instead .an example supporting the above points that i made would be of a biology student .had the student just learned the fact about a ecology flowchart for a particular group of animals it would be okay , but might face problems when a question comprising another group of animals is given to him as he has nt understood the basic principles onto which relationship between various animals is based .on the other hand a student who understands the concept for it will have no problem of answering the question anytime as it is all crystal clear in his mind .
