i think that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years because of several reasons .first of all , there is a growing environmental awareness that is going to drive the decrease in car usage .people are increasingly aware that current pollution levels and even oil resources are not sustainable in the long term .even nowadays there are examples of city majors banning the entrance of cars to certain areas in order to protect them , and this could well be a growing trend looking forward .an efficient technological alternative to oil has to be found but until this outbreak occurs , governments would have to find a solution to make the best possible use of the limited oil resources .therefore , a possible solution would be to encourage the use of public transportation while disencouraging the use of cars ( taxes , fees to enter certain city areas , increasing parking fees , etc . )in addition to environmental awareness , i think that people would actually end up finding public transportation a better way to move around than cars .this would obviously need a general improvement of public transportation , but it seems quite reasonable that this improvement will occur with the government aligned in a drive to restrict car usage .once public transportation is improved , people will without any doubt choose it because of two resons .firstly , people like to travel in the fastest and safest way .public transportation will be a safer way of moving around than cars , and it woul even be faster , as it could avoid traffic jams .in the second place , public transportatio will prove to be more cost and time effective .people will be able to save a significant amount of money while travelling in a more time-effective way , as not only will they get to their destinations in less time but they will also be able to read or even work while they are travelling .
