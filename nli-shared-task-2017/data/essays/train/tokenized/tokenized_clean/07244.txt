i agree with that student should understand the ideas and concept than learn fact .to know and understand any thing you shuold have clear the ideas and concept of that thing or theme than only u can judge what is true and false .foremost , ideas improve your imagination , it gives u a fantacy felling , improve your concentration , it gives good exercise to your mind , you may improove the thinking abilities .for example , you refer the history of ancient era , the scientist was found the fossiles or some historical monuments .from all those evidence they might got idea abuot the culture , tradition and life style of the people of that era .moreover , by those evidence and ideas the scientist made concept of the life style , the attitude , the agriculture , the education , the food habit many more details about the people of the encient era .then they did reaserch on it and tried to find out the fact out of these .this fact gives u a clear picture of the events of the history .finally , it is true that for learning any fact of life , you must understand the ideas and concept about it so you will not get any difficulties to understand the realities of the past .present , future of life or any person or any thing .lerning fact
