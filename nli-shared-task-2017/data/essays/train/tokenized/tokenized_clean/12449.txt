people , especially students , often discuss whether having some specific knowledge about one sucject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .however , i strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more useful .this rational behind this that it allows people to have more chance to get a job .furthermore , students can learn well-balanced educations .in korea , most big companies want to recruit someone who has broad knowledge .that is because these kinds of people are more helpful to them to make a large amount of money .as everyone knows , as a matter of fact , having broad knowledge of many subjects has a disadvatage which leads to shallow knowledge .however , this advantage can eclipse this disadvantage .from my own experience , when i was a university student , i took a lot of academic courses such as biology , computer and spanish .so , i got some advantage when i got into my company , sam-sung .on top of that , students can get well-balanced educations .basically , the purpose of school is educating their students about many subjects .that is because having specific knowledge about some courses is like picky .i mean when children eat their meals , they usually pick up what they want such as meat .so , it leads to health problem , obesity , which causes various health problem .i bet that having specific knowledge is definetly harmful for their personality or their future .taking all of these into account , i have no doubt in my mind that having a lot of knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful for people in our future to reach our goals .
