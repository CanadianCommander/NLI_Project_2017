i believe that age does nt matter when it comes to enjoying life , it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeeze every drop they can get .sometimes when we are young we tend to think that old people had their time and that because they are so worried on their grandchildren , the cold weather , money problems or about their health problems they do nt enjoy life the way young people do .we believe that age is everything until that a day comes when you look back and think of the great memories you have and the great ones that will still come .my grandmother was a great example .she always used to tell me what her life was like when she was a little girl growing up in a small town and moving to a big city , going out with her firends , her curfew and when my grandpfather proposed .i thought about how great her life was but never thought about how great her life is .since we see the present as something common and even unrelevant sometimes i did nt see my grandmother s life as  exciting  let alone fun when she was 60 .now , after many other conversations , i got to know that life goes on and that every day is enjoyable , even if it s your last .my grandmother goes away on field trips with her friends while i am studying for a never ending test , cooks because she wants to and not because she has to , has great stories to tell and always waits for us with a great meal .enjoyable gets a different meaning while you are growing up .when you re little an ice cream and your mom is everything .when you get older a toy or a new friend is very important ; when you re a teenager enjoying life is having friends around you and have something you can identify with like sports ; by college the challange of living alone , traveling , going out to clubs and having a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoying your youth .by the time you graduate hopefully you ll get a good job , marry the man of your dreams and watch your kids grow up .every step of the way is enjoyable then .in my opinion there are no times when you enjoy things more than others , it s up to you to make every effort for every moment to be worthy and worthwhile .
