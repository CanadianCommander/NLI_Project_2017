a person is succesful because the person has different skills than an average person has .i believe that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .successful pople are open minded , and they experience new things to improve their skils .first of all , successful people have wide horizons , and they have no limits .they try all types of new things so these new things make the people achieve succes in their life .for instance , bill gates is a successful person .he had a broad horizons , and created the microsoft .he had an idea to create an application in order to improve people s lives .his work in technology made people gain some extra time in their work .second of all , people who like to experiment new things reach succes in life .successful people should have new ideas , and these new ideas lead people to experiment .experimenting a new thing let other things to come out .people with new experiments and new ideas help society to rise so these experiments positively affect the public as a whole .for instance , the turkish leader ataturk is a successful person .he experiment new revolutions in turkey .he brought latin alphabet instead of the arabic alphabet , and also he let woman to vote in turkey after he was chosen as a presedent .his revolutions led turkey to be secular country instead of being a religious country .he made changes as whole in the public as a individual .as a result , trying new things and be open minded lead people to success .i believe succesful people have a mind that is very broad , and they can bring their dream true in life .they can make possitive affect on the pei
