many people live for their enjoyment of life .however , people do not do same things .some people are going to travel and other people are doing their own hobbies in their home .like that , young people want to more exciting one like extreme sports , and older people want to do something comfortable like reading books .therefore , someone says `` young people enjoy like more htan older people do .however , i disagree about it .i think both young and older people enjoy their lives much even though they do differently .as i said above , young people usually want to do something exciting and even dangerous if it gives enjoyment to them , so there are more young people in such as skiing jump contests .moreover , young people do more academic things like math contests like me .although now i am not interesting that much , i was so exciting when i was solving very difficult math problems at around 9th grade .actually there are few older people in the contests , but there are a number of young people .like that , many young people enjoy physical things and also sitting and reading books or solving math problems .it is why some people say young people enjoy life more than older peole do becuase young people do more things than older people do .however , older people enjoy their lives as much as young people do although older people usually want to do something comfortable and safe .when we visit our grantparent , we usually find they are reading many books or making clothes for their granddaughter .by doing these things , they enjoy their lives .my grandfather also played many korean chess games with me .at that time , i was not interesting that , but he was .so i asked it .he said he was so happy when he did something with me and my sister .i do not still understand him , but i knew he enjoyed it .as i am growing , my enjoyment are changing little by little .however , i did not think i enjoy my life less than when i was young .just the way to enjoy is changed .young people have their own interesting and enjoyment , and older people have also own things .i do not think which one is better or which one is more enjoyable .it depends on them not their age .
