in these day , advertisements is the one of important marketings in business because it can be the first impression like on a screen of television , for 30 seconds chance can change customers  needs .i agree that some of advertisements make the product look like the best qulity than real .primarilly , visual effect is the biggest impact one in society .televisoin is common media and most valuable marketing for business .when you watch one commercial on television like vaccumer , they show us that stuff works well and look luxury .however when you buy it , mostly time we realize that it does nt work longer as much as we paid and after use several time , it looks cheap .even we knew that the advertisement will not be the true but we believed our eyes through the screen .this kind of cases , the moment of commercial , it should look the best product that ever made .secondary , i am interesting in business so if i sell my products , i will make my idea seems like much better than it was existed .i want to make them to use my products like good value not srteet one .if they do nt seem fantastic , they will never try to buy and use .i think that people have bias before they know better .good looking is good impression .this is the marketing of advertisement .however , we should be careful about that because when we loose clients , deceived them , you never be succeed .advertisement is giving a chance to ues to customs and show them their quality and value not just selling them and making money .honesty is the best policy .in conclusion , i agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .advertisements are the creative job and important method for market but we should remember that whenener looks good should be good qualities .
