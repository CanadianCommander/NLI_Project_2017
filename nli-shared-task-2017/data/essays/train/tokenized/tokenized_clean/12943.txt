the agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the scarcity of fuel needed to run the cars and the awareness created about the amount of pollution these vehicles cause .generally cars consume lot of fuel and also give less mileage which means that we need to fill fuel very reguarly .people use cars for comfort especially when they need to travel longer distances , rather than sitting in a bus or train and stressing themselves and this implies that the amount of fuel consumed is high .fuel is getting depleted and thus the governments are made to pay a lot to import fuel and thus leading to hike in fuel prices and making the layman think about the utilization of cars which are costing him a lot .thus in future this hike will be more and will make people think of whether to buy a car or not .the amount of toxic gases released by the combustion of these fuels is quite high and thus leading to troubles for humans and other living beings on earth .thus the governments may think of other alternatives of transportation and thus try to impart this to all the citizens and provide them with some common transportation like a train .it may make it mandatory also when the situation worsens .this could cut down the use of cars and thus leading to fewer cars after twenty years .another thing that need to be considered is the place it occupies .because of the huge size and the fact that these is less accomodation , it leads to traffic jams and congessions especially in big cities .thus making people to think about it and find a solution for it by using common means of transportation which could help them reach their destination on time .cars provide luxury and comfort but inspite of this , the fact is that there are more problems associated with it than comforts .thus in my opinion in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
