i really agrea with the point that says most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .in fact tey have to do that to attract the customers .as a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not .as i said most of the time the usually products looks much better than the are .every comany or shop does that .it is just part of their business .the more they sell means the more they are successfull in their work , and in their business .these kind of adertisements became normal and common in these days , even though there are a few copanies say the right things about their products as they seem .anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for us .as we know each comany has its own plan to attract the customer .in these days they even try to call you , and introduse their items to you .you would see alot of advertisements on internet , in newspapers , in magazines .sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free .that thing happened to me , when i was going to buy a cell phone , which has a sticker on it says free .i was suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly as you like .we see strange things that has to do with markting , because everyone wants to be the best .since that they try to do anything to show their items as they want .in my openion they have the right to make products seems much better than the really are .
