i think understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than simply learning so-called `` facts  .history has repeatedly proved that past `` facts  turn out to be false .for example , people used to think that all species on earth were created by god and they remain the same all the time .today , almost all biologists believe that evolution is the driving force behind all species , past and present .as environment change , old species extinct and new species emerge .god has no role in evolution .consequently , learning the facts may leave you with wrong information .if remembering facts is not good , will understanding ideas and concepts help ?definitely .if we think about the above example , people believe god as the only creator of species because they do nt question the claim and never ask for valid evidence to support it .the idea behind such claim should then be `` how do we know ?well , in 1859 charles dalwin gave many evidence in his historical `` on the origin of species : the theory of evolution  .as time goes by , many scientists found more and more evidence to support the theory .such evidence lies in fossils , similarities between living plants and animals and their ancient ancestors and even dna of all organisms .we now know all living things share the same universal hereditary code , i.e. , dna .some people may argue that learning facts help a lot when you do nt have access to information you need .like when a nurse wants to know how many grams equal to an ounce .however , in the modern `` information time  when internet is universally accessible and most facts are available on you fingertips .most hospital units in the u.s.a. are equipped with computers connected to the internet .a nurse can simply `` google  `` gram to ounce  and get the conversion rate right away .we no longer need to remember all the `` facts  .ideas are more important than facts .
