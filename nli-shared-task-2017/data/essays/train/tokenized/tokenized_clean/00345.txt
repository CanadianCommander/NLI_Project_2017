i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .but this is my opinion , i think the common opinion of the customers ; in the other hand i have to say that the opinion of the people involved in the production of advertising is different .first i want to provide my personal experience .two weeks ago i bought a personal computer of the last generation of computer .the advertising was amazing , the quality of the screen and the powerful of the cpu showed incredible .in reality it s just the evolution of a normal computer , nothing of special .this is just an exemple of a personal experience but i think that there are millions of customers in italy that every day are pussed by the advertisemets to buy something that is in reality differs from what presented .i have the chance to have a friend working in an agency that develops advertisemnts for both italian or foreign clients .her opinion is not in costrast with mine but she things that the problerms is not the advertisement in it self but how the people want to see the advertisement .her point is that the some customer needs to believe that a product can improve his quality of life and then he buy it , but , once he has bought the object , he realizes that his life has no changed and so he is not satisfied by the object .at the end he believes that the responsible for his disatisafaction is the advertisement .as conclusion i want to say that most advertisement show products much better than they really are , even if part of the responsability for an error in buying an object can in part due to the customers .
