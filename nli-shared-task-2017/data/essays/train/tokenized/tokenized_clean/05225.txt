hana tour , uri tour . ..they are the platcard that we can see easily around us .you will think go to to travel in goup led by a tour guide looks great idea .but what i want to say here is that method is not a best way .best wayto travel is go to trip not with a tourguide .that cause more fun and give you unforgartable memories .do you actually think go trip with guide is fun ?the answer is no .if you travel with out tour guide , then you can go to anywhere you want .with tourguide , you have to follow the skedule , and be more careful to your behabiors not to behave badly to others .and the worst thing is that tour guide even instruct the time of resting .like `` 10 minute !  or `` 1hour !.we ca nt rest enough or do what ever we want with a tourguide .maybe we will learn more and get some extra-knowledge but remember that we can know it easily from books or other source like computer or tv .it s sure that you will get charming memories by traveling with out tourguide .with tour guide , you have to do what he or her instructed .it s right that there are low percentage of accident like losting , when you go trip with tour guide , but think diffrently , it can be a one source of experiences .an accident , meeting ...in my cases , when i was traveling with my family , not a tourguide , we made a friends in the who live in other country .i still communicate with them nowadays too .they helped me a lot in many things .but when i travel with tourguide , i do nt enjoy trip much .lie down on the snow for long time is lomantic things , but you ca nt even dream it with tourguide .you will also feel bad or tired , but long times later , that memory will be unforgatable in you mind , that can tell to the other people you know .having fun and precious memories is really needs in traveling .with out tourguide , sometime even annoying , you can enjoy the real point of trip .peoples , let s packed the bag and go to trip where we can refresh ourselves !: d
