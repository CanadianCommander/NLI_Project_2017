nowadays a lot has been said about the role of the advertisement in the current society .some marketing practicationers have defended the idea that marketing and , in particular , advertisement keep playing a neutral role in the modern society by only promoting the features of a product .on the contrary , among academics and most of the public opinion , this claim has completely been rejected .in my opinion this second position best highlights what the actual situation really is :products are overpushed through the advertisment channels by mistelling what they really value for the final customer .ever more commercials promise customers greater benefit from their products misleading the real wants and needs of them .modern advertisment are able to manipulate the customer will and often convince him/her to buy products not really wanted .it may also happen that the features illustrated by the commercial are really disappointing to the customer when this experience the product .furthermore , by lying to the customer through advertisment , the firm can really harm the final consumer .this is the case of those kind of products that cause accident to the user .these products tend to overestimate the capacity of certain features exposing the cutomer to danger .since , i think , this issue is tremendously current , more attention should be given to it .it involves ethical problems which must not be avoided .only through a new conception of advertisement , i would call it an ethical advertisement , things can get better for people .
