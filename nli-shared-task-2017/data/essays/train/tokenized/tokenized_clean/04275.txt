according to my point of view , learning facts is important for students as well as learning concepts and ideas .indeed , they are the two sides of the same icon , let s say `` the learning icon  , because facts show that concepts and ideas are right or wrong in the real world .in addition , they show how different ideas can be interconnected or influenced by each other and provide an effective way to make a concept understandable .concepts and ideas must be learnt , but how to verify them ?physics is a very important example .you can learn much about physics by reading a book and solving mathematical equations .but how to show that all the learnt knowledge is right and applicable ?you need to know about experiments which show the constraints of your theories , therefore you need to `` learn facts  .then , facts are important to teach how different concepts and ideas are related .think about mechanical science , for example .there are many concepts , often coming from other different fields .students can learn them but how they can truly understand how a system works without studying a machine which is an application of all those ideas and therefore a fact by definition ?finally , let me highlight that facts have always provided an effective way to understand a concept or an idea .einstein was very famous for many funny examples which he used to explain his own theories .another example is informatics .if you want to learn informatics , i am sure you will be told that you can compare a processor to a brain , a folder to a desk where you store papers and documents and so on .summarizing , it is my firm opinion that facts are necessary for an effective learning .you need them to verify theories , to explain how many concepts are related and to provide examples for a better understanding .a famous statement is that history , here facts , is a great life teacher
