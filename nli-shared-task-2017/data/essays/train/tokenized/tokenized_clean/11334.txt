as far as i can see , this statement is absoluty correct .learning or even memorizing facts might be usefull and effective right in front of an examination if you just want to pass it .but if you want to obtain good results , memorizing will not help you win the day at all .let me clarify this .as soon as it comes to similar topics which are only associated with the content that you are familiar with , the one who only learned facts will not be able to answer the questions as appropriately as if he had learned the concept and ideas behind the facts .but as far as you are familiar with the main ideas , you will definetely be able to give brilliant answers as you only need to transfer them onto the new topic .let me point this out on an example .i work as an assistent at the faculty of law at my university .my job is to correct term papers on several subjects associated with labour law .within these papers students have to proof that they on the one hand have understood what was lectured during the semester and on the other hand that they are able to transport this knowledge onto new subjects .in general , i call a student `` smart and clever  when he is capable of transporting knowledge to different subjects and develop his own position .unfortunately i came recently to know that obviously piles of students have not really understood what the professer tried to convey .reproduction of facts is quite boring to a teacher after having read them several times .but transportation of knowledge and using this knowledge to evaluate new problems is exciting .therefore i would say , that memorizing facts is definetely less important than understanding the main concepts and ideas of the subject .
