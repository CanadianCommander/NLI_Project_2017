during the education , the studies and even when deciding for a job , people are often put in front of an important question : is it better to get very deep into one specific subject or to keep a more broad mind .there are several arguments supporting both sides .on the one hand , the amount of knowledge and information is getting always bigger nowadays because of the internet and the globalisation .so if you want to work on a special topic and produce or design products or even develope new technologies , it is very important to really understand this topic .and because of the enormous amount of information mentioned before , one has to specialize in this single subject .on the other hand most inventions and developments made today , are just a part of a bigger system .so after inventing and producing very special elements , there have to be people who do not neccesarily understand every detail of this element , but who know how to put them together to one big and working system .they have to keep all aspects in mind and they also must know where to look if something does not work .very specialized peole would have no chance here , because they only understand their own component .so broad minded people are needed .another point is that people speciaized in one single subject often have very big problems when communicating with other people specialized in a different subject , because they know nothing about it .here broad minded people are very helpful to connect members of different subjects because they have enough knowledge in both areas .finally one also has to see the situation out of a very pragmatic point of view .if you have to leave the company you are working in because it goes bankrupt or whatever , you will have to look for a new job and of course the chances to get employed in a new company is much bigger if you can work in a broad field , than if you only can do one specific work .taking everything into consideration , i have to say that nowadays , specialists are very important in our society .but people with a broad knowledge of different acadenic subject are definetly needed and at least as important as specialists .
