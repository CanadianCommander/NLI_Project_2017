i agree with the statement that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in our days the companies have a lot of possibilities to show the customers all the benefits of their products .the can make advertisement in tv , radio , in the newspapers , in the internet , etc .every potential customer , that actually means every person is confronted with a variety of advertisement every day .but not only the place where an advertisement is made is important .also the kind of advertisement .that means that there are a lot of visual and auditional possibilities to provide a companys  product .for example they can use a lot of colours and voices to create new wishes or dreams for the customer .and most of the time the companies only show us the benefits of their products .they do nt explain us the negative aspects or some possible problems we could get with the product .with all the possibilities of marketing the companies have , it s nearly impossible for the customer to see how good or bad a product really is .until he really buys and uses it .this seems to be thew main problem .the customer is not able to control what the advertisement promisses without buying the product .especially the internet offeres a lot of people to provide bad products .there re so many possibilities to sell damaged or just bad products and nobody can do something against it .thus , it is very good that in germany there are some institutes like `` stiftung warentest  who tests and controlls every month a few kind of different products and recommends the best of them .because of that a customer can usually be sure that a product is good or not so good .
