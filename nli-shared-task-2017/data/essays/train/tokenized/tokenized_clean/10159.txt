cars are playing a domintant role in human society .cars benefits people a lot ; they make us travel faster than by bicycle ; they make it convenient for people to travel to a concert .however , cars also do harms to our daily life ; one of the most fatal harms cars make is the air pollution .there has been a debate that whether people will give up using cars in future years .as far as i am comcerned , cars will definitely be supplanted by other forms of transportation because of their disadvantages , though ther have oe or two advantages .there re several reasons why the number of cars will decrease .although cars have minor advantages to society , the numerous bad effects will make them dissapear after several years .a car can produce at least three tons of carbon dioxide , which lead to the serious green-house effect , and several tons of nitrogen dioxide , which result from a black smoke around the sky .with the number of cars growing in the past years , the air pollution made by car is increasingly serious these days .the laws of forbiding the use of cars have even be made in some country such as indoesia and china .as a result , the number of the cars will definitely decline after a few years .another reason for the declining of cars is the limited road conditions .the more cars in the road , the slower they move .even in some areas , people riding bicycle are much faster than people driving cars .in singapore for example , the streets are full of automobiles .it s quite difficult for one car to move a foot .if people see that there are a myriad of cars standing in the street , then how could they buy cars any more in thefuture ?though cars do benefits in some minor ways , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobiles before the entirely disappearing of cars , the total number of cars will be fewer in the past twenty years .
