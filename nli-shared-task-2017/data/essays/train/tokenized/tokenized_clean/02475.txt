i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .nowadays , advertisements are every convinient .we can simply stay our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere .however , we should know that advertisements are not only for customers , but also retailers .in order to sell more products , advertisements make the products seems better than themselves .eventhough they do not want to buy them , retailer let them consider buying the products .in my opinison , the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are , inaccurate estimations , skilled retailer s saling .first , we have a lot of way to get information , such as internet , or tv shows .since these are immediate enviroment for our modern society , the advertisements affect us a lot .however , beause of the well established network , customers tend to buy the products without seeing them .if we do not see the product , less likely estimated accurately .for example , e-bay is the major shopping tool these days .we buy products without seeing them .i have a experience that the test i bought seems like intact from the picture on the internet , however , it was water damaged .if i could get the text at bookstore , i will not have this kinds of problem .second , there are many well developed way to sell a products .they know what the customers wants .they like to buy a nice product with unexpensive price .it can be less expensive than reasonable price .the retailer use discounts or limiting number of selling products and try to attract customers attension .in this moment , customers tend to think it is reasonalble or not rather than it is good products or not .therefore , the price of products distruct the customers  attension toward price .to conclude , beauce of inaccurate estimations and distructing by the price of product , we seems buy products wich are actually not as good as they expected .therefore , we should aware of what we want , and what we need .we should think twice that advertisements are not as good as we think .in this way , we less likely think that advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
