i personnaly agree with this statement .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not that easy , it is true .but let me tell you this ; albert einstein has a quote : `` knowledge is power.  which is completely true .think of biology without chemistry ; chemistry without physics ; physics without geometry : geometry without math and so on . ..a chemist can not explain why the electrons make an orbital shape around the nucleus without physics , can he ?or a physics master can not measure the shadow that a candle makes when he lits it , can he ?another important point can be thought of easily when we think about the important people who majored in their fields and that we still know of even if they lived centuries and even thousands of years ago .take pascal as an example .he has a lot of proven theories in math , physics . .is nt it odd for him to have more than one field which he majored and made himself known of ?the answer to these questions i pointed out are simple and true : the laws of nature , the languages spoken , people and all the others that we know of are on only one place : here on earth .no one can prove that the facts about it are nt linked to one another .the links between the facts are so tight that if you start learning at one end , you will end up in finding yourself at the other .so , learning physics , learning chemistry , learning literature or any other topic is not that important to worry about .you will find yourself at the other hand if you study hard and learn a lot .the only question is where to start the adventure .but do not stick to the beggining because you will have a lot missing if you do nt finish it until the end .do nt be stuck in a subject of life , try to get to know the whole piece .
