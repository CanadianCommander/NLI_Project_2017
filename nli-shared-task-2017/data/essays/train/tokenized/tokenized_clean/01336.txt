peresonally , i disagree with the statement that young people engjoy life more than older people do .of course , it is not true to say that young people do not enjoy life .they engoy life .for instance , they play some sports or study various things and so on .but , generally speaking , old people can do same things , too .therefore we can not say that young people enjoy life more than older peple do .i think older pepole can enjoy life more .there are two reasons .first of all , they do the things that young people ara not able to do easily .for example , they can do luxuary things such as clusing or traveling all over the world , because they are more rich than yonger people .second of all , they know the way to enjoy more than young peple .older people have much experiense than yonger people and they have more favorite things .for example , my grandmother takes part in various activity such as flower arrangement and playing tenis .that means they can enjoy life in various ways .in conclusion , i think older people enjoy life more than young people , because of their money and experiense .
