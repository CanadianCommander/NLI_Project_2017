i actually live in barcelona , a city with a lot of traffic .i have a car but i usually go everywhere by public transport .i only use the car to go outside the city .however , nowdays are a lot of cars everywhere and , in general , we use the car for go everywhere .consequently , it s difficult to imagine a city with fewer cars .i really think that in a short period of time it will be less cars everywhere .there are a lot of reasons for think like that .the first one , is that in some years will be very expensive use the car .for example , the petroleum resources are finishing and everyday the gas price is increasing .another example is that in barcelona in most of the places we have to pay to park the car .this reasons make public transport cheaper in comparation with car s price .the second reason is that in the big cities is faster go by public transport everywhere than go by car .we have a very functional and complete underway , with a lot of lines .it is also very regular , we have one every five or ten minutes .moreover , there are a lot of underway stations in the city .if you use this stations you do nt have to spend time looking for a place to park the car .on the other hand , the people who live outside the city has a lot of problems for use public transport .in most of the little cities or towns , the public transport only works one time in an hour or maybe the station is at 30 minutes walking .if this happens , it s easier and faster go by car than use a public transport .in summary , i think that the number of cars will decrease in the big cities , with good public transport , and it will be the same in the litlle cities and towns .unless the goverment improve the public transport overthere .in conclusion i think that it will be fewer cars in the future but it will not happen everywhere .
