nelson mandela had once said `` great nations never form by individuals but by the community at large  .in today s era where every human being is on the lookout for his own personal meet , community service has been long forgotten .i strongly agree with the statement that the younger generations have forgotten to help their own community .with the advent of new gadgets like televisions , cable tv , videogames etc children of today never bother to come out of their homes lest talk about helping the community .the world in the past has witnessed many people , freedom fighters fighting for their own community working towards a betterment of the community .people like nelson mandela , mahatma gandhi have laid down their lives for the betterment of the community .in today s era fighting for freedom is not an important issue but there are other important issues to be handled and the need of the hour is to join hands and work for the upliftment of the communities .the community needs young fresh blood who can work with the same dedication and enthusiasm like the younger generation of the earlier times .there are old age homes , charitable institutes , laughing clubs for the old people who need care and support of people .the blacks in america faced quite a bit of problem in the early times but they had a force to deal with the situation spearheaded by sir nelson mandela who himself was very young when he thought of rendering his services for his community .the younger generation nowdays belive in spending time with friends and peer mates discussing movies , games , entertainment etc but do not find time to spend some quality time with his/her own community people .a recent survey report also suggests that children in the us prefer subjects like physical education and arts to subjects like community service .such subjects on offer have also reduced considerably in the last decade because of the less number of students being enrolled in such subjects .socializing is an aspect which has been forgoten amongst the younger generation and children feel better rather more comfortable being cooped up at their own homes with the source of entertainment being tv s , internet and music .some factors maybe because of the fact that children now have extra work load in schools or colleges and thus get less time to serve the community .
