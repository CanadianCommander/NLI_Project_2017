i completely agree with the statement according to which advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .what make me think that is my reflections on the marketing strategies used by companies during my marketing class .advertisement strategy is based usually on the following three pillars , making the packaging of the product agressive , by creating a new consumption trends that do not necessary correspond to the real needs of consumers , and by making the product looks the unique one adapt for the costumer needs .all the above mentioned pilars of marketing concentrate the effort on improving the perception of the product not the inner characteristics of it .does improving the attractive capacity of the packaging material in which the product will be sold will improve it qualities ?i am convinced that it will make only the consumer choose it even if it has a higher price or lower quality .the colours of package will attract the eyes of the consumers from other similar product that could be a better choice in terms of quality and price .the consumption trends have to do with a certain image created for the ideal consumer of the product , this can be achieved by using very famous artists or singers in promoting the product or by the use of very beautifull women or handsome men , according to the product consumer target , which implicitly gives the idea that if you use this product you will be act as your favorite actor or singer .again it has not anything to do with the product itself , it is only a created and virtual image .the last pilar is making the consumer think that the product is done to satisfy his or her needs as if in the mass production era it is possibile to have an unique product made for an uniqe consumer .in my point of view the best way to deal with advertisement is try to consider shopping as an activity necesary to satisfy the own needs and not like a tool to look more trendy or more modern ,
