when i was young , i tired many new things and took risks of doing anything .i tried skipping english class when i was in grade 5 , i tired yelling at my parents when i was 4 years old , and i tired copying my homeworks from others  when i was in grade 2 .now i think back , and i regret .i surely should not try new things or take any risks when i was young or when i thought about the results .after 18 years , i do nt think i m more favourable or more successful than other people .maybe i should do what i already know how to do well is better for me .many people say that they should try some new things instead of following the path they already do well .however , they still have their improvements to do the things even better .well is not good , perfect is good .they should try to do their thing perfect before they try new things and take risks .in this modern competative society , people afraid to fell off , people afraid to lose .no one wants to be the loser or no one wants to lose their games .why should they have to try new things or take risks to do the things they already know how to do well ?they should just follow their ways to go .taking risks or trying new things maybe is good for advance , or even get the better result .but if they try to do perfect in the things they already how how to do well .somehow their results are even better , or even they will be happier .people will praise your abilities , your knowledages , your thoughts .nevertheless , what if they lose when they try new things and take risks ?they will be so upset and maybe they wo nt have any motivation to do what they already know how to do well .the result is more harsh for them or they ca nt even take it .so , in sum i think they shou
