i agree this statement .because there are some problems in cars .for example car accident , porution and trafic problems .i will explain why i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are to day .especialy i will forcus on the enviroment problems .one major reason that i agree this statement is enviroment polution .recentry this is big problem .co2 from cars destroyed ozon .as a lesult templeture becoming high .so ice in north pole and south pole is melting .then water level becoming high .in a few years later , cost and city near cost will dissapear .it is seriouse ploblem .so many people try to stop this ploblems .for example i always use pubric transformation such as train and bus .but cause is not only car but also our life .for example plastic bag and air conditioner .govermant and people try to save earth recentry .because earth is good place to live .there are trees , airs and waters .so we realised that we have to clean the earth to live long time .however cars has no advantages for the earth .it just polute .so it will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the other example of these opinion is plastic bag.5 years ago it was usual to use plastic bag .we could get free at super market .but now we have to pay for it .so people become using own bag .i think it is same as cars .the plastic bag that 5 years ago is same as car in now .the plastic bag in now is same as car in 5 years latter .it will less than now .in conclusion , cars will be fewer than now .because it is not good for enviloment .if we continued using it we could not live the earth in twenty years latter .so i agree that statement .
