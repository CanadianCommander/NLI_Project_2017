in general , the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do , is difficult , if not impossible , to give a clear answer to .in our family , there are both examples of young as well as older people like my grandmother , who enjoy their life in a similar way .of course , older people do not have as many possibilities as provided to younger people .nowadays , young people can use internet to read newspapers , check e-mails or watch movies online .or younger people can go abroad on an exchange semester , like i have done .all things , which older people have grown up with or experienced before and therefore , are not familiar with .however , it depends more on the personal attitude towards life than on your age if you enjoy life or not .my grandmother is a good example for that .she is the most amazing woman i have ever met in my life .even when she has to go to the hospital because of her illnesses , all doctors , nurses and patients admire her because of ther constant optimism .in her opinion , it is of utmost importance to be active and to be kept informed by reading newspapers , books , and watching television .it drives her spirit to learn new things she has never heard of before , even though she is already 80 years old .it is a whole different story , if old people start being confused or do not remember things and thus need to be taken care of .for example , my friend s grandfather was once brought home by the police because he could not find the way back to his home anymore .this is the time when being older starts becoming a burden for relatives .in conclusion , it can be said that it totally depends on your own attitude and not on your age , whether or not you will enjoy your life however , it should also be taken into consideration that at some point of our life we might want to enjoy life the same as younger people do , but are not capable of doing so anymore .
