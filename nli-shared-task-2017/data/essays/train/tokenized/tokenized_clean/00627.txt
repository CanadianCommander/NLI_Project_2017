learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning facts .understanding the ideas and concepts is a very important step in the learning process , it helps students absorbe the essence of the topic .for example : jenny has to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusions based on her knowledge .tis step is more general , it includes more aspects than the next one .after getting the main points of a lesson , students learn the facts .this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied .in contrast with understandind the ideas , learning facts is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspects of your interest .in my opinion understanding the ideas and concepts is as important as learning the facts .i have been in contact with both of the ways of studiyng and i have got better grades when i learn the facts than when i focuse on understanding the lesson .even though when i learn the facts i usually dont get the esence of the lesson , i get better grades .it is a little absurd but almost all of my classmates had the same problem .that is why i state in my personal opinion that the understanding is as important as memorizing .it is a way of itegrating two proceses that complete each other and forming a whole , joining both steps .as a result the flaws of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa .for me , the perfect learning process would be the one which includes both of the steps mentioned above , linking them by relating the overview of a lesson with the specific facts that support it .
