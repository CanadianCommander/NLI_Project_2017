i do nt think that this statement is correct .in germany young people have the choice between `` zivildienst  and the `` bundeswehr  .most young people say `` no i do nt wa nt to go to the army ( bundeswehr )  and instead spend nine `` social month  ( zivildienst ) in for example hospitals or `` altenheime  a place where old people can go and where they live until the end of there lives .in that nine month , every young person can help their community and the hole society .in germany the social sector wouldny be able to survive without these `` zivildienstleistende  , the guys who do nt want to go to the army .i for myself did nt want to go to the army because they couldt tell my when i can go there and when i would be finish .so i decided that i make these `` social nine month  .these nine month gave me the oppertunity to help old people , speak and listen to him and to give them a good feeling .it maybe sounds cracy , but old people are realy happy when they see me coming .often they are left alone , nobody of there familie comes to visit them so they are happy to have someone to talk with .i also think that there are many young people who do a lot without earing money for it .in my freetime i play handball in a club and every year we organize a big party where about 600 people have always ( ! )a lot of fun .to organize such a event you need a lot of people and everybody helps to make this possible again , year after year .what i want to say with this is very simple .the money that is earned with this party is spend for the smalest children in the club .they get new balls or tshirts .all the money is spend for a good use .here this is called social engagement and i think the different forms of engagement are also under the young part of the society still not dead .a lot of young persons want to tell the older ones there ideas to help and to make the different events much better for everyone .another example in my opinion is the pope visit in colone at the `` world child day  .over 500.000 young people wanted to see pope benedikt .that shows me that on the one hand religion is not dead ( insted it comes back ! )and on the other hand that a lot of young people whant to `` push  society and there community forwards .in the last time you can hear much ofter guys that want to publish there opinion to take influence at the public meaning .i think young people do a lot more to help there communities as in the past , even if the way young people chose is often not that understud as young people want to .
