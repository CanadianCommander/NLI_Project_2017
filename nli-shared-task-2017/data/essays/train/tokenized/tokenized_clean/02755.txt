nowadays we are completely surrounded by every kind of advertisements ; watching tv , listening to the radio or surfing the web , it is almost impossible to skip advertisements .they belongs to our society now ; they can be sometimes annoying but at the same time they are important for a company to improve the name of its brand and the knowledge of it on the consumers .personally i am not critic about advertisements ; sometimes i like to focus my attention on them , i do like buying some magazines just to take a look on fashion advertisements and i have to admit some of them are reallly funny and smart .they are now so important that many companies tend to spend huge amounts of money and making cospicuous investments on them in order to gain customer trust and obviously profits .nevertheless all this i have just explained is not always supported by a good product in terms of quality : it happened to me many times in the past and i was really hungry about .i bought a particular doll to give as a present to my little sister in-law , she was just 4 and according to the advertisement that nice doll had to walk and to use rollerblade only with three batteries .i was absolutely enthusistic about the idea and i was sure that my littke sister for sure would appreciated .finally , she opened the box and our joy soon turned into rage since the doll did not work at all even with the batteries ; so the advertisemet was really tricky and mislead .moreover i felt really bad because my lovely sister was clearly disappointed .in conclusion , this was just a personal experience but now since that day , i feel more mature and confident when i choose a product , sometimes we should trust on advertisements but not completely and always being aware .
