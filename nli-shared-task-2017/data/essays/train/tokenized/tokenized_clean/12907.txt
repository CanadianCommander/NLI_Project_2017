when asked the question what the key of success is , different people may hold different perspective as per their own experience and behavior .some people believe in doing same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful ; but , i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risk .the reason , i think this way is because we learn a lot while doing something new and it opens the door of success .therefore , by trying new things and taking risk , we learn something new which leads us to succeed evantually .one reason , i believe that trying new things leads us to succeed is that new attempts always explore the new area of growth for us .when we try something new we learn about that field which help us to grow .take my wifes example .she was working in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and she was very fond of female make up .at mis of her life she tried with an attempt to work as a beutician .surprisingly she got tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty salloon .successful people never stick to one profession .other reason , i believe that taking risk and trying new things bring success is because it bring creativity in person which leads to success in life .when we try new thing in life then our brain works more faster and we feel more challanging .anil ambani is the biggest example .he had a creative mind who always tries to do something new ank taking risk .he kept on trying new business in india and doing excellent work .his this habit has made him most successful business man in india .in short , nevetheless taking risk has some disadvantages of loosing money some time but this would not prevent me in taking risk in my life .
