i agree with this statement , ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in my opinion , successful people has great ability to do something , efoort a bit , and good luck .as you see some famous stars or celebrities , they are mostly clever and have amazing ideas which no one had never though .however , they had also risks because they are trying to do something new .new things must have risks because no one had tried before .although they had risks , they always try and get succeed .needless to say , it s not easy , but they have strong feelings to do what they want to do .in addition , they have experiences and knowledges , for example about bisiness , arts , trading money , and so on .this is the most important thing to be succeed .on the other hand , people who want to something new , but are afraid of doing that can never be succeed .if they really want to be succeed , they should be brave to try new things .however , if they do nt have any own plans and people who help and support them , they must not try if they want to do .as a result , in my opinion , successful people always learn , study , compair and check others .they read books , magazines , get information and so on .then first of all , they want to try as soon as possible , faster than others .taking risks are not matter for them .being interested is the most imoirtant thing to be succeed .if we are not interesting in everything at all , we ca nt find any new things .not only feeling that , but also knowledge , ability effort and energy are needed .no one ca nt be susseed without them what i told .
