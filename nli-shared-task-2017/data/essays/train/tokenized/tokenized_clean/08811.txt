people are constantly exposed to the facts being broadcasted through means of books , media , or the internet , but it is more important for the people to undertand the ideas and the concepts behind those facts than just learning about them .a person might know a fact , but if she does not understand why such thing is happening , such a fact would not do any good to her .understanding is crucial , because it creates a huge impression on the minds of students while the facts impress them only when they hear about it .in most high schools , the students in history class are exposed to facts .however , it is their responsibility to go home and understand why such things happened in the past .it makes logical connections between the events , which helps the student to remember the facts even after a long time has passed .moreover , the essay questions on exams for such cources tend to ask why an event has occured , asking teachers would not be asking such questions on the exams were it not for the importance of them .understanding is important , because it is what brings changes .when i was younger , i did not feel any need to study .i was getting decent grades at school wihtout much effort , even though i was not the best .some told me that it might be a good idea for me to start studying , for it would make my future so much easier .however , i never listened .i knew that i would have to start studying someday , but did not believe it to be that moment .i started to work harder at the school only after i understood the facts that were known to me all along .i did not just know that i had to study , but i understood that if i do not , my life will be very different from the one i always dreamed of .i could finally understood , only after i met some students in their last year of high school regretting over the things they have not done .if it were not for the understanding part of my experience , i might still be a slacker .learning facts is less important , because they can be found everywhere .the world we live in is now filled with information .therefore , we can look up the facts in seconds if we wanted to .understanding , however , can not be found on the internet .it is something that one needs to try to achieve .therefore , it is more valuable than mere facts .understanding is more important , because it allows us to apply the ideas on many fields .it is possible to read a book a medical student might be required to read .however , if one can not understand what the book says , the information is useless to her .it can not be applied to anywhere else , and might be lost to her in seconds .since understanding brings changes , requires effort , and makes facts applicable , it is much more important than the learning facts .moreover , it will last help the facts to stay on one s mind longer than learning without understanding .
