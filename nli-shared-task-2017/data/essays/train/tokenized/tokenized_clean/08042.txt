i agree with the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than memorizing facts .in the following paragraphs i will give you reasons and an example why i am convinced of the correctness of the statement .first of all , it s true , that in any field of study there is always some kind of `` must know  facts , that a student has to know .apart form this one can always look up detailed information in a book , on the internet or any other reliable source of information .thus , learning facts is a practice to train your memory but it wo nt allow you to solve complex problems where you need a structure and a concept to follow .thats why learning or even memorizing facts does nt make sense from an economical point of view : you waste your energy , time and `` storage  with learning things that you can look up anytime you need them .as an example you could take historic dates : what if a student could tell you every date of battles on european territory between the 15th and the 19th century but ca nt conclude any connection with international relations in that time from these facts .it would certainly help him win an award in memorizing , but he would never be able to understand or tell others why european territory was subject to so many changes in the last centuries .instead , a student should take care to capture all the general ideas , concepts and methods taught in class .concepts and ideas are easier to reuse if you understand them correctly .as a student of business administration i can tell that facts can be very important , and if this is the case you should be very accurate .but in general i would agree , that it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts , than mere facts that you will forget the second you learned them .
