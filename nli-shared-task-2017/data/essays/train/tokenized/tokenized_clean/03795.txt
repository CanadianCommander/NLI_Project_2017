in my opinion , people who are trying try new things and taking risk are more successful than people who are keeping on doing what they know well .first , i will use my own experience to illustrate my opinion , i like to make birthday parties for friends .that means called people , book the restaurant , etc .a month ago , i made a birthday party for a friend of mine , since i m not a risky person with my friends , i did nt choose to make something completely new like strip club or something like that .i made a regular party like i do every year , restaurant and then clubbing .it was supposed to be a suprise but i noticed that my friend guessed my plan before .on the birthday , he was nt suprised at all .i guess if i would have done something different by changing my initial plan , my friend would be more enthousiast .i did nt take the risk of disappointing him .he would be more suprised by something new instead of that i kept on doing the same thing .in the worklife , i m quite different than i m in my private life since i like to take risks , discover new things and improve myself in order to evolve in the company .by taking risk , i avoid being boring and unproductive at work .for example , my boss asked me to do a new software with some specifications .i made all of that with the team , but i wanted to add some improvements that make the software more easier to use for a new user .some of the team members did nt agree with my thought because they wanted to focused on the specifications and nothing else .i took the risk by myself , i did nt tell anyone of my will of adding new features for the software .i added something that was nt asked , i could be fired for that but in the other hand i could get consideration thanks to that .to conclude if you want to evolve in your worklife or even in your social life , i think you have to take risks in order to first , evolve in your company , prevent your life from being boring and discover new possibilities of life .people who are always doing the same thing , do that thing well but they stay at the same level of accomplishment , they can upgrade their skills but not that much if you take risks .
