some people say that the number of automobiles will decrease in a couple of decades .however , i disagree with the statement for the following reasons .fisrt of all , cars are most useful tool for people to move .for example , in 2001 , when i was sophomore in university , i lived in tokyo and i had a travel to hokkaido , the most northen island in japan .i wanted to visit many place with beautiful forest and precious plants , because my major was biology and i was very interested in the diversity of plants in hokkado , most cold realm in our countory .a problem was that there were no means to reach the forest because few people wanted to visit there .then i determined to use a car and i enjoyed my trip with various types of plants .if i could not use cars , i would not have visited the exciting forest .as this example shows , cars satisfy our individual requirment , suggesting use of cars will be inevitable in near future .second , there are possiblity that scientists create new types of cars moving without petroleum .one of major problems about cars is that they use petroleum .using petroleum causes natural environment to be polluted .also , shortage of petroleum in the earth is annoying problem .to address these issue , for example , scientist now develop cars whose fuel is ethanol , a kind of alcohol .we can easily create ethanol from crop , especially cone because of a large amount of cone s supply .scientists are also developing cars moving with electricity from solar energy .this is completely clean and not harmful .although there is many problems to realize these next generations of cars , many countries promote these study and the application will be realized soon .therefore , i disagree with the statement that the number of automobiles will decrease within next two decades .
