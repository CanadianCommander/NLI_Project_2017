first of all , there has to be a definition of `` young  and `` old  .a twenty-year old person will consider himself as being `` old  when he compares his age to that of a newborn .on the other hand , a 70 year-old person will think of the 20 year old person as being `` young  .i assume that the statement on the left thinks of people in their twenites or thirties as `` young people  and that seniors at the age of around 60 are referred to as `` old people  .i believe that it is impossible to make a `` yes  or `` no  decision on that question .of course , the general idea of `` enjoying life  is that of having parties , drinking alcohol , making new friends and not having any concerns about the future .all of these activities are much more typical of younger people than of older people .younger people simply do nt spend too much time thinking about the future , they `` live for the moment  .in that regard , the statement on the left is right .once people have grown , they tend to take on more responsibilities and duties in their lifes .older people have to supply some financial income , maybe not only for themselves , but also for their family .they have to take care of their social life which seems a lot more complicated than in the younger days , and they might also have growing concerns about their health .all of these factors do nt really make it `` fun  to be older .on the other hand , being old also means being wiser .when you ve reached a certain age , you are able to define the true values of life .and generally , these values are not parties , alcohol or superficial friendships .the true values are much more intimate .they are in things like having one best friend , being rewarded at work or just being loved by your partner or your kids .having a loving wife for example can be the best `` fun  you ll ever have in your life , although people normally would nt call it `` fun  , but `` fullfillment  instead .but this detail would lead to another discussion about the definition of `` fun  .my conclusion is , that - just as life does - the definition of `` enjoying life  changes during the years of a lifetime .
