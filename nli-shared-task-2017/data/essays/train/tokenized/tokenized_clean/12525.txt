some say that specializing in one specific subject is valuable for japanese university students .however , i found more advantages that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for japanese university students .there are three advantages to support to have many different type of academic subjects .one reason for my belief is that comparing some subjects are important to study the academic subject .one example of this is that because i am taking international politics at my university , it is much better for me to know different subjects such as ecomics , business and history in order to understand international politics .it becomes me link with other fields to get better understanding for my study .another reason is that it is possible for university students to meet various people who have different backgrounds .if the student could meet each other with various knowledge and experience , they can absorb new ideas and broaden our perspectives .in specific terms , i can consider that i met a student who is studying indian politics and a student who is studying chinese politics through studying international politics .because of different backgrouds , we shared cultural differences and exchanged a lot of information .final reason is that having many opportunities to get a job .for instance , if the student only know one subject , it is difficult to choose many fields of job .on the other hand , if the student have many academic subjects , it is helpful to choose some fields of job .moreover , it is used in practical flexibly .actually , i got a job as an account in japan .i will paln to change my job to be an worker of united nations .considering all of the above factors , comparing different subjects , meeting new people and getting a job are advantageous to choose many academic subjects .thanks to globalization , having many different academic subjects will be much more vital for studnets to understand international issues .
