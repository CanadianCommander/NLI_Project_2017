this statement typically reflects the fight between ideas and facts .as far as i am concerned , learning ideas and concepts is much more useful for a students than learning facts .if i take an experience of mine , that will examplify what i mean .i am currently a student in a great french business school , and particularly focused on corporate finance .i attended scores of theoretical classes , mainly about great financial concepts .for 6 months , i have been a trainee as financial analyst , in mergers & acqusitions , in hsbc .i have quickly come to the conclusion that all the courses i attended were really usefull .i mean that , professionnally , facts concretely do not teach anything , whereas ideas and concepts create those facts and explain them .it is obviously more important to have learned how to valuate a company than to have learened how much coca cola is valuated .moreover , ideas and concepts make one s mind more open .they make one s mental boundaries broader .from a combination of ideas may stem a lot of new ideas , innovation and creation .but hardly nothing stems from facts , except facts and history .facts are worth in themselves , whereas the worth of concepts and ideas results from the innovation they allow .eventually , some facts are clearly important to know and understand things .but to really and fully understand the french revolution in 1789 , for instance , one must have previously learned all the ideas and concepts prevailing in the revolution , such as the absolute monarchy or the emertging philosophy of `` les lumieres  .the revolution is not just a succession of facts , and just learning the very dates of it is obmitting the true essence of the revolution , what it really implied , the consequences it had for the life at that day , but also fur us , french people , today .
