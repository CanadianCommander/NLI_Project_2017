i think each age has its plasure times and memories .during the childhood , teens years , young people & oldduring childhood you have the chance to do anything and no one will say why ?they will say he is trying to learn , let him try it so he will know what is it like drink a hot cup of tea he will cray becouse he did not know its hot , what is hot ?so next time he will avoid it and when he cray his mom and dad will run to him and huge him .he will have all the interisting .he will buy toys , games and tudybears .he will sleep with his mother and father .teens and yong people usully have the most good times they enjoy the most becose they will start to under stand everything , try everything if they have the corige ( brave heart ) for the bunji jumping , scopa diving , have alots of frineds , join a collage , drive the cars , lots and lots of enteristing things which old people can do it but not like young people .old people spicelly when they retier they like to go in a croze or in a trip around the world , but the acttivities that they will had are not the same of the youngs .young people have cornucopia of fun , experiens , friends .the butiy being old is to see your son or dughetr having a buby , to see his smill , to see your old wife/husben beside you smileing to you graping your hand .i think young people have a wild life but when they become old they have lots of love .the most important is to know how to live each period correctly .enjoy each second becose ya each second you will lose are aint gonna come back .good bless every one
