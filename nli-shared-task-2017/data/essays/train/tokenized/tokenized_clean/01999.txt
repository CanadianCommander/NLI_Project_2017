some students learn only facts , while others are able to understand the ideas and the concepts that derive from those facts .according to me , that i am a student and so i m really concerned about this , only learning a fact without learning something from it it s unuseful , as students are nt memory machine but they have also emotions and some facts can touch them .for example , if i have to follow a lesson , which speaks about the progressive movement , obviously i will learn all the fact that had derived from this movement and i will be interested in learning it , but only this will not satisfy me .in fact i think that it will be more useful and more interesting if i can go inside this movement and understand which are the reasons why this movement was created , what was the background of that period , what was the most important thing that pushed people who belonged to this movement to act in that way . ..otherwise , i do nt learn nothing that can help me to improve myself , as i ve only learned a series of facts without having understood them .another reasons is that , if students are taken inside the facts , they will be more involved and so they can appasionate to it and will follow every lessons paying more attention .for this reason , i think that seeing films which speak about a particular event , is a thing which can help students to learn this event , as films do nt describe only a fact , but allow us to share the emotions of every character who is involved in the event .in conclusion , i think that only learning a fact is a void learning as it does nt help people to improve themselves , so i will ever try , everytime that i will approach to learn something , to understand ideas and concepts at the basis .
