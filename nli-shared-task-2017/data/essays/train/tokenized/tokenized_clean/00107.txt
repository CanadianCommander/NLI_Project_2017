this statement is true and false at the same time .first of all , young people are interested in their own life and how to make it better for them .for instance , a high school graduate will focus on attending college and afterwards taking a job and make a family .he wo nt care about a social problems in his society and will say : `` i must focus on my own life .i do nt have time for these things  .second , in most of young people , they tend to have fun instead of working very hard .to illustrate , a high-school student who get a summer holiday will think primarily about how to make it enjoyable .he thinks about travelling abroad or going to beach .he wo nt usually think about giving some of his allowance to a charity organization .but , however , it does nt apply for each individual person or community .nowadays , a lot of youths support charity organization .for example , in saudi arabia , a lot of youths support the charity organizations with money .thus , satisfying the demands of poor families in saudi arabia .another example is , in ramadan ( the season of fasting for saudis ) , there are a lot of youths providing dates and water to the drivers in the traffic signs in order to break their fast .in conclusion , generally speaking , this statement is true although it can not be applied on each individual young person .
