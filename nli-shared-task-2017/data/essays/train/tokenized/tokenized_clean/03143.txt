while man is growing he learns a lot of information about how to behave , how to live , how to survive in the society , which is good and which is bad , because all are essential while growing .in this way the education is also very important to a person .beginning from childhood he learnt several things .by studying different fields of subjects he can get a variety of knowledge about different topics .like if he studies history he knows about past historical stories , and while learning science he have a knowledge about health and reasons for scientifical things , like that if we study different areas then we can get more knowledge related to all fields .that is the reason childrens are studying in the school days in different subjects .upto high school education it gives all the basic principles presented in related subjects , while coming to higher education it is differs and confining to less subjects because we want to specialize in some particular areas which we like most .then if a student is interested in maths he takes that subject and studying it , and another student interested in the other subject and takes that subject as a major subject and acquires proficiency in that area .in my opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects upto graduation level .why because upto that level we get some idea about all basic principles behind in it .as the studies go on as like master s degree than it is better to take a single subject rather than taking several subjects .that is the time to be specialize in specific subject .why because by studying all the subjects at that time also there is no use , if we become familier with one subject we can find new things which is very useful to us .finally i agree with the opinion that it is better have broad knowledge on many academic subjects upto graduation level which results in good results .
