since humans exist , one point has always been discussed : advantages and disadvantages to be young or old .once again , we are going to try to determine whether young people or old people enjoy the most life .before starting , it is important to precise what means young and what means old .for example , i have been treated as amn old person by my sister during the christmas holidays and i am only 23 .for this essay , we wil consider that someone is young until his first official work day .young people are more able to enjoy life than old people .as a matter of fact , they can project to do whatever they want without thinking to the consequences of their acts .you can go out all night long and forget going at school in the morning .you will not be fired for this .however , if an employee is doing the same , it is going to be harder to provide good excuses .basically , when you are young you depend on your parents and you can be sure that they are going to help as much as they can .so you can try .amn old person is going to consider the point totally differently .first of all , this person can be responsible of a family , of a team , of a company .it gives him the obligation to be ready 24 hours a day for them .in contrary to this , how can you enjoy your life if you have just your time to spend .in fact , the world is crual and gives the power to enjoy to people that have the less the time to use it .enjoying life is very easy if you have enough money to do what you want to do .unfortunately , only old people who work for years can allow them to enjoy their like .traveling around the world , going to the stade de france for the world football cup final , buy the last ipod . ..as i said , it is very easy to enjoy life .nevertheless , it is not free and it seems that only old people are able to do this .all our life , we want to be what we are not .when we are at school , we want the driving licence to go out during the week end .when we are student , we want to work in a good and reliable company in the way to have a family and buy a house .when we are employees , we fancy being in retire . ..we just need to be us .
