the statement states that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better then in depth knowledge in one specific subject .on the one hand the broad knowledge gives a large picture on the issue , on the other hand specilization in one subject gives an edge in the area specific to it .however broad knowledge is better but being a specialist does nt lessen its importance .firstly , having knowledge about more then one academic subject or in fact many academic subjects helps a student or teacher to get a more larger view and the ability to see the things from more broader perspective .for ex. a person knowing chemistry and biology can definitely tell better about the details of chemical reactions taking place inside the body and its effect on it as well .secondly , having broad knowledge helps in correlating the information from various subjects and thus enables onself to give a more holistic view of different subjects related to each other .for instance , physics and mathematics are subjects which are related with each other .instead of merely stating the laws , if it can be proved mathematically also then it will help the audience to have better understanding of the law and thus can be easily grasped .finally , having broad knowledge gives an edge in making things interesting instead of just plain load of information from a specific subject .for ex a lecturer knowing science , maths and history can definitely deliver a better and interesting lecture then a specialist of one field .having said about broad knowledge , it should not be overlooked the importance of specialist knowledge which is necessary when it requires to have indepth knowledge rather than just a good knowledge about many subjects .for ex. a zeology professor explaining intricasies about the nervous system of an animal will be expected to deliver in depth knowledge about the minutiae details which obviously requires specific knowledge and not broad knowledge .in the conclusion it can be said that it is true that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better but that doesnt lessen the importance of specialize knowledge in one specific subject by any factor .
