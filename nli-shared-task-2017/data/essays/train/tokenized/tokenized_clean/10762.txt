in my opinion the statement is true .if you think about it you will recognize that the risk of failing might be very high but if you want to be successful you have to take a risk .if you just do not try you might regret it later .take madonna as example .she was one of the first woman in music business who appeard on videos not wearing much .people were not used to that way of presenting themselves and there were many discussions about it .many wanted to permit the videos and her music .there were a lot of negative articles in the world s press but it also brought her a lot of attention which was , by the way both , positive and negative .but that was not the only thing she tried .she also sang about topics like abortion which were tabus at that time .in the end that is what made her famous besides her music .she tried out new things and risked a lot .she could have failed because you never know if people are ready for it or not but she succeeded .now she is not only one of the most famous musicans of all times but she also earns a lot of money .maybe this is not a typical exmaple if you compare it to people with innovative business ideas like henry ford but in my opinion it fits very well with the topic anyways .if she had not tried she might be a well-known artist by now as well but she would probably be one out of many and not the one .all in all everyone has to decide for him or herself weather he wants success or weather he wants security and be one of many .
