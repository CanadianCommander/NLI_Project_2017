i agree wit the presented statement .the express purpose of advertisement is to induce a change in consumer behavior towards favoring the product presented .most advertisement arises from the need to create product differentiation - a process by which products that are in essence the same ( for example , two hamburgers , both are made of bread , meat , cheese , etc . .. )are presented to consumers as different ( wendy s , mcdonald s , burger king , etc . .. ) .product differentiation is necessary in markets rueld by monopolistic competiton : several but not infinate suppliers , demand is not the only determinant of price .in order to charge a higher price , a given supplier has to modify his product in the eyes of a customer : in comes advertisement .soda manufacturers have developed many brands ( coke vs. pepsi ) , small modifications on existing brands ( coke with cherry , etc . .. )and have to keep advertising to create the impression on customers that a branded product is different from , say , walgreens-brand cola , and pharmaceutical companies have to convince customers that advil is superior to generic ibuprophen .by its very essence , product differentiation has to make a product appear better than the competition , desite the fact that they are the same .beyond product differentiatiob , advertisement is used to introduce new products .new products have to overcome consumer s initial guarding against the unknown using techniques such as celebritiy sponsors , or displaying other costumers satisfied with the product ( or wearing the product with a smile ) .the implied message is , you will be like a celebrity or you will have the same smile or be as satisified as the portrayed individual .this in essence makes the product seem better than it really is : there is no way a given product by itself can guarantee my satisfaction , as i have to provide a response , determined by my own notion of satisfaction .part of the purpose of advertisment is to modify this notion .advertisement is also prone to `` reporter bias  , that is , only good or positive results and characteristics are advertised and negative or unfavorable results are of course hidden .if the battery life is poor , no mention is made of battery life .for well known health hazards , warnings have been introduced to the advertisement , which is an admission of the fact that the product is being portrayed as beneficial ( marlboro can attract women , according to commercials , but of course can lead to cancer ) .now , a product can be advertised in a way that is more honest an up-front with the cusatomer .usually , this only happens when this is required by law ( for example , drugs ) .however , the very nature of advertisement leads to down-playing the importance of these apparent flaws .in all drugs commercials , mention of side effects comes well at the end of the commercial , are of course spoken over a powerful image of a satisfiedsenior playing with his grandchildren , and spoken quickly and in a soft tone of voice .the underlying message : yes , drowsiness , but who cares when you can play with your grandkids ?
