i think it is not easy to answer because you have to respect several aspects .on the one hand i think this statement is correct , because today there are some people who think only on theirselves .they think that they are the most important person and if somebody needs help they say : ask somebody else .this is a very hard opinion and i think ( and i hope ) that this is only a minority of our population .on the other hand i think that especially some old people have a wrong opinion .they often speak about an unfriendly and unpolite youth , but i think this is not a correct opinion .i think that this is caused by those people i have talked about in the first paragraph .i can tell about my friends and me .we are a group of five people and we work in a home for old people .there , we do lots of things to help these people to have a nice day .we stay there two times in month and the old people are very happy to see us every time .another example is my big sister .she is cooking in my old school for lots of pupils with some other parents , because the village has not enough money to pay for a good food .so many parents decided to do this job on their own to give the pupils a good meal .i think this is a good help in the comunities .what is important to say too , is that there are many pupils who helps other pupils with their homework and learn with them for tests or other things like that .this is also a kind of help for others .at least i can say that i think that the majority of our population is doing lots of things for their communities .of course it can always be more , but if everybody helps a little bit , i think it is a good start for the future .
