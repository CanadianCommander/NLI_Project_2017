i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects is important a student up to his secondary school level , that is up to his ten plus two level .becuase we should be familier about all basical scinces .it is impartent to inculcate body functioning , and body cleaning , so we need biology .one should learn about the nature and environment in which he living .basical mathamatical caliculations are impartent in day-to-day life .a person should be imported that how he should behave in the society , what are his rights and responsibilities , so he should learn social studies .there is multidimensional devlopments are occuring in various fields of study .there are also different interests and talents exist in each person .it is difficult to decide a careere for a person inthe early age .so every one should be familier with many acadamic subjects .on the other hand dealing with many number of subjects at the same time is very difficult thing .even there are more number of sub fields existing in a group today .for example let us take technology .in technology there are many number of branches existing like computer scince , electronics , mechanical and civil .each field is different frome other .one ca nt reach the apex in every field .to have good knowledge on a perticular field , it is better to devote entire time to get mastery of that perticular subject .doing reaserches in order to get practical knowledge is impartent .so in my opinoin , reading many acadamics in secondary schoole level , and reading a single specialized subject from under graduate level is better to one .
