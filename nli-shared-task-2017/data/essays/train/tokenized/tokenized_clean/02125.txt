even though the heads of companies said they are very reliable in making the advertisements , i totally agree that most of them are nt satisfying consumers  expectation .i d like to give you a couple of reasons to support this opinion .in the first place , they including ceos and ads makers are trying to make their products seem better than product s reality because if they do that , they can make more money .for example , there is a car commercial which is shot in the paradise .if they do that , people , most of consumers , would expect that we ll be there if we buy this car .as a result of this , by shoting the commercial in ideal place , the car company would make much of income .second , i want to argue my opinion as using current situation .many countries , especially developed which , the rate of asking refund or exchange is increasing in most famous companies .this situation is not only happened in famous companies but also small , develping companies .why is it happening ?i think that because of unreality of advertisement make this situation .in addition , if the companies did that againg and again , they will be charged more money and make this worse .i ve read the article about this problem , in which the expert said since many company are pouring their much of money in commercial and ads , they ca nt afford to use their money to improve their products .so it will even cause the situation worse than now .from that kinds of account i asserted my opinion .moreover , as i wrote it , i think the companies which waste their money in meaningless thing should their money in the good reasons such as improving the quality of their product and making new polic
