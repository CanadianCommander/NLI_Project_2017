one need to spend at least few hours to help their communities , which ultimately helps in increasing the living standards .i agree with the statment that young people are not spending enough time to help their communities .why i am holding that opinion is because of these reasons .first younger people are now more concentrating on their studies , which is mandatory in the modern life .because of the cut throat competition in the modern world , they need to be good in their courses , obviously it means that they have to spend more time on their course .so they have less chances of concentrating on the communities welfare .second younger generation people are more attracted towards fashion , which is ruling the campuses now a days .for that they are spending a lot of time on clothes and jewellery .it one of the reason why they are not involving in the community work .third younger people are more interested in video games and other common sports .because sports gives more fun , which might be one of the reason .why this phenomena is happening because they are not feeling responsible for the communities welfare .it happened in my case when i was studying i am not at all intersted in community work , all the time i spent on my university work and sports .that time i am not aware of the community benefits .slowly i realised the benefits of the community work in improving the living standards .in short , younger people are not spending time on community welfare , but by the guidance they will know the importance .
