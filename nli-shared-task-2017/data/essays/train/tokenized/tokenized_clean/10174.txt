in my opinion , i think that it is better for undergraduate students to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .what is more , it is better for graduate students to specialize in one specific subjuect .my reasons are lised as follows .in the first place , the majoritey of undergraduate students face the problom of finding jobs when they graduate from the university or college , except the students who plan to pursue the higher degree .if they have broad knowledge of many academic , it means that they have more oppotunitise to recieve a good job .on the other hand , it is obvious that undergraduate students just recieve a fundational education in the university .with the broad knowledge background , the undergraduate students will become move competitive in the job market .as far as the graduate students , since their tasks is be outstanding in one special field , and they have not enough energy to study deeply in various fields .therefore , it is suitable for a graduate students to specialize in one specific subject .as far as i am concerned , i always believe that a graduate student is a person who is so intellegent that can contribute to the field of science which he or she is studing .ademittedly , having broad knowledge of various academic subjects is definitely benefacial for graduate students to achieve success in his special field .as a result , it is greatly useful for everyone to devote himself of herself to enlarge the sphere of knowledge .taking into account of what have been discussed above , we may reach the conclusion that the undergraduate students should have broad knowledge of many academic , and the graduate students are more suitable to study in one specific subject .
