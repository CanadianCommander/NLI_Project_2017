there are to much products in the world .so it is imporsible to count them .although some product are used in the same way , they made by different company than they will looks different .i strongly agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i have some exprience of my own .for example , one day i was shopping with my mother .then we see there is a mp3 player it looks very cool .of course , i will ask my mother to buy it for me .than my mother said it just looks cool , it not useful than you think my son .but i still not give up , i said we can ask the seller the mp3 is good or not .of course you will get the answer - the player is good to use .than i get the mp3 .after i used it 3 days , it doest work any more .i told my mother than she said am i right ?why do nt you believe me that time .so , if do nt want to buy some just looks good ?we can get some information form your friend whose have a product you want to buy .because your firend has used the product for many times than he/she konws it is good not not .and if you do nt has some friends have some products you want to buy .you can buy the product by some famous companies , like sony , microsoft and any others companys .because they famous , that means they makes good products .so , buy things do not just look they are faces .ask help for the seller it is good or not is also not a good way .we can ask the seller some information from it .but do not ask good or nor
