in this world there are three kinds of people who are very much responsible for their own happiness , problems .they do not want to take advises from the others .they do nt want to share their problems with the others .the three kinds of people are young people , middle age people and old people .here we discuss about the young people and the old people .is young people are enjoying the life or the old people are enjoing the life .from the statement , i agree with it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because the young people are in the right age to enjoy .they can go anywhere they want but the older people can not .from the morning till night the young people are enjoying a lot in sleeping .i.e. wake up late in the morning some people wake up early in the morning so that they can do some work outs where as old people can not .in the second reason i want to specify about the young people enjoying in the bikes and cars .as the young people go to colleges by bikes and cars .the college enjoyment is different where the old people can not enjoy the college life .the young people own there personal bike and cars through which they can enjoy the whole roads while travelling and they can also travell to long distances with their friends .in the third reason i want to discuss about how the young people are enjoying in the night .after the college hours and in weekends i.e. in the evening hours the young people enjoy a lot in going to movies , pubs , discos , and some weekend programs or functions .where as the old people connot enjoy all these parties in the evening hours and in the weekends , they just call upon their friends to their homes and can just have gettogether in a closed rooms .finally i would like to say that older people are not much energitic that the young ones .in their days i.e. when the older people were young they used to enjoy a lot , here it dos nt matter .here we are just discussing about how the young people are enjoying than the older ones .in conclusion , i would rather like to say that young people are dynamic , energitic , and can enjoy the life more than older people .in every aspect of life young people are enjoying the l
