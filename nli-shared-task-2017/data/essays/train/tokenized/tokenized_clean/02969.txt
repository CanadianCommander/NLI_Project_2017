i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .many young people nowadays do not pay enough attention to other peoples needs but are preoccupied with their own problems and activities .on the other hand they use facilities given by their communities like youth centers and sports facilities and even schools which are mostly run by the community .this stresses the point that many young people only take instead of taking and giving back .they do not seem to realize that most of the facilities they use every day are run or at leat supported by their communities .from these points one can draw the conclusion that young people should defenitely do something in order to give back to their communities .examples of what they could do for their community are on the one hand helping to keep all these facilities they use everyday running thus helping to keep places like parks , public transport and sports facilities clean and intact .on the other hand they should also see what they can do for other people and their interests and needs .young people could e.g. help older people with their shopping , go to elderly homes and read books or newspapers to the people or play games with them .that way they would socalize with other groups and give back to the community what they give to young people .also , young people should try to contribute to local issues like politics and demonstrations in order to support their community in important topics .through these activities they would improve the living standard everyone is getting profit from now and that they are getting profit from in the future .to draw a conclusion young people should give more of their spare time to their community in order to socialize and get into contact with other groups of people and also to give back part of the effort adults make to have the younger enjoy their environment and facilities .
