i am agree , becasue when sucessful people take risks to do something else , they discover that they are able to do new things , and they can help another people with their problems or with their proyects .if i know that i am sucessful in typing wihtout seeing , it does nt mean that i am going to be only concentrated in this matter because that will not help me to take a risk and try to do something differente .that means i would never know that i am able to do new things very well .one example is when i was younger , i wanted to be a teacher , but a i was afraid , because i did not know what grade level i will be teaching , becasue when i was a college student , i used to practice second grade , and it was the grade level that i liked , but i thougth about it , if i wo nt take the risk , i wo nt find out how well i will be as a teacher in a high grade level .so i took the risk and i got a fourth grade level and i had a wounderful class .all my students were promoted to the next grade level , which means they were succesful at the end of the school year .that showed me , that if i would nt take the risk i wouldn know i could be a good teacher in a high grade level .i mean , higher than second grade .so i recommened to the people to take the risk and try new things rather to be there stock in one thing forever .the new things that you can do well , will help you to be succesful in differents fields , and that will help you to have a better way to live and enjoy your job or jobs .
