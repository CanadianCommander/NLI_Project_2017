i am inclined to agree with the statement that the people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful .i have certains reasons to agress with this statement which i would discuss later in my essays .i would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risks might not get the success in1st attempt , sometimes people need to attempt multiple times .the main reason for this my view is that i believe in `` more risk , more gain  philosophy .if i decide to get into some new business/idea , which nobody has tried , i need compartively more resources in terms of money , time and effort to purse this new venture .there is a chance that this new venure could fail , but on the positive note if that business/idea succeds , i would have a tremendous potentail to make money in this new business as i will not have much competition .i will give an example of john chambers , ceo of a networking company .this company was traditionally in the business of selling networking devices .as its buinsess became more matured and competition increased , john decided to take some risk and expanded into telephony business and became successful in this new business .this company ranks as number one in telephony buinsess .the 2nd reason for my view is that unless i venture into unknown terrotories i will not know what lies there .as a human , we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarntee that there is no risk in what we are doing today .my brother has a gift business and he was very comfortable in that buinsess .i insisted him to try export business , though he was initially reluctant but he tried and became successful .in conclusion , i believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to scuccess which we should try .
