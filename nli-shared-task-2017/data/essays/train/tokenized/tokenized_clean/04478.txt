fewer cars due to increased use of public transportationi fully agree with the given statement that the number of cars will reduce within the next twenty years .firstly , a lot of people will not be able to afford gas anymore .by virtue of the exploitation of natural resources such as petroleum the price of those products will increase even more than it already did .a car will become something like luxury for many people .this causes a natural decline of the number of cars on the streets .besides , the world population will raise enormously .in twenty years will propably have almost ten billion people living all over the globe .as a result , traffic will increase .not only in cities but also in remote areas because you need more space for all the people .traffic jams and more accidents will occur more often especially in cities .in order to avoid this chaos many people will have to use public transportation like bus or subway .another reason for my opinion that there will be fewer cars in use is the lack of parking spaces in big cities .every huge town in the world as a problem with providing enough room for the cars .in manhattan the cars have to be stacked and in san francisco the prices for a parking lot in downtown are hardly affordable to keep the people from parking there .in addition to this , state governments will have to pass laws which will restrict traffic .due to overpopulation and enviromental pollution owing to heavier traffic , the number of cars allowed on the streets at the same time will have to be regulated to stop further destruction of the planet .last but not least , we will have new technologies concerning public transportation .i am pretty sure we will have faster trains , new inventions to travel and the prices will decrease .a reason for lower prices is that more people will use public transportation out of the reasons i mentioned and explained above . .
