the statement given is rather black and white .i would although agree with the tendence , that successful people are able and have the courage to dare new things .and obviously not daring anything new or unusal doesnt promise any success .an ability which might lead to sucess is the wisdom to know in which situation it is needed to do what is familiar and when a new step can be dared .i would say this is a possibility of using resources and energie effective .some time it might be wise to do things which are familiar to do and doesnt consume money or time for research .but than it is nessesary to dare something new .for instance for a company which produces products or servises , it can be advisable to lance a small range of products first , till they got a position in the market and a name among their costumers .after that they have gained ressourses to do steps in new directions , generally spoken .taking risks needs a personality that dares to fail .an experiment can go wrong and in that case a desicionmaker needs to carry the responsability for it .i think the ability of taking risks is definitivly a positive and creative one and needed to reach goals and success .it is a skill for leading positions .but as i mentioned the more important skill is to be able to distinguish situations where its advisable to chose either the known or the new action .sucess altough could be understood differently .goals could be set differently .in the case the goal is not an economic one , and for instance to gain experience , than is trying new things and experiments defenitly an advantege .
