it is generally agreeded that a way of succeed in life is to take risks .living one s life fearfully is know as a loose of time .people who do not dare experimenting new things are said to be coward or loosers .i think that this question is debatable and that we have to be carefull with stereotypes .it is undoubtable that sometimes in life you have to move on ; change your way of life to succed .for instance , two years ago i had to leave my home , in paris , to aix en provence , in southern france .i have been accepted in a political science school to pursue my cursus .i was afraid of living alone in another city but i take the risk and move to this new place .nowadays i am happy of having done the right choice .even if there are positive point in taking risks rather than doing what you already know sometimes it could be risky .risktakers are often self-confident .my grandmother always says that too much confident is dangerous .in my opinion taking risks becomes dangerous when you loose sens of reality ; when you think that all is easy .sometimes daring new things turns well , but you have to keep in ; ind that also it could turn bad .for instance , my aunt was tired of her job , one day she decides to leave thinking of all the exciting new experiences she would experiement in a new job .unfotunatly it was not so easy to find a new job and she was unemployed during 3 months .the risk she takes had tremendous consequences .to conclude i want to say that taking risk is a good think but it has not be systematic .fear is a normal feeeling and it contibutes to self protection .a balance between daring new thigs and living carefully would be a ggod compromise .
