if you open a textbook , for example a math one used in the past at school , it s quite easy to notice that each theory and concept is followed by a practical example that explains and allows the student to get a better understanding of the cited rule .in fact i personally think that this is the way students learn better and easier .a concept on itself without an example sometimes does nt have much sense and it can be difficult to memorize it .for istance , there are some subjects that have no meanings without facts and i believe history is one of these ones .a student ca nt just have the idea of what is `` the second world war  without knowing the real historical events concerned to it .it would be an empty information .in my opinion history can be defined as a facts based subject where the ideas or concepts are almost irrelevant .although what i ve just said it depends much on the kind of subject you are going to study .some of them strictly require something more than the idea , meanwhile for others can be useless because it s already clear by itself .facts such as dates , examples , references give probably a hand to the student at first when he approaches to study something new , once the student has understood well i agree with the general opinion which is that facts are secondary to the idea and they may lose their importance and can be forgotten .as a result learning facts is helpful but it s not all .even a single fact does nt have sense if we do nt understand the reason we are studying it .in summary it s important to have a balance between these two kind of learning because only doing this a student can really reach a high level of knowledge .
