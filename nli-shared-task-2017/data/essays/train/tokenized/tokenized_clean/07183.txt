most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .many compnies adveritise in order to make lots of money .their purpose is to make money and their purpose is to make the company s image good on the consumers .first of all , when i bought the shampoo that was advertised on television seemed so good .they did show how the hair was shining after they washed their hair .thereby , i went to the store and bought one of the shampoo that was advetised .unfortunately , for my hair was no good .it did not make my hair as shining as i expected .moreover , it made my hair more oily that i had to wash my hair more often .i think it was because they used a famous actress that it motivated me more to buy the product .for instance , this actress is using this product so let me follow her .in a way , it is like copying .also , i made a mistake which that actress might had hair that was perfectly fitted with the shampoo .second of all , when they advertise about certain food , it looks more delicious on television .what i found out from my friend who works in an advertisement company was that she told me they put something inside so it shows more greasy and more colorish .i did found some food such as frozen food were not that delicious than i had expected .it all had reasons for it .maybe the sound might make advertisements much better than the real product .i think there are several factors allow products to look good .first factor was they use an famous actor or actress so people want to use it .it is more like copying or it is more like this actor is using it so i better use it .second factors are sound and backgrounds .when people advertise they do add some sounds or ingredients so it seems that products look good itself but it is not .it is the surroundings that make the product good itself .
