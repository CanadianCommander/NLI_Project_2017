i disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .i think having a broad field of knowledge is as important as specializing in one particular subject .having a broad knowledge of many academic field only allows one to know the shallower part of each subject .one who does not specialize in any field can only be deemed as `` amateur  , not `` professional  .a person with broad knowledge in many academic fields but no deep insights in any subject can never design gadgets as well as professional engineers do ; they can never navigate planes as well as professional aviators do ; they can never compose music pieces as remarkably as musicians do . ..hence , we need people who specialize in one specific subject to make our world a better place and to run our society smoothly .however , specializing in one one particular subject has drawbacks as well .for example , in singapore , the universities place too much emphasis on specialized knowledge .that leads to a work force that is rather narrow-minded .as a result , singaporeans tend to be less creative and less likely to think out of the box .also , people with different academic field might have difficulty in communicating with each other , making people more isolated .on the contrary , the tertiary education in the united states emphasizes on both specialized and broad knowledge of the students .it makes people more prepared to make sound dicisions in complicated circumstances which involves different academic fields .for instance , a politician who specializes in politics only will not be able to make sound sound policies in environmental problems .it is also likely that he might take the lobbists  words blindly .hence , it is also important for one to have a broad range of knowedge .in conclusion , i think it is equally important for one to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and to specialize in one specific subject .
