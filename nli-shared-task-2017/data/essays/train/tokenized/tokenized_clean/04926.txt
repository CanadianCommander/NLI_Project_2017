people have their own ideas about whether traveling alone is better than traveling by a tour guide or not .in my opinion , the best way to travel is by alone in that it can be free to tour places and easily make new firends in the new place .first , traveling alone enbles us to feel free to move on tour site .some people may think that moving new places alone is dangerous because we do not know about the places .in my opinion , however , traveling alone can benefit us to have more chances to see sight seeing .for example , if i tour with other people on scheduled , i can not see museums and churches that i wante to visit exept determined sites .then i do not feel satisfied with the tour .in this way , i can say that traveling along give us more chances to visit than traveling in a group .second , when it comes to making new friends , moving alone greatly contributes to making it possible .it is generally agreed that traveling in a group is difficult to make new people as they have to move scheduled the sighteeing sites .however , when we are free we can meet other people that may be traveling people or local residents .if they are residents , we can get more detail information on the place .it will be more helpful to take a trip alone than traveling in a group led by a tour guide .to sum up , traveling alone is better way to treveling in a group by a tour guide in that we can have more chances to visit freely favorite places and meet new friends who can give useful information about the new places .all things considered , i can definitely say that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way as the advanteges of traveling alone mentioned aboved .
