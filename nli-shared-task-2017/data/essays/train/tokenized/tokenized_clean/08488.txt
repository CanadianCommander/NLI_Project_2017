i , agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .young children enjoy their life to a full extant .they dont have any responsibilities on them .they play and have fun with their friends .they dont have any burdens and are usually stress free .they are always with smiling faces and by looking at them any one can be relieved from their tensions .they are always joyful , they try to entertain others through their fun filled plays .they always are very creative and quick at imagining things .they usually pose some questions which parents some times feel in answering .they try to explore new things with things around them with their creative mind .they usually like stories of commics , and stories of tales through which they can know what is good and what is bad .they love watching cartoons because they feel them to be funny , they also learn lot from those cartoons .some are very much interested in games .they play lot of fun filled games .they can refresh their mind and also do excersice to their brain and bodyif they are very good at games , they can also participate in national level games and bring honour to their school and family .they can also participate in many cultural events that take place in school or in their neighbour hood .by this they can entertain people .and also entertain themselves .they feel very happy for their small success .but , older people because of their hectic life and too many responsibilities dont have enough time to enjoy to a full extant .they hardly get time during weekends to enjoy with family .they can refresh their mind only in the night after coming from their office by listening to music and by watching television .so , yonger people enjoy life more than older peole , as they have much leisure time and are not usually burdened with too much responsibilities .
