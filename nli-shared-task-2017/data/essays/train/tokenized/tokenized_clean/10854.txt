i agree with this argument , and i think it is very important not just for students but for all of us to first of all understand the basic ideas and concepts and then to learn facts .a good comprehension of the basics is important because the ideas and concepts actually make up the facts .therefore for anyone to learn the facts it is imperative they have a proper grasp of all the factors that go in it s making .it is a fact that physical exercise is very important for the human body .now if the student just learns that , it will not have much relevance and will not really contribute to anything that is productive .on the other hand when the student understands why it is important --- the ideas behind that particular philosophy it will be much more relevant and thus more meaningful .the student can understand how physical exercise releases stress , how it increases a persons well being by altering chemicals in the brain etc .physical exercise in the form of a team sport teaches people to be able to interact and cooperate and work together .thus the fact will make much more relevance .another example is the fact that it is much more difficult to breathe at higher elevations .it is very important to understand why it is so .if i were planning to be a mountaineer for example , i would be able to deal with the whole situation much better if i understood that air pressure is much more at higher elevation
