i would agree with the given statement , but only to a certain extend .i consider it true that in order to have success , one has to try things that are new and innovative in at least one aspect .but , on the other hand , one has to apply such skills as he posseses in order to get the best outcome possible out of his actions .there are examples of people trying new things , not achieving anything .vincent van gogh is one of these .he did something highly innovative , according to standards and taste of his time , without having any success in his life .on the other hand , there are examples of people merely copying an idea or a product who are enjoying immediate success .`` studivz  , the german version of american `` facebooks  , an internet domain where students and other young people create an internet profile of themselves and share friends , is a perfect example : the inventors of `` studivz  copied the whole idea of facebooks .the only new , innovative thing they accomplished was transferring it to germany , where it had immediate success .of course , there is a new aspect added to the original idea in transferring the concept to a different country , but it is by no means a genuine idea .to my eyes , these two examples show that the given statement is rather general and superficial , implying that successful people are innovative whereas the unsuccessful ones are not .success is certainly dependent on a variety of factors besides the idea being new , such as fashion , skill , fundings , etc .i doubt there is a formula , a certain way to success .nonetheless , the given statement s truth lies in stressing the importance of new ideas for being succesful .in my opinion , the key to success is to be innovative , but not necessarily by trying a completely new thing or do something that surpasses one s own skills .rather , one should carefully consider options , wait for the best moment to come forth with a new idea and think of the best way of issueing this new idea to the market .
