i agree with the statement : `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  because young people have a good health .they also live their lives without difficult responsabilities .on the other side , older people feel tired to enjoy their lives .i believe that young people live their lives happily .young people have the opportunity to do whatever they want because they have excellent health .for example , they can run outside when it is cold .they will not get fiver because they are strong .furthermore , they can eat anything what they want .consequently , they enjoy their lives because they can visit any country and eat different kind of food .young people live without difficult responsabilities .they do not need to be worried about to work hard in order to earn a great amount of money to pay their billes .they are happy to earn enough money to buy simple things .furthermore , they only think about their personal goals .for example , to study in good universities with fun people .on the other side , old people are tired to enjoy their lives because they have huge problems that they need to resolve every day .they have problems with their hearts and stomaches .consequently , they are not able to receive bad news or eat in any place .they also have financial problems because they do not earn enough money to enjoy their lives .in conclusion , i think that young people enjoy their lives than older people because they have good health .they have good opportunities to do many activities .however , old people suffer because they have many problems which they need to resolve .
