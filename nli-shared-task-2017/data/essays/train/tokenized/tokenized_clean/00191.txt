nowadays many people look for ways in order to decrease the number of cars in use .although i would like to see that quantity of automobiles on decreases , i do not believe that this is a possible trend for the near future .simply speaking , there are more incentives for people to buy and use cars than there are reasons to abandon them .i will try to make a short list of these incentives .first of all , the population on earth is growing continuously , which means that there are many new people who want to have cars .as a result of huge advertising campaigns carried out by automobile firms which want to maximize their profits , a social image has been created for cars .people now think that a car improves their mobility and is an indicator of their socio-economic status .moreover , young people also want to have their own cars , which makes them `` cool  .as a result , the demand for new cars is very high in almost every country on teh world .another trend which would avoid a decrease in the number of cars is the unpopularity of mass transit systems .since the cities are growing constantly and funds of governments and local administration can not grow as rapidly as cities , it becomes harder to travel within the city using the overcrowded mass transit systems .therefore , many people prefer to have a car and use it especially in the busy hours of the day .due to the fascinating technological advancements , it becomes easier for people to buy a new car , because technological advancements enable a decrease in prices .bank credits and other kinds of financial assistance are offered to people who want to have cars and most people use these opportunities to have a new car and keeping the older one for other members of the family .in the early 21st century , it is now widely accepted that a nuclear family has more than one car , sometimes even all members have their own car : another inclination which hardens a worldwide decrease in the number of cars .the continuous growth of population coupled with the strong social image of automobiles , unpopularity of mass transit systems and price decreases indicate that a decrease in the quantity of automobiles is not possible for the near future .considering the environmental dangers of having moer cars , on the other hand , governmental and non-governmental organizations should seek and promote options other than cars .
