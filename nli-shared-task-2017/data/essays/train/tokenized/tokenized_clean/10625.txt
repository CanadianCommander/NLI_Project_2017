i really do not agree with that statement .i have made a lot of travels with groups and alone and i have strong reasons to prefer hanging by myself .first of all , whenever you go somewhere with a group you have to move by the schedules that a tour guide or an agency already made for you .you are not free to get up at the time you want or visit other places than the expected ones .so , by the end of the trip you will never know if you really knew a new place or visited touristics sights .secondly , people in groups do not usually show respect for each other .what is more , they are mainly formed by an agency than by particular interests .in this way , you are forced to hang around with people you might not choose to be specially a close friend .you have to wait , for example , to those who are always late and you lose time you have already paid on those waitings , besides your conversations never grow in deepness .i think travelling alone is much better .first of all , specially if you are on your holidays , you do not have to share or discuss your desitions with anybody .it happens to me last year , when i was on a group journey , that we were always arguing about what places to visit or even what to eat .on holidays , your are so tired of the whole year that arguing with someone exhaustes more than relaxes .thus , i like visiting places that most of the tourist not , for example museums , old buildings and cultural centres .why should i spend my time visiting places i am not interested in or discussing my preferences with persons i know will not share them ?
