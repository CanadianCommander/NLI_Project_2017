have you ever seen on television and advertisement that says that you are going to loose ten pounds in a week ?i heve seen this kind of adds many times no just on t.v. but in the news , radio , etc .at the begining i did trust them and i used to buy every single product that eventually will make me loose my extra-weight and make me look better .but then i just realized that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .five months ago i saw on t.v. an add about the pill of the century .acoording to them `` the pill will absorve the excess of oil in your body in just two weeks and you will have the shape you have ever drum with  .i bought the pill and after two weeks i end up with five more pounds .some copanies make their products seem much better than they really are just to sell and enhace their proffits , but how abot the consumers ?do they really care about the frustration of a girl like me for getting weight with their product instead of loosing it as they said ?the unswer is easy , they have the money they do not care about the rest .for instance , that time i rise a claim to the company against the product .i asked them for my money back .their unswer was : you should have exercised and not been a cauchpotatoe , the product that we sell is not a magic pill .in conclusion , companies should advetise their products as they really are .making them seem much better is the same that lying to the consumers , and if it is not a maggic product they should advertise it too , so that next time i wo nt be a couch potatoe and i will enroll in a gym .
