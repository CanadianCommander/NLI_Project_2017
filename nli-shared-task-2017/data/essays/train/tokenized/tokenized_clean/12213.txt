in my opinion it is more important to understand ideas about a lesson .i believe that students has to focus on main concept of issues .by learning facts , students can gain only the information .as for me , first reason for it that when students focus on the main idea of any lesson , they might improve the idea , and they can add different types of ideas to it .because i think that younger brains usually open for creativity .so if a teacher depends on teaching facts , he/she may cause lost of creativity in class .my second reason is , if students think about concepts and try to understand the idea , they can produce questions to teacher .so when they are asking these questions , they may understand and learn all the facts of lesson .in the class , if teachers pay attention on giving the main idea , they can help to raise in numbers of innovative individuals .because i believe that any student who ask questions by using `` how  and `` why  can learn all structure .when i was in high school we had two chemistry teachers in one year .our first chemistry teacher always asking elements properties whose students has to know from periodic table .so we should know all elements from that table .otherwise we sure that we ca nt pass the lesson .after his retirement , we had a new teacher for chemistry .she was always giving research homeworks in the class .also we had to prepare projects with our classmates .after that we got start to understand that how chemistry and it s theories works .we were staying in library for hours .we were reading articles about our homeworks .in the end of the year we gained a scientific point of view .and now , it s really hard to remember of any elements from periodic table .
