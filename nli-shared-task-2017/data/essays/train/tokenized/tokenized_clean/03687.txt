i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .even though i think it ^ s true that young people has more power to do new things , so that can make them excited .about me , just few days ago i went to my x junior high school to get in the pool with my friend .it ^ s forbidden .in the midnight .we get over the fence and suceeded to get in the pool .we laughed and laughed and laughed .it was fun because the task was risky , wasnt allowed , etc . .too many reasons .ill never forget this .so , young people can do anything , and easy to find something fun .i wouldnt find the stupid thing that we did fun when i got old .but i guess there ^ s another way to enjoy old people ^ s life .may be to do flower arrengement ?im not sure but , i think any person at any situation can enjoy their life if they want to enjoy their life .my friend , who is 18 years old recently had to stay at hospital for almost 2 weeks , firstly she complained about that often like * why me ??it is middle of summer break !i had many plans that i cant do now !i was sorry for her .a week later , when i went to her hospital room , she was doing a game that i gave her .she had never played a game before , but she started , and found it so much fun , and she is still now a big fun of games , my grandfather , who is dead when he was 87 , i love him so much by the way , enjoyed his life soooo much !he always said in his life time , that ` i am the happiest person in this world  he went to war comming back with nothing , he lost all his family and house then , but he worked hard and he built 3 buildings and became quite rich .he was in hell once but he used to say that ` working hard was fun because the more i work , the more money i get !money counting was the omly fun i have at that time .and he got me and my little sister as stepdaughters .he loved us more than anything .when he lost his ability to move his body , we went to his hospital everyday .he still said : im the happiest person in this world `` then .as i am the person who feels ok to everything that comes to me , if you are not healthy , if you are not pretty , if you do not have boy friend , if you are not young , if you are not old , you can make your time or even your life full of happiness .
