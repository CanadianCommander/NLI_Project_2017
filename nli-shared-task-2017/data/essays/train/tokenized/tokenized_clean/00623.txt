cars are indispensible thing to live in this modern life .when i was young our family did nt have a car and it was nt strange thing at all .in contrast , now our family owns two cars and also it is more difficult to find someone who does nt have a car in these days .we need cars in order to live in this morden life for many reasons .however , i do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than now .cars are important to live , right ?however , let us think what is more important thing to live .can you guess what i am talking ?yes , i am talking about the enviormental issue .again , cars are essential to live , but the earth , air , nature are much more important in order to maintain your life .the conservation nature activities are really popular these days .we have been killing our very home by overusing cars .then , people started to realize how they have been doing something wrong .i am korean , from seoul , one of the biggest cities in the world .in seoul , there are thousands and thousands of cars .if you see the sky in distance , we can see how dark it is .we know it is comfortable to use own car .however , we also come to realize that it is the time to protect our nature .so , we have started a compain not to use a car even a day a week .i guess , some people might contend that the life is getting busier and busier , there are some work to be done asap .no time to wait the bus to come .we need a car !however , there is another reason why i believe that less cars might be used in the future .here , the advent of the internet .now you do nt really go in person to talk and to do soem meeting , you can use the internet and do video conferance .futher , i am sure there will be better way to work with a person in distant later .like alternative transportation which does nt cause the air pollution .in sum , if all the relevant factor are taken into account , we should nt overuse a car .i do hope many people think our nature first than their own comfort .that s why i think there will be fewer cars than now in twenty years .
