people can be successfull in a lot of different ares .they can be successfull in sports , or music or in their proffession .but do they have in common , that they are trying new things and are taking risks ?in my opinion , that is definitely the case .people who are successsfull know what it means to be good at something .to get this feeling in manz different ares they try new things , because it could be possible that they succeed in this area as well .for example a good basketballer .he loves beeing the one people cheer at .to get this feeling more often he begins doing highjump or so .so that he could be successfull more often .i think that another very important point is the fear that they could suddenly fail , and this fear is as higher as successfull you are at the moment .failing in an area in which everbody considers you to be good is much harder than failing in something you are doing the first time .if i am doing a iq test and i was successfull , i fear to do it again .because i am worried about if i am as good as the last time .but doing an other test would not mind because no one could compare my results .so i prever to take some risk and do something new .the most important argument is that successfull people are willing to search for new aims and new competitions in their live more than `` looser charackters  .they are not worried about failing because they know they are good in something .no , they search for new competitions and new hurdles they could take successfullly .my friend for example is very good at athletics .but he does not want to stay here at home and do his sport like it is right now .no , he wants to go in a foreign country to compete there and to meassure with other students .this means a completly new surrounding for him and the risk he could fail , or could be not as successfull in athletics as he is here in germany .all in all i agree with this statement , because i only know successfull people , who are not only doing things they know they are good at , but who are trying new things and taking risks .
