yes , i strongly agree with this statement .many companies use this technique in-order to increase their selling quantities and so higher profits .advertisements in their nature purposes to be so , as they should appeal to the people in the most attractive manner , specially when the advertisment deals with products associated with teenagers .advertisments can be false either when it atempts to use inaccurate and exaggerated information or when it states facts about a product that are in-fact not true .almost any country has laws and punishments concerning about such issues .i can easily give supports and examples from our daily exposure to such advertisements , for example : the orbit channel advertisements ; the one related to the chemical hair remover `` epil stop  .the advertisement says that the solution removes the hair from its roots and in few minutes .we bought the product for my mom , and she tried it , but it appeared that the solution is unable to remove the hair from its roots , however , it just wipes the hair at the surface level .another example is the advertisement for milk , protein products , or energy drink .as the person in the advertisement shows a specially supernatural powers immediatly after drinking it , like winning in a running race , flying , or being able to get good grades .another example is advertisments for certain cars , like the one for chevorlete , when the driver of the car stops immediatly to avoid killing an animal , while in a very short ( phyisically impossible ) stopping distance .advertisements are always exaggerated in way or another ; thats the nature and the philosophy of the advertisement .but exaggerations should be limited .sometimes such exaggerations might be constructive , as in the case of the milk advertisment , as it encourage kids to drink more milk .however , it might be in some cases disadvantageous , as it would be a waste of money , as in the case of the hair remover .
