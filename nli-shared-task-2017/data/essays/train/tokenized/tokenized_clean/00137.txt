the question asks about tecqnology .in my opinion academic subjectsis better to have borad knowledhge than specialize in one specific subject .there are severl reasons shows at the bottom , why i disagree .first , the world is developing really fast .a centry ago people thinks specific subject is more important than acadamic subjects .also number of people still thinks specific subjuct is more important than academic subject .i would say that is wrong .if you have job like writer , musical job , artist or singer that migt better to have broad knowledge of may specific subject .but the world is developing really fast people need to follow the tecqnology .there are how to learn many academic subject .school in one of good case .most of high school in korean which i was from , learn more mathemathic , physics , chemistry , biology or computer .i believe the school is better to learn knowledge than others .second , i will give a different example about korea korea has good it tecqnology .so most of people working in computer part or science part .there are severl example about academic knowledge .the company needs employees also the employee have to have enough knoledge .in case i have a computer company .i need a 5 people need to work in my factory which makes cpu .most of people knows what is cpu some are not .people call cup is the brain in computer which means it is the most important part in computer .so i need to make the most important part , need to find people learned about  how to make cpu  .before learn that subject they need a lot of information about compter , that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing .go to far , unibersity or colloage .good unibersity or colloage need high grade .most of course in high schools are academic subjects .world is developing people need to follow that other ways we can not developing more and more .what i am saying now is the learning .in the learning i am saying ` academic subjects
