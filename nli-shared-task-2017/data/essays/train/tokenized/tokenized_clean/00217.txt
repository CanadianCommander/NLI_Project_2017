community ?who still helps his/her community ?surelly young people do it less and less .it surely is disappointing but there are obviously many reasons that explain this behaviour .firstly , it is hard for young people to find time to help their community .since school asks a lot of work and that more and more young people have sport after college , it is difficult for them to find a place in their schedule to help their community .in fact , society is so much turned towards self-accomplishment that it is hard for people brought up with this ideal to turn towards someting else .secondly , the point of view of the friends matters a lot , and since it does nt sound very `` sexy  to do community work , a lot of people just never do it .imagine the laughters of friends when you say are helping an old lady while they are going to play basketball !the young people helping their community may feel rejected and thus stop helping their community .i m not saying that paying attention to other people remarks is what i m doing or what i prone , not at all !i m just saying that it is a behaviour i have observed .thirdly , unless youg people work in a political field where they really have the power to make things move well people do nt really find it interesting to help their community .nowdays young people are so much turned towards the futur that ( often ) their only idea is to leave their city , to build their own life far away of the one their communities have .to conclude , young people do nt really help their community and it is a behaviour that is surelly pittyful .but can we really accuse these young people ?maybe it is also the fault of the society which build us up in a way that we don  t really feel the need of helping our community .a society yet more independant , more liberal and thus less familiar and social .
