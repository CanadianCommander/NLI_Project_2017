at the begining of 19th centry , the fisrt advertisement appeared in the public life .in fact , certain goods are meant to described as much better than they really are .however , in my personal opinion , i believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the ad makers are over promoting their goods .first of all , human beings are the animal that full of desires .we want ourselves to be respected and popular among others , so we usually willing to pay to help us make that target .for example , most of us using shampoo to wash our hair everyday , and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner .yet , is that true ?is there any science datas ever prove that shampoo can clean up our hair ?look at the tv shows , magazines and internet again , there are still full of sixy women who make themselves more charming by using certain brands of shampoos .as soon as we believe tthose advertisements , and presuated by them , we will go stright to spend money on buying their goods .and at most of time without even a reason .also , if you pass by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge ad of a sport star wearing a pair of nike sport shoes and looks so happy and cool , wo nt you strat to have a idea of `` wow , that shoes look so good  ?even so , is the truth truning out as a pair of nike shoes is the reason that we become cooler and happier ?easy enought , the answer is no .actully , it is not the game of advertisements make most of prodeucts seem better , but persaute you by connecting different signals and messages into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them .such as the shampoo and the pretty , sixty girls with their good looking hair , and the sport shoes plus the cool looking sports starts .therefore next time , if you see another great-looking product advertisement that make you own the desire of buying , think twice about are those goods really that good , or just yourself is simply thinking that way .
