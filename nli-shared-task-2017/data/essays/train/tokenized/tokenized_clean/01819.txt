i agree whit the statement that successful peolple try to do new things and not only what they are already good to do .in my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person , indeed successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already have nt the preparation to do that .someone ca nt became a real successful person if he doest try to risk .he has to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he doest know how to do that .in modern society it is more difficult to rase over other people than some years ago , so people , who want success , have to go over their own limits to try if they are really able to do some thing .it is like when someone bet , he does nt know if he will win , but he knows that if he will win he will be happy and successful .nowadays there is nt so much space for weak people in the high levels of the society .but there is a big problem about this aspect of successful people , and it is a proplem for all the society .i think doing this , there is a low quality of activity .in other words , if someone stop to do something when he becomes able to do that , because he wants to do something else , there wo nt be a person able to do that work and so there will be less quality .
