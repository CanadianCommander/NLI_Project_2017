i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two reasons for my opinion : the pupose of the advertisements is to sell the products , and the audiences do not see directly the products on their eyes .first , the purpose of the advertisements makes the goods seem much better .the advertisement company should present the goods to sell , not to show the virtue and vice of the goods .when people see the advertisement , the goods seem perfect and make people the happiest person in the world .when i was a middle school students , i really wanted to buy a new computer ; i actually did not have good knowledge of the computer .when i watched a fabulous advertisement of a computer , i pursuaded my parents to buy the computer on the advertisement .finally , my parents accepted my seggestion and bought me that computer .however , i found out my new computer used not genuin programs on the computer .i pursuaded my parents with the computer because the computer had everything looks best even though it was very cheap .i was very disappointed about the advertisements which described their products as the best at that time .second , the audiences does not see directly see the products on their eyes .people say that the goods on the picture or the tv look different when they see it directly .my sister had a similar situation recently .she bought a bag on the website which looked fine .however , she did not even recognize the bag because the color of the bag was different from the picture on the website .it was not the seller s fault but the camera s fault .i read an article related to these happening ; seeing an object on the picture and seeing the object on the naked eye are different because the camera lens produce the photo with mixing red , yellow and blue which cause distortion of colors .moreover , the advertisement companies devise the best angle of imposing lights on the product that the product looks better .this problem means that people should not precisly judge a product only according to the image presented on the picture or the tv .depends on my experiences and scientific knowledges , it is clear that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i hope that the advertisement companies try to show the virtue and the vice of their products rather than only show and exaggerate the quality of the products .moreover , i wish that scientists invent more accurate way of taking picture or recording that the audiences can face the goods more accurately .
