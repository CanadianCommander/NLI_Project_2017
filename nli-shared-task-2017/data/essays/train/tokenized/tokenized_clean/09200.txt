i do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .the reasons i support my view are following .firstly , the successful people got success because they like to take challenge .to try new things is a challenge to everybody , because people who did not know those things before would not know how to do or what to do about it , but successful people can get pratice in the process of trying the new things .they can pratice there ability from geting the new things .secondly , successful people will never stop their step , they are always going forward , that means they will not just do what they already know how to do well .to try new things is the step that going forward .they can beyond their selves by this way , they can improve theie sevles to solve the problems following in the future .a successful people shall have this quality , or he can not be a successful people .thirdly , the generation is changing always , new things are occuring always , someone must go to try and get the new things , or the generation can not change , human can not improve ourslves .why we call those people successful people ?because they do something common people can not do and contribute to human society .so these people are always walking in the front of the generation , they start the new generation .in conclusion , i do think successful people try new things and take risks risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because this , our world is becoming better and better , .
