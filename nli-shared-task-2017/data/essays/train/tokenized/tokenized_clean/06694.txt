i agree with the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , for several reasons .first , i think that the students should understand ideas and concepts because then they really know how a thing works .when they just learn a fact they will forget it soon after .on the other side it is obvious that they when they understood something once they will not forget it for a much longer time .however , sometimes it can be important to learn facts .the students should learn some important facts , because it is nessecary .for example , i think everzbody should know when the second world war startet and when it ended .this is just knowlege that everzbody needs that live nowadays .second , i think in the modern world it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts because today it is to difficult to know all the facts .we live in a world where everything is specialized .nobody is able to know all the facts , so it is much better to understand the basics .facts are getting more important for the persons who work and don t go to school anymore .a doctor for example has to know how the human body works .he has to know all kind of bones of a human being .for students it is not important that they can show all the specific bones of a human body .it is possible that a student that learns all the bones , will become a lawer in the future .then he has to know completely different thingsin conclusion , i agree in general with the statement .i just think that it is important for the students to know some basic facts .
