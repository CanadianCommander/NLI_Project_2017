while some people believe most advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are , l agree this statement.l think there are three important reason to support this idea .these are that to reach people is more esier and advertiser can show product diffirent with imitations and people do not have real information about products .as far as l know almost everybody has one television or radio .they can get all news from television or radio .for instance l watch t.v almost every day at least two hours .if people watch the same thing constantly after long time they believe imitated material on screen .as a matter of fact television especially most effective tool. l beleive also that all people are not educated to evaluate all prosess on television .they can accept all thing without thinking .another important reason is that l beleive advertiser get educational support to effect people .they take advantage of opportunity .they already have information how to influence people .for example people have some weaknesses such as emotion or dramatic .when we watch children who is carrying and listen to song so emotional backround we would like to do everythings .we feell that is our responsibility .last reason is that as a society do not like read books about .proof is amount of buying news papers , so advertiser can exaggate news for selling their product .we face to lack of the knowledge .if we have some informations we can seperate which one is correct which one is wrong .because of these reasons l support that vision can be changed by advertiser .however as a consumer we have to be more qualified .they depend on our life style .we have to spend time get rigth informations .
