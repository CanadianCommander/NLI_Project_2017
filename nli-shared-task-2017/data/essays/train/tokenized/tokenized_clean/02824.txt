the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one subject is an controversial one and i would describe the reasons why .the statement actually begs the question and is an overstatement at best .one must have a stronghold over one subject , and not just ` broad knowledge  and additionally , one should be aware of the happenings in other streams .the speaker s claim that one must have information of many subjects is problemetic at best .the speaker fails to give a number for ` many  here .however , i believe that any sincere student must have information over related subjects .for example , a student of food technology must be an informd student of biology , chemistry , biochemistry and engineering too .but his core stream will be food technology and its related subjects .thus , the speaker s claim of speacialising in one subject is unjustifiable since the student may know about related subjects in more detail than just having broad information .the student specialising in a subject is expected to know in detail about the subject .for example , a student studying medicine is expected to be proficient in not just ready with the information but also to be able to practice it as and when needed .this comes through continuous hard work and devotion to one s chosen field of study .if the student tries to indulge in other academic disciplines too much , he will harm the pateints and his own career .thus one has to be cautious about studying other subjects .studying many subjects , will make the student a mere dabbler who risks hampering furture growth .additionally the student is expected to have some inclination for arts and its various forms , political science , finance for these subjects help the student to go ahead with life with ease and to understand the significance of events efecting him .thus , the speaker s claim about knowing only one subject is also not sufficient .thus , both the scenarios - of having some knowledge about all the subjects and knowing everything about just one subject - should be discouraged .with the world becoming a smaller place and universities offering a host of admixed streams and choices to students , these are actually not even possible in today s scenario .a student should study hard at his chosen field of study and also , as he can devote time , try to learn other related and unrelated subjects but not at the cost of his subject .
