it seems on the first blush that older people donot have got much work to do , so they might enjoy their lives .however when one mulis over the issue with a brainstorming , it is the younger ones who take leisure the most .hence i more or less agree with the statement that ` the young people enjoy life more than the older people do  , by putting following examples .this is the twenty-first century .what allures almost each and everyone of us about this is the ` rapid advancement in globalization  .the world , day-by-day , is becoming a shorter place to live in .it does possess all the amenities which are needed for a luxurious life .now , who doesnt want to visit incredible continents like - africa , antarctica , america , asia etc . ?well , i surmise almost everyone of us .but mostly it is the younger generation who enjoy .the younger generations do have a spunk and an energy within themselves which have made it possible for the world to shrink in the sphere of tchnological advancements .with the aid of technology , the youngers exploit good reasons for having fun and enthusiasm .the wild parties on the exotic beaches of hawaii , itinerary for majestic and adventuruos wild sanctuaries of africa and asia , and many more are done and planned by the current generation .older people , on the other hand , live their lives in a solitary by enjoying in their ways , as they become physically shattered due to the old age .however , the younger generation , often called the ` m tv generation  - believes in a sole entertainment along with the advancements .for example , we often see younger people enjoy the safaries in serrengitti ( africa ) , as they have a privilege of exploring more and more as they are young .moreover , the amazing stunts of sky-divers and hearthrobbing experiences of the underwater-divers are most prevalent amongst the novices and the young ones .it is , once in a blue moon , that an older guy attains some accolade and is praised .to the contrary , the young persons of the society receive kudos often frequently .this clearly explains that the young people enjoy in a much better way .however , i believe that the young ones should not be sybarites , that is , there should never be a feeling of hedonism amongst them .as they have a privilege of enjoyng the grand and august life of this contemporary era , they should exploit it in a healthy manner , rather than milking out the pleasures of the other older people , who ones were young and naive .it should be the blend of the older people s experience and the vigor within the youngs which can lead to the prosperity of the world .
