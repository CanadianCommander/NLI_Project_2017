nowadays cars are useful , because they help people to move from one place to another .there are also other means of transport , such as train , bus , plane , bycicle , etc .i thinks that there are pros and contros for such a decision , as to use car instead of others means .cars are used mostly when you travel within your contry .for longer distance , train or plane are preferred .bycicle , instead , is used for shorter shifts .it helps somebody to keep fit and it s good for their health .moreover , cars are dangerous for the environment , destroying the atmosphere .some people , in fact , prefer using busses , in order to avoid smog and noise .even if bus is more uncomfortable than car , it is wider and wider used .plenty of people prefer car because they can stay there on by themselves , in order to get not in touch with sombody else .some others , prefer public means because they are willing to speak with other people .advertising meke you buy carsar as cars are concerned , i think that the only opportunity to diminuish them is to invent a new moder technology , in order to replace cars .it s up to the government to invent something to save the environment and , above all , the life of his citizenship .in fact more and more people have a disease , owing to the pollution and it s difficult to heal .therefore , i guess that if the people know the problem , they will do something to avoid it .the society we belong to change his habit in order to improve the world they live in .to sum it up , i sustain that in twenty years there will be fewer cars .
