there is a famous english proverb that illustrates the scope of this topic , it reads : `` he is a jack of all trades , ...but a master of none .what this proverb essentially implies is that it is not possible to attain mastery in several fields , one can only specialize in one .the statement of the issue being discussed epitomizes a very paradoxical situation that we as human beings encounter throughout the course of our life i.e the path of mastery or the path of overall education .it is often as a child you are asked the question : `` what do you want to be when you grow up ?.the child being ambitious and idealistic at the phase of his life would base his reply on his passion for a particular subject .well , it is true that most well educated human beings eventually settle down to choose a particular career based on their academic strength and prowess .when pusuing a higher education we are made to choose a subject that we wish to major in and probably the subject that will encompass our career in the future .we are forced to academically pusue a mastery in a particular field of life as this field shall play a vital role in determining our future , our social strength and our monetary power .it will help in determining what we will be in the future of the socio-economic struggle among us , which evidently has become an essential part of our survival .it is a fact , we need to attain mastery to build our success , we need to excel at something to prove our ability thus developing specialization in a particular axcademic subject is essential .there is however , a counter-claim to this argument , a claim which defines the power of a well rounded , overall education .possessing a fundamental and broad knowledge in every walk of life and having an opinion on all matters .a person who follows this ideal is a person whom i would define as a `` jack of all trades  .through my arguments i do not undermine the power of a well rounded academic back ground , what im trying to imply is that education is what is inculcated at the grass root levels .acquiring a broad knowledge of various academic fields is covered at the elementary and sub-secondary levels of education .it is after this stage , that a human being has metamorphosized from this phase of his life into a phase which is ready for mastery , he is in a position to choose .the options are always open in life , but it is our duty to choose and master the option that we most strongly believe in .this is a trait that will help us stand out as the masters of our field and give us purpose in life .we were born to make a difference in this world and by attaining mastery in one field of academia we can fulfill our duty to ourselves and humanity .
