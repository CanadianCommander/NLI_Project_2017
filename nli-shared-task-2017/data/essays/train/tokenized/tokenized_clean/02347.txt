it is definitely beneficial to have broad knowlegde of many acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .there are many reasons and examplpes to support this , from history of past centuries to the day today .having broad knowledge about many subjects leads to a broader scope of developement both for the individual and for the society .it helps to solve certain problems which involve complexities and interrelation of two or more subjects .from the past history we can relate many persons who have been successful in their work because of having a broader knowlege about other subjects .for example , leonardo da vinci was an artist , a philosopher , a scientist , an inventor and a sculptor .many of the historians believe that his paintings and his sculptures had a great resemblense with the true humans .and they state that this special resemblense came because of his interest in anatomy of the human body .it may be noted that science and arts are two different subjects .also there was a misconception in the earlier days of development of science that few subjects or propeties were independent , like mathematics and physics ; electricity and magnetism .but they were proved to be wrong .mathematics was invented for counting and developed for its applications in science .surely one would not desire to use integration , differenciation and geometry for counting .even today , the technology is being changed rapidly and many subjects are becoming interrelated .for example , computing and electronics .thus it is often good to have much knowledge about many academic subjects , rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
