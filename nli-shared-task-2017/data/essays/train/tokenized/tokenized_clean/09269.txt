`` the ideas and concepts are based on the individual one .no one can force to the other to follow her/his ideas .- it is well known adage .according to the statement it is important to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .i would also agree with this statement .from my point of view it is very impotant to be a successfull person to understand clearfully about the concepts and ideas wheteher in whichever field she/he is .we can take the example of the mathematics to support my thought .in mathematics we see that , its just depend on the concepts .if you have the concepts you can easily understood what the mathematics is all about .there are a lot of theorems in it which are just derive from the concepts .when the concepts of it are not clear to the student then he/she says oh my god how difficult it is .without knowing that how wonderful subject it is .the second example for supporting my ideas is computer languages .the computer language is beautiful combination of the ideas and the concepts .what you think is in the language bust conceptually structured .just take the example of visual basic language how nice and pliable language is this .if a student just follow the facts without noticing the concepts and ideas then it would be difficult to him to understand many problems of day - to-day life .since day-to-day life is based indirectly on the mathematics and which is total depend on the concepts .since facts ca nt be changed so they are not flexible as the concepts and ideas are .the student ca nt be a poetic one if he just depend on the facts since for the poetry the idea is very essential factor .so facts are necessary but with ideas and concepts .because with ideas and concepts the student can get profound knowledge about the subject .concepts are fit directly into the mind without any confusion .and this will help a student to achieve the goal and fulfill his dreams .
