were there be more cars in the future comparing to the number of cars used today ?in today s world , cars were used everywhere for the efficiency of transportation for people .they were the necessities of people in this century , and they served as an important tool used today .in my opinion , i disagreed that number of cars would decrease in twenty years .in contrast , i believe that the number of cars would increase in the near future .first , as what i ve mentioned previously , cars were an important usage for the people today .they made people easier to travel around their country , and they encouraged vacations outside their city .as people noticed the importance of cars everyday , they would as well encouraged them to buy a car for the sake of their own .as population increased , more teenagers would dream of having a car .as more and more people joined this world , more cars would be bought by consumers .with the growth of technology , consumers would have to buy more cars in order to maintain themselves in the world of modern technology .second , as more and more people in this world earned more money , they would have the desire to buy more cars rather than one .cars were made very attractive these years , and more people were attracted to the beauty and the eloquence of the newly designed cars .with the amount of fortune they have , they would be easily convinced to buy another car to fulfill their desire .owning two or three cars in the garage , people would be able to raise their social standards , and cope with the advancement of modern technologies .last but not least , families that consisted of more than six members would have the intention of buying more cars .one car in this kind of family was definitely not enough .as the family grew , they would want to change their cars into bigger ones that could fit the entire family .furthermore , the family would have to buy extra cars to meet different reasons .for example , one car could be used to drive children to school , while the other bigger car for family vacation .moreover , cars were the only way that families could travel together at a lower price .driving a car would only cost you fuel prices , but other transportations such as long distance buses and airplanes would cause you more .although many people would forfeit old cars and buy new ones to balance the number , the number of cars would simply increase as more families came to existence in this world .cars would grew their importance in this society , and people would begin to recognize their values .with the help of these cars , people could enjoy themselves more in an advanced society , and more time would be saved .
