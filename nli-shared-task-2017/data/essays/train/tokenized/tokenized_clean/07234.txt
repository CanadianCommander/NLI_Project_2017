during the twentieh century , cars have been in the very heart of the occidental society .since the early 1920 s , the number of individual vehicles had increased sharply .but today , many question themselves about the future of this kind of transportation .will there be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today ?i believe there will , for three main reasons : firstly because of a ressources run out , secondly because of environmental considerations , and eventually for pratical , technical reasons due to the amount of space left .i would start by pointing out a problem which is widespoken about in the media in these days , that is to say the lack of gas ressources .a recent study showed that if the chinese had as many cars as the average american , these chinese cars will consume all the gas production on earth .that underlines a serious problem : there is not enough gas on this planet to allow everybody to have one s own car .and this , i think , prevents cars from being this century s personal transportation .even though it has been tried to build cars running on hydrogen , the tests that were made have shown it would be much more expensive , much more dangerous , and much less efficient than gas .the lack of ressources is the first reason for which i believe there will be far fewer cars in twenty years .furthermore , cars running on gas have had a terrible effect on our planet s environment for the last century .people are slowly getting aware of that , even if it sometimes turns into real chestnuts , especially in french cities where 4x4 owners are told to be the main helpers of pollution , while there are plenty of other reasons .yet , it is a fact that cars pollute much , and that we are very unlikely to find a cleaner efficient ressource .finally , there is one very simple but crucial problem about cars , that is not as currently underlined as the lack of gas is : the lack of space .let s say that each single person in beijing , for instance , own one s personal car .what would happen ?we all have in mind the images of beijing s , or tokyo s incredibly crowded streets .how will how these people do to park their car , or even to get out milliom-car traffic jams with it ?shall we turn the whole world into a gigantic parking lot ?this problem is already happening in developped countries s largest cities , such as tokyo and new-york city .let s face it , it would be a disaster if everyone owns one s car in less developped countries s immense cities , let s say new delhi or johannesburg , where the infrastructures will certainly be poor , according to these cities s development .in twenty years , th earth will be crowded enough without any need for hundred-kilometer traffic jams .by way of conclusion , i would say that cars are definetely not our future , and that one should concentrate on improving public transportation .
