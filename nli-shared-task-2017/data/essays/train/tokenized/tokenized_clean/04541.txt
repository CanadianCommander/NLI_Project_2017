as video games and other modern activities become more and more common , some people think that there is a movement towards a behavior which includes to help their community less and therefore spending more time in front of computers .i do nt agree with the statement out of different reasons .schools and other institutions recently established some projects which are to involve students in social activities .for example , my school started a project called social internship .every student had to work in a social institution for two weeks where he or she had to support ill or homeless people .these projects strenghten the social skills of the students and i can tell out of my own experience that they initiate a special awareness to help other people in some situations .furthermore , there are many groups of volunteers who support the community .these groups help in various ways .first , there are some groups focussing on enviromental problems which collect garbage from woods and build some houses for birds .second , there are groups of students which take care of old people .they help them with the daily life , e.g. shopping , and spend their leisure time with reading books out to elderly people who are nt able to read them by themselves anymore .third , there are also some political motivated groups .apart from that , there were made several surveys which proved that most of the young people today are willing to help .it does nt have to be a big support , because i think it is better if many people do little improvements than if a few want to change the whole world .people who claim that young people do nt help the community in these days should perhaps have a closer look on how teenagers and young adults spend their leisure time instead of to believe preconceptions .
