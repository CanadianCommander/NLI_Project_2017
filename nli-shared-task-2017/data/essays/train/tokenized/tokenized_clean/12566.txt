i have to admit that concepts and ideas are often neglected next to all the facts that students have to learn .history lessons are a good example .if you know all the dates , names and places that does not mean that you have understood the complex interaction of causes , consequences and motivations .sometimes it is not even necessary to know exactly on which day or where something happend .important is that it happened .what led to it and its impact on the future may be of much greater interest than its exact date .is it not much more important what einstein discovered than knowing on what day he was born ?is it not more important to know that his invention led to the nuclear bomb than to know the place where he was born ?of course , without facts nothing works .you could not teach history without dates , names and places .you could not explain any concept or idea without the facts that it bases on .facts are the foundation to any thinking beyond .you can only understand why einstein gave his idea to the americans if you know the fact that he was a jew .that is why i think that there should be a balance between facts and more .students should get those facts that are necessary to understand the concept .in my eyes they are both equally important .one without the other is nothing .if you know all the elements of a computer you still can not put them together correctly .if you possess the instruction but do not have all the elements it does not work either .and even if you have both it is not easy .but if someone explains it to you you might succeed .this is what teachers should do .they should give students the facts , some material about how to understand them and explain the big connections .i do not think that ideas and concepts are more important than facts , each is important in its own way .ideas and concepts are based on facts .students should learn both to be prepared for life .
