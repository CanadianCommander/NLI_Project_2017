young people do not give enough time to helping their communites and that is one of the main social issues for nowadays .it was not issued in the past , however as the industry is keep growing and becoming more wealthier , it began to have one of the social problem for nowadays .we would like to find out some several reasons and examples for this issue .for young people , they are getting intended to spend more time with his or her freinds rather than spending time with the communities in which could make more pressure and could have unfamiliar for their habits .it is obvious that they have less pressure for meeting with their own friends and could enjoy their own lifestlye .they are thinking that they better go to concert and watch the famous stars in the stages .educational problem could cause making young people to be more selfish .most of the young people have had lots of pressures for studying subjects in order to get a good grade and go to the better university and finally having a better job in which would make more salary .they are thinking about their own interest and their lifestlye not the other people communities .it is pretty sad to hear the more young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .people have to live together and communicate together whatever or whereever they live in the earth .losing personal time could minimize to do their own interest habits , but helping their communities is pretty impotant in order to make better society with positive thinking .young people will need to have sacrificing their spirits and to be more aggressive in order to make a better society and that could make a better world in the future and their family .
