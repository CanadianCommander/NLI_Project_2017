nowadays , there are many new things appearing day by day , including some new techoniques , such as computer , internet and so on .sometimes we may think these new things are just preparied for young people , because it is very hard for older people to be adapt to such things .so , some people draw a conclusion that ` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .as far as i am conserned , i totally disaree with this statement .there are several reasons .firstly , some young people just are addicted to the ` new things  , such as computer games .they do nt know how to deal with such things .and they do nt know how to benefit from these things .on the other hand , the older people do know .once they get to know that something is useful for them , they can get involved in it and enjoy it .when i was a undergrad , some of my classmates were addicted by a computer game , namely counter strike , when they play this game , they could forget to have food , forget to sleep .it did halm to their health , then how can we say that they were enjoying their life when playing such games ?however , hardly can we hear older people do the same things .secondly , older people know more about life .maybe they do nt know many new things , but they can understand every new things .they can judge correctly whether those new things are useful for them .they are able to enjoy every new thing for them .while usually , the young people can not do this .lastly , nowadays , many young men tend to be more selfish , more temptuous , more ill-tempered .thus , it is more difficult for them to share things with others , to have good friends , to understand this society , this world .and these things are the most important things for our lives .older people do it better .so , actually , older people enjoy life more than young peole .in summary , in modern days , although young men may know more news things than older people , they do nt enjoy life more than older people .
