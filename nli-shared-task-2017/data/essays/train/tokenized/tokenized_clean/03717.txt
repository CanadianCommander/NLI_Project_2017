it is sometimes difficult to discuss people s views on the way of travelling because it is such a multifaceted topic .some tend to think that there are many merits to travel by their own plans while others say it is better to be led by a tour guide .i have developed my own opinions on the topic .i favor the latter position over the former for several reasons , and i would like to explore two of the conspicuous ones in the following passages .first of all , if we are led by a guide , we do not have to spend a great amount of time considering where to go and how long to stay .the guide has already arranged the schedule for us .as a result , all we have to do is follow the schdule and have a good time .for instance , when i was a junior high student , my parents and i went to singapore led by a tour guide .the tour guide was so familiar with the country that she introduced us everything about singapore .needless to say , we visited the most important spots in the country .all of us really appreciated the tour guide for such a wonderful trip .second thing that must be taken into consideration is that we are likely to make new friends in the group .it goes without saying that it is very boring when we visit some interesting places without friends .in the group , we can make good friends with one another and share all the happiness on the trip .for examples , on the travel to singapore , my new friends and i played together day and night .they did bring me a lot of fun during the trip .though the trip is over for a long time , we have still kept in touch closely .of course , i do not suggest that my perspectives are unassailable .there are still some advantages for us to take a travel on our own plans .nevertheless , i think the opinions i have provided above are more important and stronger .
