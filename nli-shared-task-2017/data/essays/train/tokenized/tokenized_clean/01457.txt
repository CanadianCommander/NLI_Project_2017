knowledge is an ocean whoose depth increases as you go deeper .so , it is next to impossible for a human being to have a complete expertise over any subject all what a person can do is have a good approach towards a topic so as to have the best available information about it .in my opinion it is always good have an idea of vairious academic streames and then cofine your study to a particular one when you have acquired a elementary knowledge of many .it is very important to have fundamentals of variegated disciplines , even if it does nt relate to you .take an example of curriculum followed by the junior high and high schools where a student gets to learn almost all most all possible fields of study right from science to econonics to languages and history .this helps to decide what field you may take up in your future .having a knowledge of different types of feilds exposes you to experiments .you can use your knowledge for relating two different aspects of study .moreover it creats channels for the exchange of idea .else how do you expect an electronics engineer to have a discussion with an automobile engg or a computer technical .we have real life examples like leonaordo da vinci , albert einstein .who have knowledge of multiple feilds like science , arts , philosophy and have still proved to be geniuses in what they did .focussing on one single aspect through out your lifetime will lead to a wan and gloomy lifestyle with less interest to learn at a point of time in our life .whereas interactions with vairious particulars will help you discover and energetic to learn .having a broad knowledege of many academic subjects does nt not signify specialsing in all of them but it definetly boosts you to come out of the nutshell of a particular filed .learning is a process which has no ends so one must keep working towards the expansion of his ` ken  .expertising any particular area does nt guarantee success neither does it hinder your path towards it , but exploirng different ideas keeps alive the desire to learn .
