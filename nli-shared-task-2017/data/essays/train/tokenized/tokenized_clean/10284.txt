i do nt agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than loder people do ..as a senior citizen , old people have already finished their duties to their families and the socioal , so they do nt have many things to involotion them .they can spend much time to travelling and to see their old friends who are also senior citizens , sometimes they can even walk for a whole day to enjoy the sunline and flesh air .at home old people are always no.1 .some people say that old people have not much time to enjoy themselves , but i do nt think so , as they have no work to do , they seem to have more time to enjoy lives , on the other hand , how many young people really have time to realx themselves , as in the school they have countless homework to do , and countless words to hear from teachers and parents .to the young workers , you can never realx yourself as you must work hard as you have to affect your family and your parents .many people say that old people ca nt catch up with the society , something like music and games which is so atracted to us .but what will i say is that as them are nt interested in these things they miss nothing .they have many things to every day as these things are what they think are interesting .and as a old people who have enough experiences they always do many things in a more quickly and easier than the young people .and old people always have enough things to think as we need to spend a lives to get .
