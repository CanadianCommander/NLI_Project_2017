some people argue that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .to be frank , i agree with the idea .i have numerous reason to support my argument , here i just illustate some of them .first and formost , there will be less and less resoures in the earth in twenty years , such as gas , oil .and the price of these resources will grow up qiuckly , which made the private cars less and less popular .so the rail-way and subway transportation will play an improtant role in the future .so the number of private cars will be reduced greatly by the market rules .what s more , the bus and subway will be cheaper and more efficient for the people in twenty years with the development of science and tecnology .at that time , choosing trave by car , particurly private car , will be not a wise decision , because it cost more , gain less .one strong argument for my conclusion is that there may be more convinent tasportation ways in the world in twenty years .for example , the bike with solar energy system may be invented in the future , which will replace the positions of cars as the main method of traveling and transportation .so , in a word , i believe that new tools which is better for tansportation will be invented in twenty years .last but not least , the cars have bad effect in the environment .they cosume the gas and output the harmful gas to the environment .so the use and the number of the cars may be controled by the goverment .and the people will also pay more attention to their health , so , more people will choose bike as the main transportation tool , not only for the cheap price , but also for rding the bike has good effect on people s health .so , in conclusion , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i reinforce my stand point by list the major reasons above .
