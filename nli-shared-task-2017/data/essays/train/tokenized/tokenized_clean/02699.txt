yes , i agree that young people enjoy more than older people .young age means the teenage where most of the people spoil their life rather moulding it into a good future .they study till the secondary school but as soon as they enter into their college life they enjoy rather concentrate on their studies .he is not aware of the future experiences and problems he would face .young people enjoy in their teenage keeping studies aside .most of the people in their young age are not aware of the future .they just waste time in enjoying and partying .so that they can not became a successful person in these society .he can not reach his goal .every person has their on goal but we have to fulfill .by enjoying we waste half of our life and suffer half of the life .their is no use of recognition after the teenage is passed .they think that they have grown up and can handle their decisions on their own .they think that they know what is right and what is wrong .they go on for parties without the permission of parents and return late nights .they smoke , they drink and commits lots of mistakes .they break the parents reputations .but the same person when he comes to old age he shall think of the past what he have done .he stops all the enjoyments and concentrate on the works and settlement .he thinks as a mature person .young people are not matured and can not take decisions on their own .they live in a world of fantasy , passionate and fashionable .he wanders on the streets and creates havoc to the public .most of the young people who thinks in a better way get settles in life but those are still on roads .so everything is in our hands , we should have to change our life according to ur wish .
