i personally agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .it s quite usual to see that several young people hanging out in a pub or a football field , but it s unusually to see they are appearing at community centres or a aged person s back yard to help him/her to clean .the world is becoming more attractive to young people than ever before .the internet , various computer games , gaming consoles , fancy toys and etc. have been taking a lot of time from the young generation .compared to the past , young people used to spend more time on studying , and also more time on participating community activities , and helping and learning from each other .the relationship between people , especially in urban areas , are getting far more looser than before , which partially causes young generation are more relying on themselves than on the neighbourhood .everyone is busying on their own stuff and trying to make more money to get so called better life while ignoring the importance of the communities that they belong to .family teaching may be another reason why young people prefer staying away from others .lots of facts showed that our society are not becoming safer .instead , we are seeing moer and more criminals reported everyday , our neighbourhood are no long a safe place to be .lots of parents are more likely to leave their children at home while they are busying on their own business .from very young , children learnt to play with themselves at home , and to spent their time at home .to conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activities which will help them to understand an important part of lives , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .
