i do not believe that succesful people always have to try new things rather than doing what they do best .a successful person is nt someone who is good in everything he or she tries , it is someone who is among the best in what he or she knows the best .if the former definition was true it would mean that there are nt any successful people in life because noone can be good at everything .many people consider bill gates as a successful person .after all , he took the risk , established microsoft , and earned billions of dollars from it .however , even he does nt try other things that are outside of his strenghts , such as swimming .i am one of the best swimmers turkey has ever seen , and i hold multiple national records .many people consider me as a successful person as well .suppose that bill gates was to try a swimming career , and we competed side to side in a meet .doubtlessly , i would have won , but would that make bill gates a loser , instead of a successful person ?would it mean that i am more successful than him ?i think not .success is about what you can achieve with what you are given , not about how many risks you take .a one year old talking baby is a successful baby .a student with the iq 150 getting 90 per cent on a logic test is not so successful .taking risks and trying new things in life broadens your vision , it does nt have anything to do with being successful .people who do what they do best are already successful .they do nt need to wander around for new excitements just so that other people consider him or her to be successful as well .
