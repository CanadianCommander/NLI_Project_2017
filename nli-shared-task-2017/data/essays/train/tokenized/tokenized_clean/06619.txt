i am a young person and i am working for free in the catholic community of my hometown .so i have a good idea of what young people do to help in their communities .because of this , i am convinced that the statement is wrong .i know many young peolpe which are helping in the catholic community .there are many holiday camps for children which are organized by young people in our community .there is also a monthly meeting of this people .new games or special festivals are organized by this group of young peolpe .many peolpe do not recognize this work .it is not so obviously like beeing a trainer of a children soccer team .but not all young people are working in a community like me .i believe this is because working in communities is first of all not very honorable .many people do not even care about the community work .communtiy work will be noticed the first time by them , if nobody does it anymore .second , community work is not very attractive to young people .the most people , working for free in the community , are very old .but it is not much fun for any teenager to work with seniors .if their friends spend time helping the community , most of the young people will have a great plessure to help their communities - togehter with their friends .and it is also a problem that most of community work is not for the youth .young peolpe do not see the neccessarity to help their community , because the community work does not take effect in their allday life .overall , i am convinced that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .furthermore , i believe that they do more at this time then in the past .
