some people think that the youth nowadays are not intersted in heiping their communitis .however , i stongly disagree with that opinion , for the following reasons .first , a lot of young people including collegeate students and secondary school students are forced to help others by their school .most of the publich schools have a regulation about the obligatory volunteer hours and they encouge students to experience to help people who are in need .in my case , to graduate both secondary school and university i had to do the obligatory volunteer .this is not a good case because there s no my will but it can be helpful to experience and can give some motivation to students .to meet the needs of the school curriculum , i had to do volunteer work for local community when i was a secondary school students .even though it was obligatory experience , i could take part in community program and i came to be interested in local problems and other people who are in need .moreover , these days a increaing number of young people would like to participate in volunteer works .they paricipate in their communities problems by joining some organization such as extra-curricular clubs in campus or non-governmental organization .through the organization , i have been able to be a mentor to a young criminal who has been under the probation by ministry of justice .when i wanted to join that program , i was surprise by seeing a lot of university students who applied for this organization to be a volunteer work .nowadays , a lot of organizations set up and they are managed by lots of volunteer workers .we need to keep watching their behavior .even though , they could start the volunteer work to meet the schools needs , it can be lasted because of their strong will .
