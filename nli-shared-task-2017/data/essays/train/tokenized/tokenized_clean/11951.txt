some people disagree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i guess the people are just lucky .most of the time the goods look much better than they really are .for instences , when you go try to taste a new menu of food , or when you buy fornitures .for the first exsample , when you watch the advertisement about the fast food on tv , it looks flesh , and looks homemade .however when you try the menu at the fast food restaurant , the vesitable is not flesh , and they do not taste the same as the tv sais .second , you see fornitures on the catalogu .they look very gorgious and beutiful .however when you go to the store to see the fornitures that were on the catalogu , they look so different .they look cheap , the color is different , and the shapes are a little different .i think the display on the catalogu makes them very fasinating .although most adveetisement make products seem much better than they raelly are .they complimant about the goods too much on tv , and also they take very good picture of them .
