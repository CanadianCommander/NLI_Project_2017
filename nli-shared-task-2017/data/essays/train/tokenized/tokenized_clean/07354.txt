i think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .of couse i think car company will produce a new model , and we want to buy more .however , it is difficult to increase cars more , because there are 2 big problem , poluteing enviroment and losting fossil energy .at first , we have to think about the poluting enviroment .now , the car s gas is poluting our enviroment .i think if we have more cars , our enviroment would be change .and it is not only poluting the envitroment , but also effect our health .reasently , there is a news that there are many people in tokyo are worried about cought is because of car s gas .so , poluting our enviroment is big problem and we have to reduce the car s gas .moreover , we have to think about the fossil energy .now , most of the cars are moved by the fossil .but , the fossil is not produced easily , it is limited .so , we have to reduce to use the fossil .accoding to these reasons , i think tere will be fewer cars .
