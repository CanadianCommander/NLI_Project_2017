i disagree with the statement , in my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject field .in todays world where the economy is growing at an uncontrolable speed , every industry is no less than a global giant , every field is becoming a money minting arena , in such an environment is will be a gross mistake to have a broad knowledge .specialization gives one an indepth of the subject .it gives one the chance to excel and give ones hundered percent to a specific field .it makes us clearly see our weaknesses and strenghts and helps us to evaluate ourselves and see where we really stand .broad knowledge is like a half baked story where one is not exceling in any specific field .one can pick any field , art , business , music or even politics , everything requires the best peopleand those kind of empoyees who know their subject backwards .in such a senario one can not take a chance by having a broad grip on all subjects .a situation such as this would only create doubt and ultimately a low pay or unemployment .there is another alternative to this dillema and that is that alongside being specialized in any one field one can also have a hobby .for example , a film star , she loves her news coverage , her fame , her glory , her fortune , but there are times when everyone wants to forget their work and find themselves by doing things that they enjoy .she can do social sevice or something small like pottery or photography at a hobby .` if a bird spreads its wings beyond its reach , it will crash  .thus , according to me it is more sensible to choose one line of work and excel in it .but yes sometimes we must retrieve and pursue other samll activities as well .
