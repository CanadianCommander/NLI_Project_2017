here the topic is about , is it more important to the students to understand ideas and conceots than it is for them to learn the facts .i strongly agree with the point of understanding the ideas and concepts .every student should have the concept and understand the ideas rather than learning the facts about that .by lerning the concept the student can understand the subject very well and can be easy with that subject .if we understand the ideas of the subject the student can proceed with the subject very well , and go deeper into the subject of which he is understanding .for example if we take the mathematics we need to have concept in the maths than the facts regarding that , the ideas are more important in mathematics than the facts .if we have the facts knowing about the mathematics then the real concept is not concentrated .because in mathematics practice is more important than knowing the facts .the student who is concerned about the facts it is of no use , because if he concentrated on facts he can not be in the competitive world , as the oter students are going fast by knowing the concepts and ideas .if you take a class room in which a student is intrested in knowing the facts rather than the concept and the ideas then he will certainly loosing something which other students are gaining , being a conceptual and knowing the ideas is the encoureged way then knowing the facts .at last i state that be a conceptual person and understand the ideas rather than to be knowing the facts .understanding the ideas will not featch a lot in the student life
