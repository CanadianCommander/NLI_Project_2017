i agree with the argument that within twenty years the number of cars in use will decrease compared to the current situation for a variety of reasons .to begin with , almost all of the people who are using cars and even public transport to go to work , and surprisingly even the ones who rarely goes out , complain about the overabundance of cars on the roads .a lot of cars mean a lot of traffic and noise , hence a lot of time spent while trying to get to one place from another .those factors put stress on people and so make use of cars an undesirable thing for them .secondly , people are aware of the fact that extensive use of cars cause air and noise pollution .that probably explains why some citizens had already left big cities for out-of-city areas where there is few pollution and noise .as people become more conscious about the environmental effects of extensive use of cars , i guess they will give up driving and shift to alternative ways .another reason , which is connected with the reasons i mentioned about so far , is the increasing investment of local governments and municipalities on public transportation .subway in that sense is a good solution as it brings the heavy load of traffic underground and allows for quicker and safer transport for people .as public transportation network becomes wider , people will give up driving for a shorter and safer time on roads .and the last reason i want to mention is the rapidly increasing price of oil .for the last couple of years there has been a sharp increase in oil prices because of global economic situations and the iraq war .furthermore , the oil resources are not as much as to meet people s demands for many more decades .as a result of those , the increase in oil prices becomes inevitable .because people s budgets do not increase at the same rate with oil prices , they will use their cars less , eventually causing a decrease in the number of cars .in the light of the reasons i mentioned above , i believe that people will shift to public transportation and finally the number of cars in use will be fewer than today .
