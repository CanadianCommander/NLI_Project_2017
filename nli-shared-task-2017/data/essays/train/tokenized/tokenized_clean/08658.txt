today , scientific technology is developing continuously .the field of scince is helping our lives a lot in many ways .one example is transportaion .people should spend a lot more time to move from one place to another place when they did nt have transportation but it became possible as they have many different ways of transportation .for example , subway , trains , airplane , bike , cars and so on .they brought us a lot of advantages .however , the transportations have also disadvantages .in my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are toay because cars cause pollution and are dangerous .first , cars bring pollution to us as producing a lot of exhaust gas .to move cars , we have to use gasoline gas or lpg gas now .however , those gases are extremly harmful to our societies .they affect us to end up the various disease and increasing of carbon dioxide in the air .as we breath , we are taking dirty particles from the air .also , increasing carbon dioxide is serious problem now in the world .it could lead to bigger problem such as global warming which also cause many different events including melting ice mountains so that the level of the ocean is getting higer .using more cars mean that we are going to bring more environmental problems to the world .second , cars are dangerous as i said before .there are so many accidents occuring everyday by cars .we can reduce those accidents by practicing not to use cars .instead of using cars , we could use other transportation which cause less accidents .also , the issue of traffic jam affected by car accidents in the middle of the highway could be the problem .as they solve the problem of accident , more people could have damage from it .cars could bring us dangerous accidents including death .in conclusion , development of scientific technology would help to create better transportation than cars so that people could use it without causing pollution and accidents .therefore , in twenty years there wilil be fewer cars in use than there are today .
