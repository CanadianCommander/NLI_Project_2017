students usually have many kinds of different caratheristics .someone can memorize a poetry in few minutes and play it without failing a single word , someone else can understand very easily difficoult concepts of math or phisic .i am one of the last cathegory and i think that understanding an ideas or a concept is more importatnt than learning facts .first of all , whenever i have learnt a fact without understanding the logic meaning of it , i have forgotten it after some weeks because memorizing details is useless .i think students can remember ideas and concepts longer then facts and , for this reason , they can maintain informations even after long time and this is the main porpouse of shool education .another important reason is that brain developes much more thinking about an ideas or a concept than memorizing something .in fact , trying to figure out a problem , collecting thougths and making choices for reaching the best solution is more stimoulant for a student who learns to use his or her brain .instead , learning just fact memorizing details , brain works in other ways , developing not the most important and usefull parts of it .thus , i support a teaching method based on understanding concepts and ideas , much more that a method based on memorazing informations and facts which i think they can not last long time .
