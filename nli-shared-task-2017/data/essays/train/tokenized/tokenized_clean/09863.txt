yes , i agree to the statement .there are many reasons and examples , i would like to cite in support of my opinion .generally , in everyone s life success comes through hard work .by taking new risks , trying new things one can achieve success in their lifes .only successful people try new things and take risks than doing well which is already existed .for example , in consideration of my life , firstly `` i will always try new things and take risks  .the reasons are by taking risks and try new things - we can know more things not only on the subject but also on the practical purposes .it is always beneficial to take risks which helps to work on our goals , it improves our talent , briskness , stability , strength , curiosity to know the things .secondly  when i am doing my project in my college labs - all lecturers , friends told that it is impossible to continue on that project .but i had taken it in a challenged way and lot of risk is taken on that project , i read lot of books for that project which helped me in gaining more knowledge on the subject and even some things are know for me which are not told by my professors .in this way , i finally succeeded in my project and all are praised me as a successful person .so it is always better to try things in new ways and take risks to become successful person rather than doing on the existing .therefore i suggest to try new , learn new things , and to do risks .however , in some cases successful persons are not taking risks and they are doing work on the existing thing to the advanced level .it is also an achievement to do the work on the existing thing .it all depends on how we approached and succeded towards to that aim .but some people success or not , it helps to enhance in their individual thinking and creativity .insum , i would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reasons and examples .
