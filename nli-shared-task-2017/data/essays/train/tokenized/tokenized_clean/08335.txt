ideas and concept are very important to understand about the particular topic because without understanding the main concept about the particular topic one can not learn the facts hence in my point of view it was very important for students to know about the main idea and concept of the particular topic .for example one student was planned to pursue biotechnology course in masters degree before knowing about the main idea means its applications and idea means what about the future job aspects in this course , what is the use of learning about the facts that in biotechnology means many new medicines for many diseases can discover ?aristotle was the ` father of biology  , let us think how he became .the anawer we got was by studying about the main concepts in biology and also gregor johan mendel who studied about the concept of pea plant and understanding the ideas only he discoverded laws of inheritance .not only the above mentioned scientists louis pasteur by understanding the concept that microorganisms are responsible for souring of wine , converting milk to curd , made him to discover many new findings in microbiology .so my final conclusion was by learning the concept and main ideas students can excel in their life like the above mentioned scientists not by only revealing and studying the facts
