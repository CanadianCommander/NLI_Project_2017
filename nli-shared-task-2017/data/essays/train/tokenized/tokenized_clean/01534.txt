i do not agree with this statement .this essay will explore my reasoning why i do not support the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than it is for them to learn facts .first , i believe that learning is a step by step process .understanding ideas and concepts , and learning facts are both form the crucial steps of this process .if one step is missing learning can not be completed .for example preparing a meal requires some necessary steps .if the cook has all the ingreditens and the cooking pan but nevertheless he does not have an oven there will be no meal .i believe that it is the same in learning as well .if someone understand all the key points and concepts but does not learn the facts the learning can not be completed .second , this statement does not explain clearly which kind of subjects are the main aspects of the discussion .as some meals do not require cooking such as a salad , in some subject areas learning the facts is not necessary as understanding the ideas and concepts .for instance especially in social sciences understanding the issues matter most than learning the facts since students are required to form their own facts through analyzing the ideas .however in scientific subjects such as chemistry or biology understanding the ideas will not be enough and learning the facts is crucial .for example a chemistry student can understand that the idea of exploding elements but he needs to know the results what happens if those elements come together .as being a fourth year business administration student i do not remember a time when just understanding ideas were enough for me to learn a subject as a whole without knowing the facts .i believe that ideas and facts go hand in hand in the process of learning .in conclusion this statement misses out the importance of the different learning requirements of different subject areas and discourages students from trying to learn the facts .no matter what is the level of importance of the facts on the subject area , as i mentioned before the learning process is a step by step process .thus , without the step of learning facts it will not be completed as it is supposed to .many people do not even eat salad without chicken or beef in it , so even salad sometimes require cooking .therefore i believe many students may need to know the facts of a subject whey they understand the ideas of it as well .
