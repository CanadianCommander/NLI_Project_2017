most of the people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better .they think that whether they know everyhing about a subject or not is nt important .in contrast to these , i believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .i always give importance to complete a job that i work on .it is nt enough for me to do only some part of it .i think , for getting a success it is very important to complete the job .eveybody wants to have broad knowledge but there is an important point , do you specialize on it or do you know only a part of it .in daily life , there is lots of people who are trying to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledge about it or not .i do nt agree with it .if i do nt have a knowledge about a subject , i wo nt talk on it , i will only listen people to get their ideas and learn something about this subjects .if i want to specialize in this subject , i begin to research about it .and for days i study on it for having the true knowledge .on the other hand , i always try to add knowledge to my knowledge day by day dy .because i know that for getting a success , a person should be adaptable to changes .i do nt forget a discussion about this situation with my best friend .we are talking about tennis .i have been playing tennis since 1991 .i know every detail about tennis .however , my friend never plays tennis .she asked me a question about a racket and i gce information about her question but she said she know better than me .and she began to give wrong information to my friens .and after this experince , i decide not to talk on a subject that i do nt know or only know a part of it .in conlusion , i always think that foir getting success it is not better to have broad knowlede than specialize
