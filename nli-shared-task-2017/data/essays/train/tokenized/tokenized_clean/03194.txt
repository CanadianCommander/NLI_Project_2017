in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?i am not able to support this point of view , ` though i wish i were ( for i do not only have no use for a car myself , but i also cars as being one of the major factors that cause the greenhouse effect and global warming ) .i will ( try to ) mention several possible arguments supporting the assumption that the number of cars will decrease , opposing each and evry one of them right away .after that , i will try to establish further arguments emphasizing my point of view .a traditional argument for the vanishing of cars has always been the worry about sufficient fuel supply .considering the need for oil on the planet and the fact this natural resource is a limited one , either the number of cars will have to decrease ( for there will soon be no more fuel to run them ) or there will be new inventions in the field of motor vehicles ( such as hybrid or solar cars ) .the latter has been a great wish of ecologically-conscious people .nevertheless , car lobbies ( trying to maintain their traditional market ) as well as oil lobbies ( trying to sell their last barrels of oil before they have to look for other occupations ) counteract such developments - with great success .there has not been a considerable evolution regarding motor vehicles which could end the dependency on oil : hybrid cars , for example , still use fossil fuel ( for otherewise they were ` pure  ) ; solar cars on the contrary do nt have the ` performance  which is demanded an wanted from a car .still , the former alternative may be relevant : the end of oil .opposing this argument , one has to mention that oil companies ( as stated above ) will attempt to sell all the oil available on the planet , which will take another 50 years approximately .therefore , until oil s gone , the cars remain and they ll remain at least another 50 years .another argument is that of the development of public transport , which is very easy to answer by referring to the countless remote places and regions on the planet , which will hardly ever be supplied with public transportation vehicles such as trains or busses .one rather sophisticated argument , the one i consider the most rational one , is the reference to the social ( infra ) structure of large cities , which makes cars often aviodable , e.g. by using subways or monorails .yet , there are more than 6 billion people on the planet .not all of them can inhabit such highly-developed cities and are therefor dependent on cars .to my very own mind , a very decisive argument is that cars do not only fulfil a purpose of trnsportation , but tey are also considered as status symbols .people want to ` show off  with their cars .this need hav made ecocologally-poor companies like gm so successful , and in my mind must be a major argument for cars maintaining a plague on our planet .
