learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts are the different ways of learning and they also need different kind of attentions .i am a university student and i prefer learning facts rather than understanding the ideas and concepts .i said they have different kind of attention and first i want to explain this .when you try to understand ideas and concepts you generally spend more time .you should cover whole issue to understand it .most professors try to use this method and while coming the important points of issue they are talking a lot .in my opinion , they are giving unnecesery knowledge .however , if professors just give the important parts of the subject than students may understand better and it wouldt take much time than talking about unnecessary things .the second important thing that we should talk about is that the human brain can also concentrate 25-30 minutes at all .that s why on the 35th minute of lecture the student start to daydream while the professor just coming the most important part of subject .if teachers want to teach better , they should stop talking and trying to cover the whole idea .i insist on just giving the important parts of issue and then start to cover the subject while solving problems or debating for example .this is more succesfull way to teach and more convenient for students , too .to sum up , i totally disagree the way of undertanding ideas and concepts .that is a less of time and time is more important that students .teachers should use time conveniently and just give the student the important parts not the whole of the subject .
