everyone in this life like to be a successful person , but it is not easy to be a successful .to be a successful persons you should have many charicristic that it could help you .and i agree that the person who wants to be successed he should be a risky perosn and should not be worried about some easy thing that could be solved .i agree with this for reasons .firstly , if the persons stood and wiaited for people to do every thing for him , he would not be a successful persons .there are alot of people who are like that , i will give an example of many people that i can see them in my daily life .the example is that one of my best friend who wants to be a successful medical doctor , he is eightteen years old and he has only one promblem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in toefl to be accepet in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade .the second reasons that make me agree with this statement is the richest man in the world , the microsoft owner .he put an imposible goal that could be reached .he put a risky goal to work on it , 30 years ago the put .his goal was to make every house in the world haveing a computer , and he successed in his goal .how did he success ?it was not an easy goal , he start his dream with his friend by having a small company that make a computer softwear .he was thinking what is the helpful computer programms that could the humanity to be better .and he could to reach his goal to have a computer in every house in the world , beacuse of it is great programms , like the internet explorer that make the conection between all the people in the world very easy and make them feeling that the world is a small village .
