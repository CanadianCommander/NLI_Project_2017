throughout the whole elementary , middle and high school , i have learned both ideas and facts from the school .i have come to realize that whenever i understand the ideas and concepts , i can do so well in the test .however , it does nt mean that i agree on the statement .instead , in my opinion , facts certainly obtain more valuable life experiences for students from their ancestor .in the chinese culture , we have a dialogue : `` reading million books can not be compared to walking million miles  .i think about this statement everytime when i am traveling in somewhere .some might think that this dialogue does nt apply to the statement .however , what i mean with the dialogue is that , the ideas from the book is dead , but experience is something that has once live on world .although understanding the idea may help me to obtain a high math or science score , it is however , not much helpful instead of it .this is my conclusion based upon my three years in united states .i am living in the school domitary .it is a house with eight girls living inside , supervised by a houseparent .the first day of my second year in america , i arrived the house , and it was the beginning of hell .my new houseparent , is , in most of the girls  opinion , the worst human being we have met on earth .it is not the matter of her weird english after more than twenty years in united states , it is not the matter that she cooks bad or enforces rule strictly .as an adult and an counsellor , who should be well-feeded by different ideas and knowledges , she however has favorism on certain girls .out of no reason , she treated me meanly ever since the first day i got there .for instance , she went into my room without knocking on my door , yelled at me for not doing the chrous , which in fact , in not my work .moreover , she absuptly refused my request for leaving my room so that i can get change .in addition , she isolated the house into two groups , and talks behind the back of the group she does nt like .i have learnt since then , that ideas and concepts does nt change a person personality , just as my devil like houseparent , who has been a consellor in publich school , who knows thousand of theories .whenever i was trying to express my idea , she never understand , nor does she ever care about me .i learned fact that talking concepts to her do not help anything .according to my experience , the only way to live happily is to keep my mouth shut .hopefully , this is going to end in two mouthe , .
