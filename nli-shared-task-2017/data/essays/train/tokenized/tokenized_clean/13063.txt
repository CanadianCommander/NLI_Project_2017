i disagree with statement .in my opinion the best way to travel is alone or in a small group of people that have approximately the same degree of knowledge of the region .there are several reasons for my belief .first of all , a tour guide will protect the traveller from most interaction with and exposure to the local inhabitants by organising transportation , accomodation , food etc .this is , of course , convenient and efficient but it often means that the traveller will not use the local language nor will he encounter local customs of communication and everyday life .thus , he misses out on many new experiences and cultural insights .for example , when a friend and i were travelling in turkey on our own , we had to learn a couple of turkish phrases in order to communicate with local peasants , and the priceless reward was that we were invited to stay with the family for a couple of days and experience how life in rural turkey really is like .this would not happen when travelling with a tour guide , using prearranged facilities and no need to talk to the local people .second , a tour guide will have specific ideas on what to show and what to hide of a country .the traveller will only see what is esteemed a cultural highlight , or entertaining , and he will follow the footsteps of many tourists before him .if he travels on his own , he has the chance to leave the usual path and discover the new environment on his own .he is likely to encounter nice as well as unpleasant things but his picture of the local culture will be more balanced and more complete .similarly , travelling without a guide might be less effective in terms of `` visited sights/day  but it will be a more thorough and individual experience .when travelling with a guide one faces the danger of falling into a passive , consuming position where prepared pieces of information are delivered .in summary , travelling alone means active involvement , challenge and individual experience as opposed to the convenience and superficial screening of tourist attractions provided by most guided tours .it depends on the preference of the traveller which form of exploring a new region he chooses but i believe that without a guide the experience is much richer .
