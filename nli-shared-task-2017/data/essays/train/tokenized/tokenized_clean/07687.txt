people react to everyday life in different ways .there are some human beings who prefer to follow the ` known way  in each of the activities they perform .there are some others who always prefer to experience new things and new , probably risky , ways of reacting to problems or stimula from the outside .i firmly believe that these are the people who often demonstrate to be the most succesful in their lives .taking risks and exploiting new solutions are universally recognised as the characteristics of succesful leaders .business world is full of examples of people who took risks and had great success .ceos of the most succesful companies in most of the cases are succesful themselves because they decided not to follow their sheer experience , but to take risks .mr jobs from apple co , for example , put most of the resources of r & d department of his company to exploit a new area of business , the mp3 one , when its company was facing a serious crisis .his decisions were the right ones .history has proved how the perceptions he had about the potentialities of that new product were right .however , the business field is not the only one where people proved to be succesful by trying new things .when talking about italian politics in the early eighteenth century it always appears that the most commonly cited name is the one of marco rossi .this famous politician was considered a fool when he proposed , first in the country , to pass an act to consider to give also to women the right to vote .he took the political risks of his proposal , which was totally new for that period .after that he had worldwide approval and success , just beacuse he took the risk of a new action .anyway not only famous people can be taken as examples .in everyday life there is plenty of normal people that are considered succesful by the ones who know them because they decided to experiment .for example in a small village the first person who moves away to another area or even country is often considered as a hero for his village fellows .as before , he took the risk and tried new things ( i .d : moving ) .this makes the idea of experiencing new routes and things stronger into my mind .being succesful is hard but it is proved that taking reasonable risks and following unexperienced territories helps .this happens not just in famous human beings  lives , but also to normal people .
