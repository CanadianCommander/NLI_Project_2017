transportation vehicles are among the necessities of today s modern urban life .it can be argued that all kinds of transportation vehicles facilitate our lives .it is needless to say that car is the most effective and widely used transportation vehicle today .however , the developments in public transportation and the fluctuations in oil prices bring my mind that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in this essay , the reasons that influence people to change their transportation habit in twenty years will be explained .to begin with , urban life becomes more crowded day by day .as a result of this , people hardly find space to park their cars .in addition , in order to solve transportation problems in urban landscapes , municipalities and other agents develop projects .thanks to these projects , underground systems , municipality buses and other kinds of public transportation are provided .moreover , air transportation is highly developed today .as a fruit of these changes , people prefer public transportation facilities more than they did before .for example , i saw this trend in new york city .although people afford to buy car , they prefer to use public transportation .one of the citizens whom i talked with said that twenty years ago there were more cars in new york city than there are today .therefore , we can say that twenty years later , there will be fewer cars seen on the streets .another factor that affects poeple s choices in terms of transportation is oil prices .oil prices fluctuates every year .thus , people can not predict how much money that they should pay for oil .although oil is relatively cheap in developed countries , its price can be rocketed suddenly .for example , during the gulf war , oil prices increased too much .in short , oil prices is profoundly related to the developments in politics especially in oil prodcing countries .as a result of this unstable structure of ol prices , car become an expensive vehicle for transportation .to sum up , in my opinion in twenty years there will be fewer cars i use than there are today .this will realise because of the developments in public transportation and the unstable prices of oil which make the car an uncomfortable and expensive transportation vehicle .
