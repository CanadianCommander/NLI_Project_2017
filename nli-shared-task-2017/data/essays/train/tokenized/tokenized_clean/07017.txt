most people like to travel .some of them are trying to travel by themselves .on the other hand , rest of them intend to follow a tour guide .both of them have each reasonable advantages .however , i do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .if i have a chance to travel , i will travel alone or with a few friends .firstly , i believe that traveling is to get my own expirence .initially , i know that following a tour guide is more convenience , but i think that purpose of traveling is not being convenience .expiriencing new world and new culture is goal of it .i had two exprience of travel .one of them was travel to japan , and another was travel to u.s. the travel to japan was not to follow a guide .my friends and i made every plan and reservation .surely , it was a little bit difficult but experience that we got at that time made us mentally strongly .on the other hand , travelling to u.s. was fun and easy for a guide , but i did not have any special memory about that trip .secondly , one of meaning of travel is take some space from our regular lives .if we travel alone or with just a few friends , we can do it .but , following a guide should not allow to do it .there are so many plans and events .sometimes those things can make a travel funny , but often those can make it irritating .nobody wants to spend money on meaningless things .if a travelling is a way that make you escape your life and refresh , which one is more helpful ?
