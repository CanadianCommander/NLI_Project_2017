the number of cars in use rappresents a complex variable to study .actually we can describe this variable like a constant expansion as nowadays we can consider car as a status symbol .most of the people uses car everyday and for any reasons , such as going to work , to shop or to holyday .in my opinion now there is not a valide alternative to change this way of life .public transportation , like bus , metro is not efficient as people required : not all city blocks can be easily reached without waste too much time , and vehicle are less comfortable than own car .for these reasons i think that number of cars in use will continue to increase without a serious and global transportation politics .if i go arond i can see the highest percentage of cars occupied from the driver only , familes that have more cars than persons in house , and on the other hand a bad plublic transportation .
