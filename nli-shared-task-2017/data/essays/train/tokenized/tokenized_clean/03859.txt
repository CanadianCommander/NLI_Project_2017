i do not agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because i do not want to waste my money i earned to work hard and ask for quolity of products .because the products i buy is related to my life .if goods is worse than they really are , it affect my life .for example , i often purchase goods such as books or dvd on the internet shop .however , i sometimes disapear goods i bought because they are so old and dirty .so , i will not use them for a long time .when i think of buying electical products , i need durable goods .so , if advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i disapear and must change it soon .the other example , when i bought foods , it is bad taste and too expensive .if i bought inferior goods , i waste monney i earned .i work hard everyday so i want to spend my money on my profit .
