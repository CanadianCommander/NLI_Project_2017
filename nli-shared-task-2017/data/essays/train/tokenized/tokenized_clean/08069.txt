i agree with the opinion thjat young prople og today s world are not that inclined towards community services as was the scenario some decades ago .multifarious factors might have contributed in this gradual change of attitude .factors worth listing include social and political ones .young people theses days are more career oriented .the jobs of today s hustling world consumes most of their time .little is the time they are left with .imagine an employee at some multinational company who has to work day in and day out to survive his post .the stresses and tensions involved and the immense competition at his work place make it almost impossible to get some spare time for himself .and that spare time too has to be divided judicially among family matters , recreation and the list will continue .still , there are people who , inspite of all these offsets , try to contribute as much as they can for community services .but , this is for sure a limiting factor that discourages one to get involved with social services .another fact that might be propounded here , is that over the years there is a gradual chane in the thinking and psycholgical make-up of the society as a whole .for example , a young aspirant who wishes to pay an equal importance to his work , his recreation , his community service , his family , might be let down by his peers who do nt think these ideals fit enough in the modern world .it can be alet down , however , it depends on one s discretion only what to follow then .various organisations have come up all over the world that cater to needs of society .it is true that it is difficult for these organisations to attract young people .rarely do they find individuals who want to work selflessly expecting no exorbitant rewards .the younger generation has many alternatives before it to consider for its livelihood in the developing world of today .the lack of lucre in this field might also be a factor discouraging the younger lot to enter in community services .
