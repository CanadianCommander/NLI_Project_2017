i disagree with this statement .in my opinion , it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .people in these days seem to pay a lot attention to ideas , but the fact is , this made a lot of useless ` inventions  .for this , i saw a new ` invention  the other day .it was a little fan that could be tied on the arm , which could be used for cooling off the hot noodles while people are picking up the noodles .the fan is not tiny , but even if it is , is there really a lot of consumers for this kind of product ?i do not think so .if i were the customer , i wo nt even bring a fan to a restruant just for cooling off the noodles .this is one example for people only get the idea but not the fact .as a matter of fact , many of the concepts and ideas are theories , which just came from hypethosis .if every student do not pay attention to the facts that are in daily life , how will they able to find out or even to do labs without a habit which is called `` to discover themselves  ?ideas and concepts seems to be very important , but if they are just there without facts , i do not think there will be anybody to be able to understand them .it is the twenty-first centry , society and technology are updating everyday , if people only get the ideas and concepts on the text book instead of getting the facts , they will not be able to fit in this society very well , due to their lacking of methods that will work the best and creativity .and those methods and creativity are mostly came from the fact that they have ` stored  day by day .` students  now are the ` people  in the future .that is why i think it is a lot more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to only understand ideas and concepts .
