i will totally agree that it is really it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .understanding ideas and concepts has led to new inventions in the modern life .it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .for example newton s law of motion which is the basis of physics .newton s law of motion can only be understood when the person actually understand the logic behind .one of his law states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .this concept can only be understood when you do it practically .just by learning the fact does not pays .when this concept is used in practical labs , the concepts become more clear .the person will never forget these concept throughout his lifetime when implied practically .another perfect example which tells that understanding ideas and concepts are really important .everyone of us know about , the value of accerlation due to gravity .this value was established by sir newton .everybody knows that value because it is a learned fact .he found this value while putting his ideas and concepts .he was sitting under an apple tree .the apple fell from the tree and newton started thinking about the speed at which might the apple have felled .he conducted many practical experiments which lead to the value .hence it shows how important is to understand ideas and concept .another example will be that of telesa , one of the best electrical engineers .it was his concepts and ideas that developed the principle of alternating currents .because of this , power can be transmitted to long places .so it is really important to have stress on understanding ideas and concepts .in the end , i think it is really important for the student to give stress on understanding ideas .they should put stress on the concepts that developed those facts .by stressing on concepts and ideas , new modern technologies will be developed and that will be an advantage for human life .
