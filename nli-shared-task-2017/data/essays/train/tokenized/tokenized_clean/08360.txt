i disagree with this statement .actually it s true that understand ideas and concepts are important for students .however , even the students have those things , i think the learning does not work without the learning facts for the students .when i was in grade 7 and 8 , i could not success with my study that much , because i did not try to study hard at the time .however , i was changed my mind by my mother s words when i was in grade 9 .and i could think that i have to study and if i study i will get good marks than before .since then i studied hard , and my effort was permitted from my teachers .and my marks was getting high like i have ever seen or i could not imagine before .when i got the report card from those teachers , they wrote some masseges for my mother about me on the report .and it said `` she changed a lot in this year .i knew that she is a person who have good unerstanding knowlegdes and nice learner , but she did nt try to work hard before .so her marks were low , but she tried to study so hard in this year .i felt she grew up little bit , and i am glad to see her many great ideas and imaginations and also i felt her good attitudes in those classes .i learned from your daugnter that even if we have good qualities , if we did nt think we want to show the qualities , the good qualities never get great qualities .when i saw the massages , i felt so happy and i thought i will keep studying hard for me , my family who support me , and those teachers who i got when i was in junior high .from my experience , i think it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for students to understand ideas and cocepts .
