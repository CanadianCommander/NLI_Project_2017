i think i agree with this statement .as far as i am concerned , i think that there are two ideas which can support this statement .first , recently environmental protection awareness has been rising rapidly .people nowadays realize that ailr pollution is getting worse and worse because of cars .thus , in order to give thier generations a better environment to live , people may begin to decrease driving cars to the places they want to go .insteaed , they will start choosing public transportation , such as mrt , tran , and bus , to get to the place they need to go .moreover , the payment for a car is not cheap at all .for example , when you get a car , you have to pay for the oil and repairment .i dare to say it will cost you much money than spending money on taking public tranportations .second , oil is becoming less and less though scientists have done thier best to dig oil and find where oil can be .oil is one kind of natural resources and the formation of oil must be very long , so it is not limtless .however , oil is essential for cars .without it , people can not start cars at all ; then , people will reduce using cars step by step .i think that the above i write can explain why there will be fewer cars than today .just remember that quantity of oil is limted and one day it will be gone , and the government have spent amouts of money on establishing public tranportations .where do the governmet get the money to create pubic facilities ?it is from peolpe who pay taxes .so , we , people , have to enjoy what we have invested and keep a better lives for our next
