in my opinion , there are both , advantages and disadvantages about trying new things and taking risks .some people might feel relunctant to change methods of a successful company , others might feel more open about it .i used to be the person who does not take a lot of risk in the past , but recently my attitude has changed .i think that being successful in life , just can be achieved by trying new things and taking risks .for example , a member of a football team .if he just reacts and plays safely meaning making no faults , he can not get a better soccer player .he just stays at his level , but does not become a professional player one day .a soccer player who wants to achieve someting , has to take risk .this risks can be changing the soccer team where he has stayed for five years to a successul , better team where he does not know the members , the coach or the surrounding of this team .taking risks and trying new things can also have some negative aspects .if you take risks , there will always be the opportunity to make it wrong , to loose something .but if you do not make faults , you wo nt learn about things and decisions you made .an example for a sport where you can not take any risks is the formula one .the race drivers can not take risks , because every fault can cause death for them .so , the level of taking risk for car pilots in the formula one , is very low .they have to drive successful , meaning driving fast , but it is very important for them and their team to drive safely .to sum it all up and to summarize my opinion about the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than onlz doing what they already know how to do well  , i would say that successful people have to take risks , but there are some situations or some jobs where zou have to do what zou have learned .
