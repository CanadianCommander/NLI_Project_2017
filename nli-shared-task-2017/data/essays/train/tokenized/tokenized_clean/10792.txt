i strongly agree with the statement which successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do wel .i have three things to support my opinion .first of all , people tend to like new things very much .once people get used to with something , people often look foward new things .for example , i pod is one of the new technology and is very popular product in the u.s today .before i pod was produced , people satisfied with cd player , but once i pod has been on the market , no one would go to buy cd player anymore .moreover , people are already looking forward new version of i pod even having a newest i pod .therefore , people like new things more than old things .another reason is that we need to creat and try to make a new things which did not exist before because life does not stay and go back to the past .a life is always going forward .to keep producing the same products which exists already does not change any thing .we have to have new things to live a life more usufully .car is one of the examples .if we dont have a car in the u.s , how can we live in this country ?everyone has to live in the town , and no one wants to live country side because of unconvinience .people are required to make new things to satisfy people s wants and needs .finally , to compete with others , i think there would be needed to have new things even if taking risks .if everyone has the same , there is no way to win the competition .to win the competition , having a new things which does not have others becomes very strong point .taking risks is needed to make and try new things .in my country , there is the word that `` high risk , high return  .what this means is that taking high risks would lead higher returen later on .from these reasons , i strongly agree with the statement .in a everyone s life , we can not stop there .we have to move onto forward to successful life .
