there are some reasons to believe that yuong people enjoy life more than older people do but , personally , i think that nowadays it is nt so .in my opinion yuong people want to enjoy their life but they want a lot of things and resoult is that they do nt fell happy never .on the other hand old people , actually not very older , have a good experience to enjoy their life whit a lot of things .i believe this because they have a lot of possibility , such as more free time than yuong people and more money .i think that in this society money is very important for everythings because this helps yuo to enjoy yuor life .for example yuo can go on holiday where yuo want .instead young people ca nt because they need an allow of parents and they must go to scholl .so they ca nt go on holiday where they want .also this topic depend on the bheviour of people because there are a lot of different character .in my experience i m sure that my life is more interesting today than when i was very yuong .i feel this because i have a life experience that helps me to grow up better .when i was teenagers i had problems that now i fell stupid .for this reason i could nt enjoy my life in the past , but now it is all different .i enjoy my life whit my friends , for example to go dinner togheter or to go dancing .i prefer simple situation because to enjoy my life i don-t need a lot but only my friends .uin conclusion , i think that it is important for the life that everybody fells well and consequently yuo can enyoj your life every day better .
