imagine walking through the costa rican tropical forest with one s closest friends .as you march through the various types of plants and life-forms , you encounter the rarest type of bird in all of costa rica : the `` mancha roja  .its astounding colors amaze you and you re friends to such a point that you become frozen on the spot .such a scene would not be frequently seen with the structured group tours guided by an expert .it is obvious that when one drifts away from the traditional ideas and creates one s own pathways , one will discover new and amazing things that would have otherwise been hidden .if one does not separate from the typical behavior produced by human nature , society would still be living under medieval age conditions and no true discoveries would be made .it is essential to think outside the box in order to get the best from an experience .if one uses a tour guide to explore and discover the riches of our world , one will not be truly discovering the hidden treasures but instead be following a simple lesson .if that is what one truly seeks , then maybe a textbook would be more cost-efficient than an expensive tour guide .with this conservative attitude of following someone around , thomas alva edison would not have discovered the lightbulb , or the wright brothers would not have soared in the skies .in order to see the unseen , it is key to make one s own path and explore , try new things and base one s opinion and thinking upon that , rather than on a tour guide that one does nt even know .going back to the initial example of the mysterious bird , if one had walked along the amazon with a group of people , that bird might have been scared away by unfamiliar noises .one would have missed out on what could have been the most enlightening and fabulous experience of years of exploration .had one gone along the inexistent path , one might have seen this bird along with many other incredible animals , therefore the pre-written path does not lead to discovery and hence must not be followed .creating our own paths in life is absolutely vital to the enrichment of our minds .following a group , led by a tour guide , into the unknown can not even be compared to the experience of entering the unknown without direction or expectations .without a doubt , the best way to travel is , and always will be , traveling through the rugged , virgin and unexplored paths .
