productivity and profits are the core aspects of our economy , this way , companies advertized to improve the image of their products .the result is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .they emphase on the main quality of their product in order to be attractive and of course do nt focus on the defects , or less attractive effects .fisrt of all , advertisements are maid to spread the knowledge on a specific product , in order for the customer to buy it .of course it has to be attractive and to show specific abilities .it can look much better than it really is .for example , take the pills that reduce the weight , it commounly sells miracles as one is supposed to loose kilos in one week .that seems great , and someone willing to loose a size would be tented .the advert does nt explain that it must be associated with a strict diet to be effective , and customers will certainly be disapointed .on the other hand , it wo nt be as effective if they expose how it really works , people will be more carefull , and the main purpose of the advertisement wouldt be reached in terms of quantities .but it also true that a satisfied customer will easily purchase again the product , and have a better effect in the length .for example , the yogurt that explains they reduce not only the fat but also the sugar , and taste good , is explaining everything about the diet , in contradiction with a lot of produts that claim they are 0 percen fat but contain a lot of sugarsthe customer can also ask for advice before purchasing and thus have a real idea of the product .he can also compare different products and choose the one that matches his requierements .most advertisements make the products look better , but the customer is aware that everything is not said or explained , he must read between the lines and use his personal experience and knowledges .
