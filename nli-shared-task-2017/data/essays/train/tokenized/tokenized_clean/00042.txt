do young people enjoy life more than older people ?i believe the answer is `` no  .i believe both young and older people can enjoy their lives equally , however , the ways of enjoying the life are quite different .young people tend to enjoy their lives from activies which older people can not handle very well .for example , young people like to party alot .they drink , dance , and hang out with their friends all night long .this is one way of young people to appriciate their healthest time in their lives .also , some other young people like to play sports , games , and music .for example , i am in a band and i play guitar .i love to play my guitar with my band .we `` rock and roll  with music we play .on the other hand , older people enjoy life by walking a park , hiking , or chatting with their friends .as i observe my grandparents it seems like older people enjoy beautiful environments such as sound of a bird or color of the sky .they take the advantage of the environment to the fullest .oider people appriciate the beautiful mother nature that god has created for humans .also , they enjoy their companies .older people can not do extreme activities like young people do ; they have a little enjoyable conversation with their friends .as i decribed the differences in ways that young people enjoy life and older people enjoy life through specific examples , i believe anybody can enjoy life regardless of age .the `` age  is just a number .it is very rude and disrepectful to think `` oh . ..because they are old , they ca nt have fun .older people have already enjoyed their lives like young people 30 years ago .in conclusion , i strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .are nt you going to enjoy your life when you are older ?
