i think that today , there are a lot of students that want to study and in this way they could have a better future .i believe that it is easier to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is also true that it is very important to know facts because it could be usefull in our lives .therefore it is up to us to understand what we want to do .there are differnt types of thinking about it , but i reckon that for a student to understand ideas and concepts is more and more important and simple copared to learn facts .for instance i m an architect and when i was a student i discussed a lot with my teachers about this problem .i wanted only to understand ideas because i considerded very difficult to remember facts and other things .today i think that to understand concepts and to learn facts should be important for all of us and each one shoud make it better .
