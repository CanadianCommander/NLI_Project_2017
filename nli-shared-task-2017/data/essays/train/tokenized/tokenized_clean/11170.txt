do you remember everything you studied ?probably not !however , if you once studied a subject in depth you will probably have experienced that the lessons drawn from that studying have had long-lasting effects .specializing in a specific study subject is a great choice , since this will allow the student to trully enjoy the subject , to acquire a profound knowledge of it and , ultimately , to apply this knowledge to further subjects of study .when someone studies something in depth , he usually enjoys the subject more than when his or her study is superficial .how can someone for instance enjoy history , when it is taught only as facts and dates ?conversely , a deep knowledge of the context and causes of historic events , may make the study of history an amazing and exiting experience .furthermore , a thorough study of a specific subject allows the student to retain the subject more easily , because the knowledge so acquired has deeper roots .we have surely all experienced the contrary : trying to embrace many subjects for our school exams and ultimately forgetting everything once the exams had passed .by studying someting in depth , the chances of this frustrating experience will significantly decrease !moreover , the best about studying a subject in-depth is that , once we have a sound knowledge of a certain topic , we can draw links and establish relationships with other topics .this makes the studying of further topics more simple .my best friend majored in art . ..you will probably not be surprised that he is also terrific in history , since any art expression is closely related to the historical context in which it took place .for all these reasons , i strongly recommend everyone specialize in a specific subject , rather than try to gain a broad knowledge of many subjects .the only question is , in which subject should someone specialize ?
