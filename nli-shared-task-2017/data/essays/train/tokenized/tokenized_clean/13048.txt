in my opinion the most important thing for a student is not to learn facts , even though it should be useful , but to understand ideas and concepts .when somebody try to learn a fact he can do a lot of things in a wrong way : for instance he can forget it after few years , or he can also alter some essential parts of it .the result is to change the fact and alter completely the meaning of the information received .this can led to problems of understanding and , in the worsen cases , to bigger crisis .this is the nature of the fact , somethink closely linked to our memory and therefore on something we can not completely rely .facts could also change as new facts come out or new proof are considered .what we should never avoid is the understanding of concepts and ideas .everybody can forget something that has previously learned but nobody can forget his own ideas .while facts are not part of our brain or of our spirit , ideas are the most secret part of us .students should be educated to understand the ideas of philosophers , politicians , poets , writers etc. because in this way they can catch the real spirit of men .to make an example everybody can learn a poem but after few years a lot of people can start to forget it , but the idea hidden in the poem it will never be forgot .on one hand facts can change or can be altered by the time or by new discoverings they are the material part of the world , on the other hand ideas are the spiritual part of our world , the part which will live forever .students should learn this main point : the real image of a person can not be understand by facts but only by his ideas .
