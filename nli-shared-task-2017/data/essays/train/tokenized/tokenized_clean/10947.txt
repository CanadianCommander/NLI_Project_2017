i agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .typically , young people are healthier and thus they have more opportunity to pursue different activities like bungee jumping , parasailing , gliding and others which provide a stimulation and a difference to the usual routine of the lives of people .young people are also not usually weighed down with the responsibilites of family life .thus they are able to go on adventures and undertake risky projects with complete enthusiasm and lack of fear .climbing mount everest , going on a jungle safari ride , going racing with friends on cars are some of the activities that older people are scared to undertake as they get on in life .when people are young , say in college , they usually have a gang of friends with whom pursuing different activities becomes a lot of fun .but as time goes on , they get married and have children .slowly they start losing contact with their college friends and it no longer becomes possible to go on trips as happy-go-lucky bachelors .now if they go on trips , they do so with their family and this gives a totally different and more serious outlook compared to going with friends .when young , people are not concerned a lot about saving money .so they do nt mind spending money and going on trips frequently .but older people realize that trips are not essential , but providing for the future of the family is .so they decide to restrict their activities and spend only on what is essential and save the rest for the future .finally one can say that a person is only as old as he thinks he is .so if a person thinks he is young in mind , he can have fun no matter what the age .it s the attitude of the person that counts when you want to have fun , not the actual number of years you ve lived on earth !!all these reasons thus support the view that the younger you are , the more fun you can have !
