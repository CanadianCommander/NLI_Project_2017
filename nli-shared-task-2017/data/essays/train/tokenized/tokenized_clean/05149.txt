in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use thene ther are today .some people agree with thes statment and some do nt .there are many advanteges and disadvanteges for it .the advanteges of having cars or not are many such as the air polution will be less because many people will use bicks .the second thing is people will not need to pay for gas every week .the weather in my country is very hot so we must use cars espsialy is summer and that is a disadvanteges of not having cars .at the end my opinion is that i disagree with this statment because the weather is to hot in my country and no one can walk or us a bick is such a hot weather .
