i agree in part with the statement , but i do nt think that those are the only two characteristics a successful person has .in my opinion , those characteristics are strongly associated , if not derived , from self-confidence .a person that is self-confident is not afraid of trying new things and taking risks .in a way it has to be a person that knows that whatever happens there is always a way to make things work .on the other hand , i disagree in part with the statement because there is a good amount of people who have success and not necessarly take risks or try new things , in fact they do what they know well or are especialized in .could it be that success is associated sometimes to luck ?there has been a lot of people , throughout history that they had a good idea , but it was nt the moment and years later it became a reality .in my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variaty of factors should come together , such as , personality traits , knowledge and the moment or period of time he or she is born .success involves a large scope .a person may be successful in his or her professional life but he or she is a failure in social aspects .taking risks and trying new things may be applicable and a desirable characteristic for a person that runs a business , but i strongly disagree that it will be a desirable trait in a relationship .so , to call a person successful i consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person s life and in order to have success characteristics do nt limit only in taking risks and trying new things .
