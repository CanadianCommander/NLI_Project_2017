some people believe that in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today .in my opinion , however , more and more cars will appear .because car is very comfortable opts and people want their own car as the country is more developed .using car is very comfortable .a lot of people can feel that .as more developing internet and information , people knows many beautiful regions and want to go .of course , using car is only way to go anywhere , but car is the most convinient and the most comfortable .for example , my family want to go cosmos festival that is advertised beautifully in one website .there is very countyside so there are not public transportation .so my family choose my father s car .because of the car , all of my family members can enjoy the cosmos ( one species of fall flower ) festival .this illustrates the importance of being easy when they use car .car is more and more increas as people look for their being comfortable .also , many young people want their own car as time goes by .young people , like college students are more known about date routes and place they enjoy in being not disturbed .moreover , society is gradually private , so people want their private car , not their family car .for instance , my boy friend wants to bring me to the east sea .he said , people who have been east sea tell a story about beautiful scene .i very want to go , but we have no car .my father s and his father s cars are limited .as a result , we gave up that nice plan .after then , my boy friend and i always hope to have my own car .this illustrates why people want to have their own car .for these reasons , i think although time goes by , cars are more increasingly .car is very comfortable means and something like treasure for young people .
