i totally agree with the statement , i think it is very important for students to learn and understand ideas and concepts , that stand behind the facts .studying history for example , we re better know why the first and the second world war happened , than knowing how every single country organized its trupes for the conflict .what i reffear to is the importance of communicate what are the reasons of the facts instead of knowing mererly what happened that day .going on with the example of historic issues , it has a great relevance to understand the reasons , the ideologies , all the complex contest in which a fact is in . ..even becouse we are supposed to learn about those ways of thinking that led ancient people , and contemporary people to great successes , and to great disasters . .what was the thread running through these events , how some dictators were able to strike a chord in people . ..that is what should be widely unsderstood .if we consider other matters , like studying mathematics or phisical and scientific studies , i still believe that is more important to understand how to get to a certain theory than learning only that formula .moreover , as a matter of fact , we tend to forget mostly of things we learn by chance , but we easily remember what we totally understood , becouse we undestood the mental process to get to that particular solution .in conclusion , learning the concepts and the ideas , we developp our mental and logical functions .this helps not only in succeed to examinations and testes , but in every single thing we do in our life
