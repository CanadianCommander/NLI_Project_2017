i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the first reason is that the car is necessary to do most of tha activity that a person does .for example , if a person wants to go to swim and the swimming pool is far from his home , he take his car to go there .the car is very important for the family .infact parents need the car to bring their child to school or to go shopping .another reason that i think will make the number of cars increase is price of them .infact forty years ago , for example , cars were very expensive and so only a part of the population could buy one .today there are lot of different models of car and almost any family can buy a car .i think that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use also because they are reaching a very high comfort level .today a person can have a long trip without arriving tired .another reason is that cars are being more and more safe .for example twenty years ago if someone have to make a long trip he probably had taken the train .infact if a person had an accident with an old car he probably hurt himself seriously .for these reasons i think that in next twenty years the number of cars will encrease a lot .
