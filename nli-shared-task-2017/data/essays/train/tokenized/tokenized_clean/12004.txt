the statements touches upon a very contraversial topic .it is true that young people spend more time on parties and traveling than the old people .however , i completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .i have many reasons for my belief .it is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world .but it is equally true that not only physical activities , but also other activities contribute to the definition of `` enjoying life to its fullest  .to give an example , i had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exams and standadised tests out side the syllabus .although he was retiered , he had a true passion for maths and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzles and do recreational mathematical work .apart from mathematics , he also had a group of friends , with whom he used to play cards and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess .he also kept visiting his two sons once every year and taught his grandsons the secretsof leading a successful life .from all these and many more activities , he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life .on the otherhand , consider the yonger generation , where many people commit numerous crimes in the name of having fun in life .these people suffer severely , when they have to face the punishments offered by the law for their arrogant attitude .we can find numerous examples of young people commiting inexcusable crimes and facing the punishment for life .on the contrary , in such cases the young people have to face more sorrows in life than the old people do .i strongly believe , that to enjoy life , one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows , in whatever small ways possible .on can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself .and i strongly believe there is no age limit to do this , and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life .
