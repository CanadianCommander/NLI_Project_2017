power , money and reputation are very desirable things , and if you are successful in your job , you probably have them all .due to that , success plays an important role in our life .the question arises , how to be successful .you could try new things and take a risk , or you could focus on what you already know how to do well .in my opinion , you can be successful with both strategies .on the one hand there are lots of companies which improved an already existing successful product .for instance apple .they choose the normal mp3 player and improved the storage capacity , the handling , the design and named it ipod .due to the improvements and a huge marketing campaign , they sold an incredibly high number of ipods all over the world .the success of this product was outrageous !on the other hand , remember the foundation story of the apple company - an almost perfect example for creating a new market .with the computer for common households , they invented a completly new product and took a high risk .as we all know , the product was accepted by the market and had an enormous impact on the society .there are numerous other examples for both strategies and therefore i disagree with the statement that people who try new things are more successful than people who do what they already know to do well .because of the high risk , i would rather tend to focus on things which i do well , and where i know very well how to operate .
