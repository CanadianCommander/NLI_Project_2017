learning should be based on ideas and conceptsmastering the ideas and concepts are essential part of learning .i completely believe that ideas and concepts is much more important for the students than just focusing on the facts .there are several reasons for this .first of all , understanding the ideas provides a stimulus to the brain and helps positive thinking , learning and mastering of the subject .with the concept being understood , one can apply these ideas to any similar situation .it is much easier to connect one idea to another and build a logical conclusion about a subject or theory .secondly , understanding the facts also needs some ideas to fully grasp the knowledge of the subject .without any idea or logical stream of thought behind , it will be very difficult even to understand why a fact actually happened .focusing only on the fact and not looking at the underlying concept is like building something without a solid foundation .understanding the concept behind a particular theory also allows to deal with unexpected situations in a better way .for example , if somebody know the concept behind a mathematical theory , one can easliy solve any problem without memorizing the contents or facts of the problem .similarly understanding concepts of physics allows a person to apply the same principals to a variety of situations and provide useful explanations .understanding the ideas & concepts also promotes further learning .it is easier to teach a subject to others if one has mastered the ideas and concepts behind it .lastly , understanding the ideas and concepts helps the development of the subject itself .with the concepts fully understood , one can then build more useful ideas over them .these ideas then become part of the subject or theory itself and make the application of the theory to real life more useful .
