eessential way to succeed is trying new things with less risks .therefore , i disagree that successful people try new things and take risks .succcessful people to eager to get knowledge as much as possible and pay effort all the time .that s why they look like that they try things what they already know how to do well .moreover , they tend to be careful to challenge new thing such as business and sports .before they start dsomething , they imagine and exmaine .them , when they have confidence , they callenge it .for example , successful first food chain company exmins how many and what kinds of people walk arround the area where they want to open the new store .people who try new thins takng lots of lisks are sometimes fascinating people .in addition , they rarely success .nevertheless they succeed in the past , they tend to be fail someday .for exmample , some succeeded internet business owner losts their all money suddenly .their cuccess was based on the fassion of society and business tendency .unfortunatelly , they misunderstood the way to scucceed .therefore , they used tons of mney they got before to something new business .i believe taht success always bring the people basen on their effort .pople who did theiyr best are always less risks .therefore trying new thing s witought risks are tip to be success .
