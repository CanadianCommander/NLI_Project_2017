i disagree with the statement that the successful people do not try new things and they use their preveous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task .one of the example i can remember of this is that a girl who always sit with me in my lunch period .she always worked very hard and i could see that she was a successful person and also will be in the future from what i saw of her .one day when she was doing her homework in front of me , i could not even tell what she was studying since it seemed like a difficult thing to me , she asked me if i could understand the question asking in the homework .i told her the it is impossible for me to figure out the problem she ca nt even figure out .so she asked me what she should do so i told her to ask her classmates and ask them what they have answered .but she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the people are not very intelegent as she so she can not take a risk .that response was beyond my expectance of what she would say .my personal thought was to ask a friend or two so she get a feeling of how she should answer the question but since she thinks she knows what to do more than the others , she did not want to take a risk of getting the answer wrong .in a way , i think since it s just a homework assignment , she can just ask people around her .to this question , asking me if i disagree with the successful people try to take a risk , i totally disagree because successful people have a pride more than average people so i assume they take the way they think are right .
