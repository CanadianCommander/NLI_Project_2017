in today s society , which is characterized by a hectic way of life , the desire of going everywhere employing fewer and fewer time has dominated the transportation market .the result is that in recent years the number of cars used has increased spectacularly .but , will this trend continue in the following years ?this is a very controversial issue .on one hand , the enviromental problems and future supply shortage are pushing governments to face the transportation problems in different ways .on the other hand , there are a big and powerful industry which will make hard to abandon the systems based on fossil fuels .in my opinion , the current situation is bad enough to compell society to offer alternative solutions to this problem which will result in the decrease of the number of cars .to begin , the amount of fossil fuels available is decreasing very rapidly .therefore , some time in the future will be no oil or gas .this is a cogent argument which should compell governments to take some measures to prevent that situation .this opens up a bunch of alternative possibilities to provide another means of transportation different from cars .the first solutions should focus in reducing the use of fossil fuels .this include enhance the use of public transportation , foster the use of bycicles in cities and so on .further solutions will take into account the substitution of fossil fuel dependent cars .the new technology develop to overcome this problem will result in new types of machines , which can be similar to cars , but will be no longer the traditional cars .another crucial point , is the enviromental issue .during the last years more and more people are aware that the use of cars contribute highly to the pollution .in fact , in some big cities , such as mexico d.f. and milan , strict measures had to be taken in order to reduce the air pollution .such measures include restriction in the acces to the center , in the days of the week one can take the car , etc .in conclussion , all the possible solutions indicates that a reduction in the number of cars circulating need to take place .summing up , keeping in mind all the problems mentioned above , it is clear that the current trend regarding the use of car can not be held .enviromental , social and technology arguments indicate that new means of transportation will gradually take the place of today s cars .therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will be definitely less than the number of cars used today .
