it seems possible to affirm that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are .however , one must not forget that that is the `` nature of the beast .after all , companies hire a multi-billion dollar machinery to convince us , avid consumers , of our need to look just like the perfect models from suburbia that are used not only to sell products , but also to use our vanity and lust to lure us to buy , buy , buy .let me give you an example of the way advertisment companies use our desire to look great and to be desired to make us buy their products .two days ago i went to the movie theater .while i was waiting for my movie to begin , i was bombarded by a miriad of commercials advertising all sorts of products , all the way from beauty creams to cigarrettes .after the third commercial with the sporty type advertising gym clothing , a membership to a trendy sports facility and the required pills to burn fat , i was feeling fat , grossly inadequate , and ready to run so that i could get all i needed to get on the right track .all of a sudden , a deep realization struck me : all of that can not be real !i can exercise to the point of exhaustion , get all the right clothing , take all the prescribed pills -- not by a medical doctor , mind you -- and even then , i will never look like the blonde , blue-eyed , muscular guy on the screen .do nt believe me yet ?just ask yourself : how many curvacious women or apollinean guys have greeted you at the car dealership last time you bought a new car ?some people would like to say that advertisements are nothing but a clear reflection of the products they offer .while i am willing to concede that there is just little you can do to make a glass of milk look more apetizing than what it is , one has only to look at the `` got milk ?  advertisements to get the point : to advertising companies , it does not matter if what they are offering is as good as they say it is , or even if the attention of the consumer is not so much on the product they are selling but on the personality they are using to advertise it , what matters to them is that it sells .how many times have you been moved to get the trendiest , newest , more expensive brand of clothing , cellular phone , car , etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that , in spite of all the empty promises and alluring techniques used by the advertising company , what you got is nothing but apiece of trash ?think about the famous marlboro commercials .how many people thought that smoking was a fancy activity just by looking at the romantic sunset with the cowboy looming on the horizon ?how about the effects of smoking on your health ?care to talk about cancer and related illnesses ?obviously , truth-telling and advertising do not go hand-in-hand .most advertisement companies want one thing and only one : to sell their clients  products .if they need to lie , modify , or even disguise the real product or its effects in order to sell it , that is exactly what they will do .got milk lately ?
