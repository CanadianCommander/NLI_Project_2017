the world is changing day by day and the change is rapid .in this competitive world we face many issues for which we must have lot of knowledge on every aspect which we come across in our education but it is not possible to have lot of knowledge on every subject .so , atleast we must have a broad knowledge on academic subjects .i support to the idea to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects by giving few examples .there are many advantages for my supporting to broad knowledge of many academic subjects .for example think , i am working on a project which is related to derivative controls .for this project if i do specialization on one particular subject i ca nt do the whole project because i have to know communication theories , signals and systems and some software programming languages in addition to electrical technology .if i do specialization in only one subject how can i do the whole project .furthermore , to study only one particlar subject it is very difficult to get progress in that subject because it may leads to loss of interest and more over after completing half if i think i am not suitable to that area my time and resources are wasted and if i continued without any interest there will be no satisfaction in job which i do relating to that subject .moreover , after my cource work i have to go for a job and the company wants me to work in different areas in different times which makes me difficult if i am specialized in one subject and i ca nt say my manager `` i ca nt work  .in addition to that i myself will be having a great scope of choosing my own area inaccording to the time if i have broad knowledge on different subjects .in totally , i support to the statement that there must be a broad knowledge on all academic cources than getting specialized in one specific subject .
