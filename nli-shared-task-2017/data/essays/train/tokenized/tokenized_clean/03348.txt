i do not agree on this statement .i do not think it is best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are a lot of way to travel in our life .for example , to travel alone , to do with your friends or family , and packed tours with strangers ( such a way in the statement ) .in various ways , if i could travel anywhere , i would like to travel alone .it is best for me not to mind others even if it is my family , friends or boy friend .when you walk with someone , you should catch up with him or her .and , fllowing , you can not the thing you want to look if you have something you want .it is too unpleaseant for me .so , when i want to buy something , i will go shopping alone .this is same in case of travel .i want to go places i want .if someone and me want to go to same place , maybe i will concider well .on oppsition , the demerit that i thought when you travel in a group led by a tour guide .it is semilar to the case of my former reason that i do not go shopping with someone .a tour guide always can provide with a satisfied content to each us .a big tour can not response to each needs of each customer .it is problem for me .
