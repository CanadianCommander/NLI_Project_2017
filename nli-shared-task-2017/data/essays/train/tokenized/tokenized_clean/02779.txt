is understanding ideas and concepts more important for students than learning fact ?this question is quite hard to answer .to give an opinion on this topic , we will discuss these points with the use of examples .first of all , understanding ideas and concepts is crucial .how can you understand an issue when you do nt know anything about the subject ?you must know the basic ideas and concepts .let s take an example : the war in the middle east , to get your own opinion on this issue you must know what has been going on there , you have to understand the concepts and ideas of the area .another example could be found in economics , you have to understand how a company works in order to manage it well .thus , ideas and concepts are essential in education , they are the base of your knowledge like the first bricks of a wall .on the other hand , facts are important too .they help you to understand the concepts and ideas , they provide you further information .they are the painting on the wall , sometimes useful but not essential .moreover , i do nt think learning facts is an interesting way of learning .how can you analyze the facts that you just have learnt when you do nt know the concepts and ideas underneath ?that s why i think learning facts is nt as crucial as understanding ideas and concepts for a student .to sum up , i agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ..time should be increased on understanding concepts and ideas more than learning facts , nonetheless we sould nt neglect facts , even if they are not vital to build our knowledge , they still add something more .
