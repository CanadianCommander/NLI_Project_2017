i agree on this statement .i think people loose stenght and other physical ability as they get older and also they loose free time to have fun .young people can enjoy there time without any matter of money or time .i think that older people does not have time to enjoy life .what they have in mind is the reponsibility of there family and the worry of of children , so they need to work work and work for their family .if they stoped working no one will help your family nor your self .this belief is a common sence to teenager .we all believe that people working does not have the extra stenght to entertain their self .on the contrary , teenager have both the srenght and time .we use our time luxurious as it seems eternal .we do not have to think of responsibility .therefore what we do in our dily life is to have fun everiday any minute , and do not think about the future .we use our time only to entertain our selves .teenagers are free to do any thing .most of the teenager in japan think to enjoy life .young people still have not seen the hardness of life because they still do not have the responsibility .but i think that is not bad .young people can use that time freely to get mature .the young age is filled with experiences and their experiences makes their life so enjoyabl
