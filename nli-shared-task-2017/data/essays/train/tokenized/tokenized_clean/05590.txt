cars are one of the devices or tools that we use to commute from one place to another .if we want to find out `` what will be the fate of cars in the next coming twenty years  we have to cosider the technological , natural changes that can take place in this time period .i agree with the prediction that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today by considering the technological revolutions or natural changes that have a great probablity to happen .technology is progressing day by day and we are getting a great invention of science in the period of two or three years .taking this fact into the account , we can think of the time when most of us will use aeroplanes or some other vehicles to travel from one place to other and fewer cars .our natural resources such as food and water , are becoming scarce because of their exploitation by human being and his intervention in the ecological system in a bad manner .and the resources may reach upto the level when only few people will have access to these and people will not be able to afford expensive vehicles such as cars at that time due to limited money .and this will result in decrement of people using cars .also in predicting the future of cars , we can not neglect the calamities and disasters that may happen in the time period specified .for example , an earthquake that destroys the whole human civilization on earth comes and some of the people survive this disaster .they have to restart the whole work from the scratch .and , they may not be able to reproduce devices like cars to travel from one place to other or at that time it may not become cost effective to have more number of cars than there are today .in summary , taking into account the great technological progress that is going on and the exploitation of natural resources by the human being at a fast pace , we can predict the future of the cars as being used in lesser numbers in the coming twenty years .
