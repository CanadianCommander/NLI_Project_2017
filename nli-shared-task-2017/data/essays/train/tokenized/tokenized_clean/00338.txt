there is a vibrant debate nowadays on whether it is better to know many academics subjects at a broad level rather than specialize in one specific subject .even if i understand the importance of knowing something well and in depth , i agree wirh the statement that it is better to study as many subjects as possible during schools and college time .the following are the three main supporting reasons to my position .first , i think that the role of education is to give to students as many information as possible , in order to give them at least a general view on all the important topics and areas .for example , students too focused on one area might be in troubles to get along in group of other students discussing other topics and they might miss something they actually really like .second , studying many academic subjects give the students the opportunity to understand what they really like in order to make sure they choose a carrer that fits with their interestes .this is important to avoid situations in which students realize that they do nt actually want to work all their life in the area they specialized in and it causes them to be not preparare dto a carrer shift because they lack knowledge in other areas .finally , my third supporting point is related to the social life of people .when people get specialized in one specific subject , they might even win a nobel prize in their area of study but there is the risk that they lack important knowledge which are necessary to enjoy everyday social life .let s think to someone who spent her entire life in a laboratory without any other interests : he might definetly be a great scientist but he may fell unconfortable in partecipating in discussion of other topics ( i.e. history , politics , arts ) ; when it happened , people might have problems in getting along with other during social events , like theatres , museums and all the other networking events that are so importnat in everyone s life .in conclusion , i agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects and the points made above sustain this thesis in a both personal and professional perspective .
