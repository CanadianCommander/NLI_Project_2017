in modern society , we always face the dilemma whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .it is such a debated problem in that it effects everybody in our life .according to different backgrounds , people may have quite different choices .some may frown to it , because they think if they specialize in one specific subject , they can achieve more success , .while others may say yes , since they perfer to contact with all kinds of knowledge .when it comes to me , i tend to agree with the second opinion , that is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .to start with , broad knowledge is quite essential in social communication .there is no denying that human are social beings , we need to communicate with others .but it takes all sorts to make a world , some are teachers , some are doctors , and others may be scientists .if we have no knowledge of other fields except your own learning area , it can be quite different to makes friends with them .you may even do not know how to start a conversation , it can be quite frustrated .besides communication , there is another important point .in certain times , some knowledge in other area is needed in our daily life .last summer , i went to a small town near the ocean with several friends .we was deeply moved by the beautiful scenery there , the beach is always full of sunshine .we loved to relax ourselves on the beach when the sun is setting sun , the breeze is blowing and seabirds are singing .we went to a seafood restaurant nearby , the seafood there can be the best in the world .but at this time , my friend felt quite uncomfortable .at first all of us did not know what was wrong , suddenly i reminded a medcine book i have read before .i happened to know that he seemed to be allergetic to this kind of seafood .so i went to the clinic and bought the right medcine for him .you see , sometimes these knowledge can be quite useful`` it is always benefical to open a book  as the old saying says , similarly , it is always benefical to gain knowledge , it can help us to know more about ourselves as well as this world .so that this plant will be a better place to live in .based the discussion above , knowledge which is a integrel part in our life should always be required by human beings no matter which kind of knowledge .
