in this world of never ending technology and demand for it , it is highly unlikely to predict the shift from the conventional means of transport to rather slow and unconventional means .before going twenty years deeper in to the future let us review the past five years .there has been an increase of about a drastic 150 % in the number of cars manufactured and the number sold in the market .this aptly explains the sate of mind of todays man kind .the increase in the number of automobiles would increase the pollution levels but man is not able to switch on to a less dustructive means .popullation is also a major draw back .this can be explained by the simple logic `` more the people , more the means of transport required  .as the number of vehicles increased by about 150 % in five years a decline in it is nearly impossible in this parasitic human world .though many of the educational institutions are not allowing vehicles in their campus the effect on the public is decimal .a person would always choose a faster way of transport rather than a slow means like a bi-cycle .it may also be possible that some day man made fuel with no pollution effects could be invented and the number of vehicles may increase as need is always the source for invention .but if such a marvel is not achieved then the world will have to face an inevitable natural catastrophy .hence according to the things standing as on today and the reasons stated it can be said that the number of automobiles would increase in the coming twenty years and man kind can not try to stop the increase but should and has to try to decrease the negative effects of the increase .
