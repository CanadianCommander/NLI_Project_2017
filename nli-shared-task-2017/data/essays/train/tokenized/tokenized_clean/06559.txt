different way thinkingschools and universities have different ways in teaching their student .we have thousands of schools all over the world , and they have different ways in teaching .we have a problem which is that their are two ways inorder for a student to study .either he understands ideas and concepts or he just learn facts as it .learning facts is the study in which a student just learns the facts as it is without knowing the origin of it .i think that this isnt a goodway .long ago we have theories done by scientists from different countries .every scientist does hie experiment and comes out with a hypothesis and considers it a theory .in our present life some people just learn these facts without understanding it .we have many problems and wrong issues that people come out with and we cant just trust it and move according to it .we should study the origin of these theories and try to prove it wrong .according to us fact is something that is found as it is and we should all work with it .on the otherhand , we have the way of understanding ideas which i think that it is much better than learning facts .a student should not just know this or that idea , he must understand it well in order to use it .for example in my native school which is said to be one of the best schools in lebanon , follows the first way of teaching which is understanding ideas .understanding ideas is a way that helps the persons brain to be more opened and refreshes his mind .according to my opinion , i think that we must understand ideas first in a good manner .we should not learn facts as they are but try to understand from where did this fact come from and study it well .
