cars are the symbol of the access to a better life for a lot of people because they have the felling to be free to go everywhere they want .however , car has no future s life in front of all the new technologies in communication ans interaction .that is why i am convienced that there will be fewers cars in twenty years .my first reason to belive this is that , in twenty years cars wil representate too many disagreements .for example , today , a lot of streets of big towns like new york or london are really overcrowded .the streets are becoming too little for all theses cars .for instance , it is more difficult to go outside paris , in the subburbs , than take the plane ans go very far from france .in twenty years , i think all big cities will be like london .actually in london , you can not enter in the city without pay a right for entrance .this solution express that people really want to reduce the numbers of cars into big cities .in addition , that is why every big cities develop the buses or the subway , which is really more confortable for people who have to across the town everyday to go to work .as far as i am concerned , i prefer take the subway because i do my travel in less time than if i need to take the car .in my opinion , this solution to develop in big cities subway or buses wil be developed as far there will have no more cars in cities .furthermore , i think that we must take into consideration the developement in twenty years of new technologies .first of all , we realize today , and more in twenty years , how the pollution is damagable for the environement .and cars are one of the main reasons to explain this pollution .that is why we really want to promote some way to travel which respect more our planet .in twenty years , i am convinced that we will have new way to travel , faster and with less pollution .for instance , in some little towns like bordeaux ( in the south of france ) , there is the tramway , which allow people to across the town without breath the carspollution .i think that is a really good experimentation .morevoer , in twenty years , we use more and more planes .indeed , planes are becoming less ans less expensive and i hope than in these time , all peopkle can afford it .that is why i argue that in few years , all people use traway or subway to across their city and use planes to across some countries .tu summaruze my point of vue , i am really convinced and i hope also that there will be fewer cars in use than today .in few years , we have a lot of new way to travel , without wasting all this time in our cars and , by the same way , we have the opportunity to save our earth .
