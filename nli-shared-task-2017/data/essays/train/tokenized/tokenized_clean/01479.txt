i disagree with the statement , `` in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today  .nowadays , almost all families in the developed countries have at least one car .they use it for various reasons , such as traveling , commuting , and they use it even if they are going to near places .car has been the most popular way for transportation .on the other hand , the developing countries are still struggling to get their ways of living more comfortable .they are trying to develop their techniques for industry .it is obvious that those people living in developing countries desiring to get their countries more developed .and when they managed to developed , what would they want to possess ?if i were the poor living in developing country , i am sure that i would desire to have a nice car , or may be a television .even if i got rich , and bought a television for my family , i would still desiring to have a car .on our earth , there are still many developing countries .the number of cars we can count know is still a tip of the iceberg .twenty years later , we would have more developed countries than now .if this really happens , the noumber of car would increase .how am i to forsee that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years ?however , there may be an development in car industry .that may result in a new type of car , but it is only that .even if car has developed , i think there would be no change in our expression .we would call our new type of car as usual ; car .there have been many developments in things around us , such as television , mobile phone , and computer .if we think about our early developments in those things , we would be able to imagine that there would be no change in how we call it .for example , computer has changed alot .first , it was only an big box that can calculate the number quickly .we had to have a big space to have one .although , look at our modern computer .our technology has enabled us to have own conputer for each of us .we could not have imagined it when we first saw the big box that can only calculate .now , we can even communicate with people all over the world .even if there are big difference between the first computer and the computer now , we call it in same way .for these reasons , i disagree with the opinion .
