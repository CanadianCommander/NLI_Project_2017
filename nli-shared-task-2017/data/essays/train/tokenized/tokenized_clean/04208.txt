i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older peaple do .of course , it really depends on the person , but i dare not to say the life is better when we are young than after aging .first of all , young people are still working on looking for their purpose in their lives .they sometimes struggle , confuse , and are treamendously sensitive ; it may be very hard time to live .however , by getting older , the memories of their adressence will be good .this means older peaple have richer experiences in the life than younger people have .second , generally young people do not have much money .older people may be confident about that they can afford something by themselves .after becoming adressence , continuing to depend on one s parents is going to be very painful .last and most important , older people know the quality of life .they are mature to live , and able to find joys in the life .comparing older people , young people may be soft and flexible .on the one hand , that is very worth , but on the other hand , it is not stable .the sense of values of the youth is still shaping to be mature .thus i think older people can enjoy their life as well as young people do although they lave already lost their youths .moreover , believing the life after getting older is nice , it is very important to make our lives happy .
