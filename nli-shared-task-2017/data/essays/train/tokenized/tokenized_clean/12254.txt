i m fully agreed that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specfic subject .this is will grow up the knowledge and it will increase the educational part in the personality of the people .for example , if you are invited in a converance that is talking about somthing that is not realted to your speciality .then , you will be unable to talk and discuss any point that might be mentioned or raised in the conversation .from my point of view , reading many books and articles that are not reated to one specific subject will help you to be more sophosticated person .another example , sometimes when you are specialized in one academic subject such as computer science and you read about other subject is not related to computer science such as math .you will see in some points there are some smiliraties .as a result of this , the knowelge will be widly increased in the two subjects not only in one specific subject .having a different career in the bacholer degree from the master will also increase the knowldge and it will be better to have the bacholar speciality with the same master speciality .finally , i encourge and motivate every person that should enlarge his knowlege and know many acadmic subjects rather that stik in one specific subject .
