i disagree with the statement that is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .when you travel with groups and guides there are only predetermined places you can go to , and also spend a precise amount of time in each activity .these are the main reasons why i prefer to travel on my own .i think that if you travel by yourself , you are not subject to a specific schedule , also you can organize yourself in a more convenient way .sometimes you feel like staying in the hotel and rest or do something totally different than the rest of the group .also it can happen that you do not get a great and cheerful group of people and that can contribute to some tension among travelers .several years ago , i went to brazil in a tour with several friends , and ofcourse , we thought that having a tour guide would be the best thing to do .initially was o.k. , but at the end became a nightmare because we wanted to do other things that were not part of the guided tour routine .for example , we wanted to go to buzios , a small town with amazing beaches and a lot of natural sites to visit .unfortunately , and because the tour guide refused to take us there , we were not able to visit buzios .some nights we also felt like going to different and more exiting places or stay longer at others , but , we were reminded of the policies in place .guided tours are very restrictive , and because of this and other experiences i have had in the past , i believe that traveling on your own is the best move .
