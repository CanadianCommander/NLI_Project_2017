i agree to the statement .there are considerable advantages and disadvantages to account the statement .only understanding ideas and concepts is something condemning , it sounds not true .but learning ideas and concepts along with facts will lead to more interest for students and make their interests amplified .as the technology is growing at a jet spead the point of learning concepts is increasing than facts .for example consider the programing technology used in computers for maintaing its huge databases and processing of it .we have number of technologies side by side for processing of data bases .student needs to learn improved technology faster than knowing its facts and hypothetical reasons .in order keep pace of the updations one needs to learn more faster and compete with the growing world .students are advised to learn or supposed to learn more concepts in little time to meet the course schedule and timings of examinations .so they have to pay more attention on concepts than facts .facts help us to remember the points and theories well .for example albert einstein inventions and laws , without knowing the facts of laws of newton and many other works of einstein we may not able to understand their inventions and formulas behind the derivation of those .considering the issues of relativity among the bodies einstein gave a nice statement and fact , that is -- `` a boy sitting beside a pretty girl for two hours  counts only for two minutes where as `` sitting on a stove for two minutes `` counts for two hours  a comical statement but a fact .then from that facts einstein brings the idea of `` relativety between bodies  .so there is a support to learn facts before going to learn concepts .without which the concept doesnt make sense at all .especially when considering the subjects like physics , maths etc .so learning ideas and concepts also facts are equally important to a student inorder to establish a control over the subject .
