in this period of time where there is a lot information to be processed , we need both people who have a broad knowledge in many academic fields and ones who are more specialized in specific subjects .we need a well balance between the two .the people who have a broad range of many academic fields are required because they can pinpoint problems more generically because of their wider perspectives .one example to this is in medical field .for instane , a generalist doctor has a wide range of information about human body but in small depths .however , for most of the time , they can solve the problems of their patients unless the problems are very specific .there is no need for a brain surgeon to examine the patient having problems with flue or just a headache .the people who have more specific knowledge about a topic is also required because by having a broad range of information with a small depth in many fields does not guarantee to solve every problem .a brain surgeon has a very specific and in-depth knowledge about brain and brain surgeries .revisiting the medical field example , a patient who is examined by a generalist and advised to see a specialist in brain would need a brain surgeon for further examinations .a generalist can not have specific and in-depth data in such a case .to sum up , we need both generalists and specialists .none of them should be overrated .
