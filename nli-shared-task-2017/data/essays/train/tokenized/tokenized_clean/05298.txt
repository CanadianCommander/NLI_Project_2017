with the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life becoming faster and faster .consequently , few people nowadays think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .on the other hand , there are still people think that the facts is more important for student to learn .in my point of view , i think to learn facts is more important than the others , which means i disagree with the topices and i will list my reasons as follows .first , the most benefit of learn facts .is that people are living in the world all fill with facts .both commonsens and our experience have informed us that the more facts we have learned , the stranger we are .for instance .a student who works in a compeny for a summer job .he usually get lost of solutions of many different problems from his work .nevertheless , under some circumstance , if the student just study a lots in college and learns how to understand the ideas and the consepts he will just solve problem as what he learn from the ideas and consept he got in college and some people may feel they are week .it should be potantially harfuml or at least unprodictable , in his carrea .sencondly , an arguement can be present my idea is that every people have to learn facts in theri lifes .it is obvious that people even can live without learn some ideas and consepts .a good example can give some lights to this point .the old man always tell his young the fact that he has learn , which means that the facts is more important for the young and for the student .however , to the contraries , nowadays we can see that lots of university student more difficult to get the jod than the college students just because colleges consider facts are importantfor students to learned .in conclusion , after the advantages and disadvantages weighed , and the biase opinion cast away , it is not difficult to say that it is more important for students to learn facts than understand ideas and consepts .
