for student , to understand ideas and concepts which represent the theory , and to learn fact which is the practice ; are both important .the practice is necessary in fields such as sciences .to make a theory , you have to practice first .a basic example will be the gravity discovery by newton : when an apple fell on his head .all experiences bring to a conclusion which is the theory .but before arriving to the theory , scientists have to define the problem , make hypothesis , practice , find a solution and draw an hypothesis .nowadays , in science class such as chemistry , physic , or biology , students have to follow the same pattern : problem , hypothesis , practice and solution which lead to the theory .thus the theory is the result of the practice .for education and everyday life , it is very important .it represents a base , a fundemental part to understand a topic .before doing an application , you have to know the application in the entire .the theory is very important because , it explains how something works .for example , you will not use a technological product without reading the instruction book .also , in mathematics with complicated formulae , the practice can be very hard , that is why it is easier to give directly the theory to students .but we could say that theory can be easier than the practce , because theory demand only to speak .on the contrary , practice is to get involve in a project and make things to achieve , which is much more difficult .i disagree with this statement , because , to my mind , for students , it is not more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .for them , both are important .to receive the best instruction , it is necessary to undersand ideas and learn facts as well , if not the education will not be complete .
