the world is developing day by day .new thoughts , new technologies are being applied to make developements .i disagree to the point that there will be fewer cars than there are today .firstly , we can see that different banks are emerging today in this competetive market .these banks provide loans at a very affodable rate of interest such that any one can think of buying a car .besides this , the car sellers are comming up with different types of intresting and profit making schemes such that everyone prefer to buy a car .schemes like providing insurance free of cost , free equipments along with the car and many more things which attracts people to buy the car .secondy , as i said earliar that competetion are increasing daily , so car manufacturs are making cars having so many facilities that people are tempted to buy it .facilities like a small refrigerator , racks for keeping books , mobile charger , music system and many things .we can take a example of a very busy person .if he gets so much facilities in his own car then he dont have to wait or go any where for water or dont have spend any time in charging his mobile as all these things can be done while he going somewhere .at the same time they manufacture cars that requires very less maintainence .then , now a days people are giving much attention to the health as pollution made by factories and other things are increasing day-by-day .so instead of buying a two wheeler they prefer to buy a car which is more safer and at the same time they can be free from pollution .so as the world is moving forward so fast people also want to cope up with everyone , regarding status , health , wealth and everything .so i think that the number of cars are surely going to increase twenty years from today .
