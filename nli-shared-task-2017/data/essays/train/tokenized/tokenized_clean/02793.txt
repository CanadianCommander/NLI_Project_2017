i think that it is more important for the students to learn the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the reason of ideas and the concepts are more important is that learning a certain subject will be much easier to be understand by students .students have different ways that they learn .some of them learn from facts , but most of them learn from ideas and the concepts .most of the time the facts can be difficult to understand .teacher can teach the students the basic ideas and the concepts in order to understand easily and quickly .for instance , the first few weeks in my government class my teacher taught by using facts , but most of the time , many facts were confusing to me .then , i asked my friend for help , but most of my frind that i asked were confused on many government systems .after , i talked to my teacher on where i was confused on and the way he taught us .i requested to him to change how he taught the class and he did the next day .my teacher use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts of the whole structure of government systems and laws .i learned many valueable and interesting informations that i did not know .also , my teacher made this subject easy to understand and more entertaining so that all of his student can focus and get interested into this subject .if my teacher did not use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts , i would not understand the whole structure of government systems and the government systems and laws .in conclusion , learn the ideas and the concepts is more important for the students than it is for them to learn facts .from my eperience , using ideas and the concepts can , not just facts , improve learning skills .class taught with using ideas and concepts can be more understandable .
