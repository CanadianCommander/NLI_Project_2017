in my opinion , in twenty years , it is more likely to find a larger number of cars on roads than we see today .cars which were a luxury a few decades back , have become more of a necessity today .as more and more job oppurtuniies are being made available to the people , standards of living are definitely on a rise .this is the case , specially in the developing nations , as the economies are growing .with more money , more number of people would be able to afford cars and thus , be using them .also , most of the families which are financially well off , have more than one car for the family .typically , each member of the family owns a car of his own , as soon as he or she can drive one .this trend seems to be catching up , lately .moreover , with the rise in population , we need more and more land to live on .this has resulted in reclaiming areas , which were not in use before .thus cities a becoming bigger and bigger , with their suburbs getting densly populated .as people prefer to stay in the suburbs , for reasons like , cheaper resourses , more area etc. , most of the major offices are still found in the main city .this requires , people to commute long distances .travelling by public transport is not an idea a lot of people consider , when they have a car at home .thus , the use of car is increasing further .with advanced technology , many car companies are coming with cheaper and more affordable models of cars .such cars , since they need lesser maintanance , have contributed to the increased number of cars that we see on the road today .atleast for the next decade or two , this seems to be a possible trend .also , traffic problems have been often associated with the increase in the number of cars on the road .to avoid this , many companies have also come up with two-seater models .these cars which are small , make manoevering in the crowded streets a little easier .in the years to come , we can definitely expect to see a lot more of these cars , flooding the streets .thus , in the next twenty years , the number of cars in use , are most likely be higher than what it is today .it is a bad news , considering the fuel shortage that is expected in the very near future and not to forget the pollution that so much traffic would eventually cause .we need to be prepared to handle it or the governement needs introduce laws to control its effects , before its too late .
