in business , it is said that `` change is the only constant  .through out history , examples abound where civilizations have fallen due to lack of change .this applies equally to people and organizations .without a periodic renewal in the way things are done , there is a tendancy to stagnate and in certain cases , deteriorate .i agree with the statement that successful people do take risks and venture out into new avenues , rather than doing repetitive tasks .i would add a supporting assumption that the successful people base their work on certain core and fundamental principles that can be applied across various domains .these principles include work ethics , moral values and judgements along with business and technical fundamentals .apple computer s ceo steve jobs is a prime example of a successful risk taker .instead of letting his upheaval from apple during the 1990s shatter him , he started a new company next , which was subsequently acquired back by apple .in parallel , he started pixar animations , which is a completely different stream from what he was used to doing .now , both pixar , with its animation movies , and apple , with its ipod , macintosh computers , are immensely successful companies with steve jobs at their helm .at the heart of his success lies the drive to do new things and doing the new tasks well instead of sticking with only doing one thing well .a similar example is that of lee iacoca with his time in chrysler and ford .the same statement applies to every professional .in order to grow within an organization , it is not sufficient to just do ones job .it is important to take that leap to the next level , which might be a big unknown , in order to show the capacity to grow to that next level and onward .
