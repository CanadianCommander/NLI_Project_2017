the usage of cars has been increasing since the beginning of 20th century , with the fordist era - the easy and mass production of cars in 1900s .however i believe that it has reached to its peek and in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because people are becoming more concerned with environmental issues , petroleum prices are constatly increasing while its supply is decreasing , which causes financial problems and car users started to find new solutions nowadays and public transportation is rapidly developing .fisrt of all , the global world is now aware of the environmental problems .for the sustainablity of mankind , the carbondioxide emmision must be dropped .billions of cars in traffic , all around the world are producing carbondioxide and destroying the ozon layer .fortunately , there are many organisations , public groups and volunteers that try to educate people on this issue and people are now feeling more responsible for the environment they are living in .i believe these efforts will result in positive outcomes in twenty years , and people will start to find new ways of transportation in order to save the world .caring about the environment is not the only reason why people are trying to find new ways of transportation .the constant increase in the petroleum prices due to the decrease in its supply , also leads car users to search for new solutions .employees of the same companies or students of the same schools started to share cars nowadays .by this way , they can share the costs of the car .in additon , there are some restrictions by some governments that supports this solution .for example in united states , people who pass across a bridge alone in his/her car pays more fee than the ones sharing their cars .in additon usage of bicycles , motorcycles and scooters also increased , and keeps increasing .the last reason why i think that car usage will decrease in the future is because of the developments in other transportation systems .public transportation is getting more efficient with the technological developments and it seems like it is going to improve even more in the future .for example in turkey , as economy improves , more subway lines are being constructed .now , most of my friends come to school by subway instead of busses or their provate cars .in addition to getting widespread in all around the city , the subway system is now much more comfortable and fast than before .societies  increasing awareness in environmental issues , increasing price of and decreasing supply of petroleum and the improvements in the public transportation sysems will result in fewer cars in usage in twenty years .
