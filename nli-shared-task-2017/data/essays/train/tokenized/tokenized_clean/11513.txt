i strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are three advantages for this : cost , time , and good places to visit .first , it is much cheaper to travel in a group than travel alone .in group travel , i can take discount .for instance , if i try to go to sydney , australia , the return ticket may cost me more than 200,000 yen .however , if i choose the travel agent s plan , it ll cost me around 100,000 yen .it is ridiculous to pay such a high price to travel alone .there are many fees for trip such as accommodation , meal , or entrance fee .if i join group tour , i can take discount all of them .therefore i can save a lot of money .second , i do nt have to worry about schedule .tour instructors always know about location , if some trouble happen , the tour instructor always cope with to adjust the plan .and they well know about history , so they simply and kindly explain us about the sightseeing spot .if there are some trouble during the trip alone , who can look after me ?third , i can travel a lot of good and nice places to visit .if i travel alone , it is much more difficult to arrange buses , trains , or planes than joining group tour .if i went for a trip by me alone , sometimes i might take pain to kill time , and sometimes i might about to miss the transportation .however , if i join a group tour , i do nt have to worry about it .i ll have more time during the trip , and that means i can visit more good sightseeing spot .in conclusion , i strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
