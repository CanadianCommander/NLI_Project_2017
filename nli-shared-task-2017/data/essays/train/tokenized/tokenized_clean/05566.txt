i think young people have the right to do whatever they want as soon as they are not hurting anyone or causing any problems .but they have to give somithing to the community they are living in .nowadays there are so many things keep young people busy such as games and computers .but that is not a good reason for them to avoid their assignment to their communities .most of young people nowadays are careless .they dont want to work or help in order to improve their community .on the other hand there are some great examples of young people who give help to their communities .i think it is not fair to judje young because of few examples .everyone has to controll his wants and try to help his community as much as he can .
