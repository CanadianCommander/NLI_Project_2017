for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts then to learn facts because those give a construct that helps them to survive in every situation while somebody who is only able to give back facts can not cope with real situations like in everyday life .first of all , facts are created by individuals and their opinion influenced indirect their researched facts .in other words , every researcher is caught in his subjectivity and facts are only as objectiv as the next researcher who will find another argument against it .learning facts is never learning the truth .researchers goal is it always to disclaim an argument or a fact .a learned | right | fact can be tomorrow | false | .but what should a student do if all his facts he learned over his studies are not worth it anymore to discuss after a couple of years ?his studies would not make sense without a construct that helps him to adapt as fast as possible new facts and to go with the progress of science in a sense .more important to a student are his tools which he knows how to use , how to get information .in addition to it he needs an logical construct of theses and ideas , that established during the history of science , to produce in comparission to all the theories that are already there his own idea and his own theory about a specific subject .so concepts are like an construct of a house skeleton made out of iron .the build a house with very wide open glass fronts you need first the skeleton and then afterwards you add the single elements like glass doors , glass walls . ..to make it a complete building .concepts and understanding ideas are the skeleton of science and compared to the house facts are only singular elements that can be exchange if wanted .for example if a glass wall is broken or not contemporary anymore it can be changed like false facts .but facts rely on the skeleton as well as understanding ideas and concepts , and can not exist without it , to create in this case a whole construct of science .while concepts and ideas function as skeleton and can exist without singular elements as a construct of science .
