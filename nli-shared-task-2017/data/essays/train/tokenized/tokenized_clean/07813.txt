taking risks and getting into the jobs you do nt have an idea about , makes people frighten all the time .we get affraid from loosing our money , our respect or sometimes loosing the people we love and care .i think we have to ask a question to ourselves here , do we really loose these things when we fail .this can be answered positively .like yes maybe we can loose money but on the other side if you dont try you loose the chance of learning if you could earn much more money .lets take bill gates and his supporters as an example .for such a thing which nobody belived in , they spended their energy , time and money and they took the risk .what did the risk of loosing money bring to them is the richness of the world .there is an other subject we d be afraid to loose when we fail to success in the new job we re trying , is our respect in others minds .in my point of view there is nothing to be concerned about this subject because while some people think you are a looser because you failed , some may admire you and the courage you have showed by risking your commodities .since you can not be the most regardable person in everyone s mind you do nt really have to pay attention for this subject .since we all have people whom we love , care and hold special in our hearts we of course may not desire to get close of loosing them .if we really ask ourselves the reason we keep these people special in our lifes , we will infere that these people are always behind us and supporting us even if we success or fail .they are always beside us to take our hand for helping us to stand up .as a result i can easily say that living in a routin manner life would be very boring and there is no reason for us to stay away from from risk because without taking any risks one can not learn to do what he do nt know to do ,
