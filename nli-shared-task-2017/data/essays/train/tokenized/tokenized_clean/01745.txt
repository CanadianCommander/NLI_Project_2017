i think that in our complex society is surely better to be specialized .i learned it from my own experience .at university i studied communication .when i applicated i thought i could really learn a lot about the specific mecanism of it .but i was quite disappointed .the main courses where quite confuse quite different one from the other .i have had a very spread education , because i studied a bit of history a bit of economy , a bit of sociology .but at the end i understood that there was nt anything that i really could say i knew .i could facing lots of different situation and solve different kinds of problems .and it could be very useful for every day situations or for a job without particular ambitions .but we live in a very competitive world and it s never enought to be prepared to the simplest .the process of development we live , we can appreciate it or less , require a great specialization .someone who knows very well is own specific sector will have more opportunity to devolop it , to find new solution and to have good opportunities .a person could also start from a not specific knowledge , that coul be the base for something else .i think that should be better starting at the college with a specialization , but even after it , there is always time to try to understand the little field where someone should be brilliant and follow it .a way to devolop this kind of specialisation could be with a master of science or with a phd .knowledge is more spread in our generation , and it s very good that more peple have the opportunity of a high level education .but the drawback is that to be specialized someone should study more than the others .and so he should go on with his own studies .but the most important think at this step is to choose a master that can really make the difference .it s better to study something so specific that just few people on the world know , than something that is common knowledge for everyone .
