in whatever lesson , we learn ideas , concepts and facts .ideas present the topic and facts are an application of these ideas .i think it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it s for them to learn facts .the way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand ideas and concepts and then , understand facts .it s not reversible .for example , in history class about world war one , you have to understand why this war took place and why all the countries were involved in this fight before learning facts : battles , events , great names , famous days . ..another example happens in mathematics class , you see that a theorem can be applied to particular cases but you should have understod before all the concepts which are used in the theorem .secondly , i think that , in a lesson , ideas and concepts are more significant than simple facts .indeed , facts are just applications of ideas .i mean that without ideas and concepts , you ca nt totaly understand a lesson .you can partially , of course , but it s not the same .i ca nt really explain it but you feel differently when you ve understood all .i feel kind of victorious when all is clear in my head .you ca nt get all the details explained if you ve just learnt facts because they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic .at last , what is the point of a lecture or a lesson if you just remember facts ?facts ca nt exist without ideas or concepts whereas ideas and concepts do nt have to be related to facts to exist .i know it sounds weird but some fields of knowledge such as metaphysics do nt really have any applications .however , they exist .besides , we always can extract an idea from a fact , whereas the opposite is nt as easy as we think .for all these reasons , i think that students should understand ideas and concepts before learning facts .
