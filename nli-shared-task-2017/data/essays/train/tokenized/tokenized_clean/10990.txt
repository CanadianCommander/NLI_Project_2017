i completely agree that young people enjoy more that the older people .there are many reasons why young people enjoy more .firstly young enjoy more because the have more energy .for example they can go to a disk and can spend long time in dancing whereas older people do not have enought energy to dance for such long durations , the can do the activity but for small duration .another reason why young can enjoy mre becuase thy have a good health and can enjoy variety of food like burger , pizza which older people can not afford as their health does not permit them to eat this kind of food .another reason young can enjoy more ecause they have more friends and of the same age .they can go for outing , long trips and also risky practices like rock climbing .long drives may include driving bikes on long journeys which and old person can not do .another point that supports my agreement is that young people have curiosity to know anything new and also doing thing which seem interesting to them .for example there is a prgram called fear factor .young people will try to participate in those programs and would like to do those stunts but old people ca not take such risk of doing stunts as it may hurt them more .one more point young people enjoy more because they want to experiment everything they see .this is not the case with old people as they might have done those experiments in they young age .for young people many things things may be mew but for older ones it may not .last point why young people enjoy more that older ones is that they ar surrounded by same age group people most of the time , so when their freinds do something intersting they also get a feeling to do tha same thing and sometimes it happens that their friends want them to be a part of such activities and they get involved in the enjoyment automatically .at the end it can be conclude from the essay that young people have many reasons to enjoy more than the older ones .
