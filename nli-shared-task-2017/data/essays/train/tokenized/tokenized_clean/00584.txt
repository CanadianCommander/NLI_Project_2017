nowadays there is a contoversial between using your own car or using public transports .this is a consequence of the environment destruction and the contamination of the earth causing by numerous actions that humans makes .today there are a lot of organaizations that are very concerned about the pollution and the damaged of the environment .they are trying to find a solution to diminishing this important problem .these organaizations tries to encouraged people to try to not contaminate a lot and to use healthy ways for not damaging the envionmet .one of the problem is using your own car our using a public transport .in my opinion i agree with the statement because i think that in a few years there wouldnt be as much cars as now because other confortable and faster ways of transport will be used , as for example the plane that its at this moment one of the best way of transport or another possibility is using cars that works with solar energy or with water contribuiting with the environmet .on the other hand the car is the most common way of travelling of most of the people .people uses their cars a lot becuase is the most cheapest transport and you can use it wherever you want .also the car is very comfortable .the problem of this is that people should try to be concerned about the advantages or disadvantages of using the car or another transport .as far as i m concerned numerous scientist are investigating new methods and ways of travelling .scientist have made predictions about the future saying that by a certain period of time there will be fewer cars and instead of using gasoline in the cars use another alternatives ways .as a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer cars because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not contaminating the environment .
