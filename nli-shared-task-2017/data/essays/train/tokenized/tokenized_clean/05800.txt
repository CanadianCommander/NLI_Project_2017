some people think students should learn the result of facts .even though that is importnat for stdents , i myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more neccessary for mordern life .people enable to manage their skills to their life easily .for example , when a person knows how to figure math concepts , the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programing field .if the person wants to be computer creater , the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business .learning facts is risky to interfer students  motivation .it is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong .students always think about their problems so that they can discover theirselves to solve the problmes .for example , in math class students always spend much time to consider to figure out the answer .people can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion .this process help sutdents to make motivation of studies .finally , learning only result is not always true .again , math class could be good example .many people notice text books often have some mistakes .when a student only learns the fact , a studnet might misunderstand everything .therefore , there are three reasons that i do not agree to learn only facts .understanding ideas and concepts help people to use their paticular subject to their life easily .also , this has posibily to improve students  motivation fo studies .finally , the facts sometimes mistake from the text .
