in being succesful many conditions are important .i will take as example the condition of being a good professor and researcher at the university .you have to be competent and self confident in your topic , so you can use the proper knowledge and the necessary skills you need in order to respond to a critic during a public assesment or evaluation , or reach an objective such us fulfill a research project or preparing lectures for the classes .this is often the reason why professors specialize in something : they choose a specific field , concentrate on particular aspects , start to study , work and reserach and they develop a deep competence in their specialized topic .so , the usually prectice and teach at the university what they know better .but sometimes , and this could be the condition of a relatively young reseacher , you might open to new fields that are related to your main topic of research but less known and explored .this evenually could lead in gaining a completely new and innovative perspective on the same topic , and make him really succeful in the academic faculty .so it s always important to take in account risks and explorations in of thinghs we do nt already know because this can provide a great opportunity for new findings , for instance in scientific research , where new inventions and innovations have often been the result of a combination of conscious thougth , accident and of an exploration full of risks .in taking risk anyway , it shoud be done with responsability and prudence : you have to be clear the objective , even if you do nt know the way to reach it , or in other words : even if the more convenient way is the direct one , since no sufficient and relevant findings have been derived from a previous research which followed this direction , you might change it with a more unusual one , at least sustable but maybe more effective .in the scientfic method scientist often use this strategy called transitory pattern , which means explore the similar and then try to transfer and verify the new knowledge in you field .so things for me work like that : to be succesfull you have to start with something you know very well , but only if you take some measured risks , you can make the difference which bing really you a step forward among the others .
