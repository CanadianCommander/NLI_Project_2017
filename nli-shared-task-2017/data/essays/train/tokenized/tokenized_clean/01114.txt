advertising ... bliss or cursehow many times did you a buy a product expecting it to be of high quality and usage , only to be disaapointed later as you discover its limited functionality and below average quality ?i am sure some may agree with me that this scenario occurs often , and soon leads to people arguing whether advertisments make products seem better than they really are .though i can relate with those who argue that it is the buyer s responsibility to verify the exact specifications and functionalities of an item before purchase , yet i belive that in our days most advertisments do `` beautify  products to seem better than they are .if we consider the hypothetical or rather normative purpose of an advertisement , it would be to show a potemtial customer the existing functionalies of a product and convincing him/her to purcahse that item .but with capitalism taking control of the world , definitions have started to change , and the business world has adapted to new masks keeping revenure - rather than business integrity-as the ultimate purpose .hence advertising became about doing and saying anything and everything to sell that item , regardless if that item is worth selling in the first place .if we take examples from the world , we can look at the historic and famous cigarette ads , which usually try to promote smokers as `` beautiful , adventerous , cool . ..etc  , yet not until recently , failing to inform smokers of the health risks , and high cancerous rates .another example would be plastic surgury ads that try to convince those who are running after the illusion of youth , that the usage of this creme or that mask , or those injections will actually turn back the cycle of time .again failing to tell patients that its all a matter of 5-7 years ( the maximum ) till any `` fake  effect disappears , leaing them with possible health hazrds .lets take insurance companies for another example .such companies tend to `` sell  their promises for safety and wellcare guarantees , yet failing in most of the cases to warn the clients from all those `` exceptions or situations  where `` they just dont cover !.even war has a been a commodity that advertisements has successfully over-rated and made it shine .the war on iraq was advertised as a legitimate procedure to fight terrorism , and liberating the iraqis . .and ...and . . !alot of innocent decent people fell for these `` shiny  words , but look at what really happended .the american economy has suffered greatly from it , half a million iraqis have been killed in 3 years , more terrorists have emerged !business should be eithical , sell what you have , or else dont !
