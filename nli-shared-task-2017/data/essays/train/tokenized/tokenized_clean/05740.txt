i disagree with the statement because i think that people can risk also when they are not sure in their experience .in my opinion it depense , principal , for thre personal behaviour of the person .if i was a brave man my instinct could involve me to risk , for example , in activities where i can have an elevated damage ( like economic business , private live ) .if i was an afraid man my instinct could be involve me to put a brake in my activities and in all of aspects of my life .personally i was an istinctive man and usually i take decision without think the negative aspects but only the positive .an important example in my life was the decision of live with my girlfriend .it was a decision that i took looking only the positive aspects . ..i took my baggages and luggages and i fly with her in an other country .after some days the situation changed . ..the risk that i had nt considered was very very high .maybe the logic solution can not be an other but in my mind i know how to doing .
