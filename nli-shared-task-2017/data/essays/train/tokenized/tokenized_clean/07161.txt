specialisation and having a broad knowledge of many different subjects are both equally important .both specialisation and general knowledge should co exist together for a society to evolvespecialists are the people who study deeply about a specific subject .they try to gain as much knowledge of the subject as possible .specialists are needed where the surface knowledge about the subject is not enough .for example if a patient is having a skin problem , initialy a general practioner will try to find a cure , but if the problem is too deep then a skin specialist comes into the picture .so a specialist is needed whenever a problem is too specific .but a specialist has a danger of getting isolated in his own work and miss the big picturehaving a broad knowledge helps a person to see the big picture .it helps a person to see the co relation between different things .the problem is viewed from every angle and also in corelation to other things .a generalist is needed to see in which direction the society is moving .he is needed to address the bigger problems of the society .thus both general knowledge and specialistion are needed and should complement each other for a society to function successfully
