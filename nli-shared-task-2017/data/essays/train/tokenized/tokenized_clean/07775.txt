a famous man once said , `` from experience , comes skill . ..yet experience comes from risk .this means that to obtain skill one needs experience , and to obtain experience one needs to take a risk .therefore to be successful one needs to learn how to take risks .when a child goes to school , they are taught the essentials that they are going to need in their life ; reading , writing , listening and leadership .when this child moves on to high school they are taught specifically what they need to learn to fullfill their ambitions .when a child graduates from school they use their previous knowledge to get a work place and a consistant job . ..then what ?the person has got this far , yet are they truly successful ?are they truly at their full potential ?the answer is no !one will never get raised or moved up in the corporate ladder if they are only doing what they are told .this is because everyone else is doing exactly what they are told too .to make ones self stand out they must be able to take risks and put yourself on the line .show the employer that you are willing to do anything for the cause and you will get moved .however if you stay put and dont take risks then you will not move anywhere and stay at the same level as everyone else that does nt take a risk .a prime example in history is that of galileo .he took a risk by defying the whole scientific system of his time and saying that the world was round and that the universe was heliocentric ( sun in the middle ) .of course he was laughed at and not taken seriously , yet now students write about him in formal essays such as this one .this man proved the whole world wrong simply by taking a risk .there is no man or woman in a history book that is there because they did the ordinary , they are all there because they took some sort of risk .to get far you will have to do things you already know , yet to be truly successful you will have to take risks .
