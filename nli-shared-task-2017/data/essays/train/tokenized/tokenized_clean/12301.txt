traveling is a major booming industry in modern society .a myriad number of people travel abroad even though they have to spend a lot of money .there is a ongoing debate whether people need tour guides when people travel exotic places .a substancial number of people prefer traveling with tour guides to traveling by themselves .however contrary to this opinion , i strongly believe that traveling with out a tour guide is better because of more exciting experiences and saving budgets .first of all , people who visit new places will experience more amazing experience .people will venture enexpected situations that they have never suspected .the rationale benind this is that if people follow the tour guide who know all the schedules and places , people wil lose their interests and curiosities .by exploring new places without any experienced knowledge people will feel the freedoms and excitements .when i when to sydney without a tour guide , i could understand that city by exploring myself step-by-step .therefore visiting without a tour guide is enjoyable .on top of that , people who do not travel in a group led by a tour guide save a lot of money .tour guide job is high-paying job .so tourists should be responsible for hiring them .one of my friend went to japan for two times , she said that she could save more than 1000 dollars when she went to japan independently even though she stayed longer .in this sense , traveling without a tour guide is more recommendable for the people who try to save money .in conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide .people can experience more staggering experience and can save funds .traveling is really appeling but needs much money .all in all , people can obtain beneficial profits by traveling themselves .without a tour guide s help .
