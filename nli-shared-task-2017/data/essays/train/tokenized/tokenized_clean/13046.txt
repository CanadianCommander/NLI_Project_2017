i agree with this statement .in fact , i m sure that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .everyone knows about the catastrophic consequences deriving from pollution .for example , our planet is becoming warmer and warmer and the sea level increased rapidly in the last few years .i think that pollution is a great problem , but i believe that we can do something in order to save the earth .what can we do ?we can prefer public transport , such as buses or metros , to cars .for instance , every day i go to university on foot .it s a good attitude , because i can have some phisical movement , i can meet friends on my way , i can stop for a while to buy a newspaper and , most of all , i can enjoy my city .i relax when i go out for a walk and i suggest that you try to do the same thing .so , i suggest that you prefer ecological means of transport in order to respect our planet and to defend it from pollution .public transport is less expensive than cars , so that you can spend that money in other ways .moreover , through buses you can socialize , you can share the travel with others or , if you are lucky , you can meet interesting people on your path .for example , last week , while i was coming back home , i met giovanni sartori , an italian writer .i was very surprised !i asked him some question about his latest work , called `` la mala costituzione  .he told me that he prefers taking the bus because it helps him to feel close to common people .i agree with this idea , because i think that through public transport you can share , not only a travel , but also feelings and emotions .in conclusion , i suggest that you abandon you cars and you start taking buses for three simple reasons : first of all , you can contribute to save the planet from pollution ; secondly , buses are cheaper than cars ; finally doing so , you can enjoy the atmosphere of your city .
