chancing opon this issue reminds me of a literary character that we are all probably familiar with ; private quelch , in the short story ` the man who knew too much  .a characterer that epitomizes the issue at hand for private quelch was an over-knowledgeable army serviceman who found himself in dire situations because of his blatant exhibition of that knowledge .the story potrayed to us what becomes of a man wih too much knowledge but hardly any concept of how to use it .quelch found that he always dragged himself too deep into unpleasant situations , pompously armed with just his knowledge .it is of no doubt then that i completely agree with the idea that it is vital for us to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely mug facts .being in the third year of engineering , i have millions of firm reasons to believe that plain bookish knowledge can only get us so far .after that it is the clarity that we have in our concepts and our developed understanding that help us proceed .and when it comes to students , boy , they sure need to have thier fundamentals clear and precise !a student who just mugs up books , and merely ` vomits out  all the stored information onto his papers , might do well in a few cases , but when it comes to higher learning , the student will need to adapt to understanding or his knowledge is simply wasted .questions of application can never be answered by such a student .learning facts is probably what would be beneficial to students in a general knowledge quiz , but it is defintely not something that should be completely overlooked .after all , what good are concepts when one simply can not remember the facts they were made to explain ?can a student ace his exams by just keeping his concepts crystal clear ?will he not need some facts hidden in the recesses of his brains o refer in different circumstances ?facts like formulae , values , constants and exceptions .he will most certainly need those facts to help with his everyday studies .nowadays , even the internet provides students with an unlimited resource of information .it is upto the students then , to properly sift through all that immeasurable amount of knowledge , and extract concepts and maerials that is actually practical for him or her to know .so what a student should not do , is to mechanically rote subjects .he ll never reach too far if he does only that .he should have an appropriate combination of facts and fundamentals , with ideas and fundamentals taking much higher priority .trivial facts can mostly be referred from ready-reckoners while others may need to be stored in our brains .hence , the adage ` knowledge is power  is hardly true .wisdom of how to apply that knowledge correctly , is probably what power mostly comprises of .we might all end up like private quelch otherwise !
