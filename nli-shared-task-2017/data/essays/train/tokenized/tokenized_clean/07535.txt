students go to the university to learn things which will make them more efficient in their job .but is it more important for them to understand concepts than to learn facts ?understand a concept and/or an idea is very important in some subjects .for example in chemistry understanding how a special reaction occurs can help researchers go further in research by inventing new molecules , find new or develop former reactions ( which were known to take place , but not knowing how it takes place ) .understanding an idea or a concept can make the student more efficient in his studies , researches , and in his future job .knowing how something occurs helps a lot in going further quicker .learning facts is also very usefull .i take the same example of chemistry .some reactions are known but you ca nt explain how it works , so you have to learn it to go on .learning facts make you also more effecient , you do nt have to look every where for the answer to the problem asked .if you want to use a known method to do each or each reaction , if you have learnt it before , you do nt have to look in the litterature everytime to do your reaction .i think that both are very important for the students .you need informations that are given to you by the lecturers and you have to learn and understand them .sometimes learning something can help you understand a point which was dark for you .learning things can make you also be brighter than you are already .sometimes you do nt have to understand something .learning things which can be useless to the students can be revealed later to be very important .learning gives you general culture .in a sense i agree that for students it is more important to understand than to learn because once you have understood an idea you do nt have to learn it , and it make the students save some of time .but your also have to learn .in conclusion i would say that both learning and understanding are the keys which open the gates of the knowledge and of conciousness .
