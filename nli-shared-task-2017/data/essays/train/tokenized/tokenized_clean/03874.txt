some people said that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays .i agree with it first of all , the most important reson is that heavy burden of their studying .especially in some asian countries , young people should take part in a large number of exercise classes and a great number of tests , so they spend a lot of time on their books .some of them think it wasts time to take part in communities .if they spend more time on their communties , they will lack of time to prepare their tests .futhermore , if they could not study in famous universities , they would not have a bright futhure even if they take part in some communities .second , young people have various kinds of things need to do .for instance , it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope to independence .many young people choose to do part-time job to earn more money and buy anything what they want .they may feel tired to take part in communities .of course , some students hope to get more work experience and social experience on their free time .they think it is more useful than in communities .after they graduate , they are confidence in their interview because they have work experience in some companies .third , young people have many different kinds of entertainments , .such as internet , television .some young people are reported to stay in front of computer all day and play games .they belives the computers bring more fun for their life .some young people just like to go shopping .as a result , they are all lack of interests of taking part in communites , in conclusion , i think there many reasons lead this result .it is a negative phenomenon , so i suggest the society , their parents and teachers should pay more attention on resolving this problem .
