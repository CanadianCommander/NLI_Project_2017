it is a much debatted topic in psychology , in companies or among friends what actually makes a successful person successful .are there certain characteristic that all successfull people have in common ?characteristics that are essential ?do we for example need to be risktakers in order to be successful ?sometimes it is stated that successful people are not satisfied with things they arelady know how to do well .they do not rest on their achievments but rather go out , explore , take risks and are willing to do and try out something new .i would say that there are a lot of different ways to be successful .it is not only depending on the definition of success ( is not the same for everybody ) , but also on the area or subject in which you are working or lets say be successful .for example someone that has a certain speciality can be successful in a certain profession without that above stated charactersitic .a model for instance just looks very well and s/he can be very successful in her subject without ever going new ways or taking risks .s/he just has to stick on what s/he already knows .in other areas i would say it is definitively essentail to be a risktaker .for example when you are working in a research department it is essential that you have good and new ideas .that characteristic is necessary to be able to perform this job well because if you are always just thinking about what you already know there would never be any progress .another example is when you want to open up an own business .you are definitley going a new , unexplored way by doing this because you can not predict for sure how things will develope .in my opinion it is not essential to try new things or take risks in order to be succesful .i would rather use this statement the other way around : when you are risktaker and you like to explore new things you are more likely to be successful than a person that always sticks to the things s/he already knows .
