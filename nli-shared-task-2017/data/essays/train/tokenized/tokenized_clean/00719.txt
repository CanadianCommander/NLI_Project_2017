i storongly agree with the following idea that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are reasons that i agree .first of all , what is the definition of learning ?in general , what do students comes mind when they think about meaning of learining ?i think each students have different idea .some of them think learning is same as studying .also , others think that it is just reading text books , or attnding classes , but what are they gaining from learning ?of cource some of them might answer that learning is given better understanding of the materials .however , if students do nt concentrate during the reading or in the classes , they might learn , but they do nt understand the ideas and concepts that they suppose to cover .therefore , understanding idea and concept is not always gained from learning .next , understanding idea and concepts are remained stude nt memory longer than just learning .sometimes , even students learn the material at the moment .if they did nt understand , it is very easy to forget and hard time to understand again .because one of the reasons people forget materias is that students did nt understand concept of the material even they learned before .they thought they understand ideas and concepts cleary but it was misunderstand .therefore , as time goes by , it might hard for them to remind the material and remember again .on the other hand , once you understand the concept and ideas , it takes longer to remember and sometimes they never forget .even they forget it , because they understand it before , it more easier to come up their mind .therefore , learning is not always helping students understand .some of the people even learn hard , but they do nt understand materials .also , even students did nt learn , they understand concept and ideas of materials .understanding material is more important form them .
