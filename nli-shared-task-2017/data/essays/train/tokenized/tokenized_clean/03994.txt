i think the human beings  life is bound to the risk factor .it has always been so since the primitives were chasing animals with bare hands .at the time the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful person was to live or die .our society inheritated the risk factor from our ancestor .in the actual society , made of people doing the same task everyday , taking risk is the key to success in the evryday s life .i think that taking risks and try new things is very important for everybody , not only for people who want to succeed .i can not imagine that we would have reached our actual wellness society if somebody had nt taken any risk .for example if the wright brothers had nt tried to make their aeroplane fly , we would still be travelling land and sea but not in the sky ; by contrast many people died because of flights .maybe if the wrights did nt try we would have saved many lives , but we would nt be able to travel around the world so quickly .one more example would be the longest jump made by a famous dirt bike rider .riding his motorbike he jumped 60 meters long and estabilished a new world record .if he hesitated before jumping he would nt have taken any risk but he would be just a regular rider , not the world record holder .by the same token he could have unfortunately died , but it s the price sometimes people have to pay to succeed .i think we should manage the risk in the everyday life , but it depends on situatons and mainly on the limit .the difference between taking a risk considered fool and succeeding is so slight , but i think it s exactly what make us different from each other .we can manage the risk and reach higher levels in the university , careers and society .of course the everyday work helps us improve ourselves , but in the end it s up to us to take a risk and try new things or not .
