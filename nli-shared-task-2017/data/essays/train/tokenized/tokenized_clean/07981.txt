if growing older involves the aging of the mind along with the body , in that case , i would agree to the statement that ` young people enjopy life more than older people do .whether you enjoy life more at 60 than at 16 depends mostly on your state of mind .but yes , i would agree that with age on your side you have the certain advantages to live a more fun life than you probably would ever do , as you grow older .as we age and our responsibilties in life start to increase under the ever growing pressure of work and family life , we tend to forget to stop by to enjoy and appreciate the little but invalauble moments of pleasures in life that are not easy to come by .as children with just school tests and peer pressure are our greatest worries , our naturally preserved innocence allows us to have more fun out of littler moments .a new pup in the house seemed like the most fun thing to have ever happened to us while we were not that grown up .with the brain not sucked dry by the pressures of meeting deadlines at work , the children have the enthusiam , energy and zeal to live every moment as their last one , living every moment of life to the fullest .also , the younger generation has always had advantages over the older ones , in terms of the number of options to choose from specially , when it comes to choosing from different ways to have fun .i can often hear my father recounting stories of his growing up days , when there were not many to have fun , it had to be the books or the playground unlike our generation that could nt decide between the hundreds of videogames available to choose from and along with the option to read or be out in the playground .with every generation the list of options to choose from keeps growing making the present the best time to be young at .but , like they say - aging is all in the mind , you could be 40 living the life of a 14-year-old and having the best time of your life , just because you choose to !
