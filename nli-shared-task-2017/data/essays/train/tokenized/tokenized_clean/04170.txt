in older times , there were complete civilizations that will see older age as the crown of life , the time when the spirit is free from the earthly passions and the brain is finally let alone to think , as opposed as younger ages when uncertanty and emotions dictates people s behaivor .in old greece only old men would have an opinion in politics and laws .in china and in some muslim countries only the elder can solve day to day problems and their opinion would be respected even when opposed to common sense .something happened to our culture that inverted the place of old people in our society , placing the young and brave on top while older people is seen as dumb and slow , to the point to pretend that they do nt enjoy life .there are a lot of activities that can be enjoy only when people is young , like snowbording and playing most sports .other things require a very young age ( at least to start ) like ballet dance and gimnastics , but the fact that older can not enjoy this activities does nt mean that they can not enjoy other activities , like traveling , reading , talking to friends , playing chess ( and i can tell my grandmother is a great chess player ) or visiting the family .there are still few sports that they can play regardless of their age like golf .therefore i disgree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because i think that there are many ways to enjoy life and it may not require the adrenaline rush obtained by extreme sports nor the ability to dance in the disco all night .life enjoyment can come from simple tings like smelling flowers , folding papers , painting , chatting and visiting old friends and far away countries .i hope that when i grow old , i will still have the hability to love my wife and enjoy life with the many activities that i will be able to do , but i also understand that for other activities i have a limited amount of time and i hope to enjoy them as long as i can , because the day will come when i will need to stop if i dont want to get injured , and i will need to find new ways to enjoy life
