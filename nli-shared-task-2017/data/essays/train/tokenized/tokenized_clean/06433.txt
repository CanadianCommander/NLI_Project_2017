from my point of view it is right , that people nowadays do not give enoguth time to helping their communites .i have the impression that the world we live in is a world of individuals .everyone just seems to live next to each other but not actually together .in the past people , were forced to do certain things together and help each other .nowadays the technolocial change has made many thing easier and less harder .thus we have become lazier and concerning many things we do not have to rely on each other any more .that s the reason why we became more selfish and lazy .many people choose to spend their time in front of the tv instead of helping their communities .as an example the amount of young men who do civil service decreased over all .most men neither go to the army , no do civil service : they just do not do anything .but without civil service our whole social system would not function any more .it is extremly important , that the young people take care of the old people and help them with their basic needs .in the end it comes down to a discussion of values .i am convinced , that there has been a moral change .nowadays for many people it seems to be most important to look after their owns , to focus on their live , sucess and wealth .regarding this helping others in the community does not seem to be relevant any more .everyone is responsible for his own life and luck .moreover it might be a problem that people do not indentify and related enoguth with their community any more .this lack of identification hampers them to play an active role in the community .due to immigration people with different cultural roods and with different kinds of religion live together in one community but do not feel connected to each other .in addition the problemes we have to face as a community todaz have become more complex in the process of globalisation .they are no longer as limited as the might have been in previous days .but especially regarding this , i come to the conclusion that even more help in the community is need
