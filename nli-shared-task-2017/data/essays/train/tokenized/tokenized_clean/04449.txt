i strongly agree with this statement .it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to just know certain facts by heart .first of all , i think that it is more challenging to come to understand a certain idea or concept , e.g. a philosophical problem .one first of all has to understand the problem and why it occurs .based on this , one can then try to follow the philosopher s effort and argumentation how to solve this problem ( or why it can not be solved ) .this coming to understand a certain logical stream of thoughts is a process of learning in itself and stands in contrast to `` simply  memorizing facts , like the name of the problem and the name of the philosopher .i put the word `` simply  in quotation marks since i do not want to dimiss the knowing of facts completely .i just think that a knowledge of facts should accompany the understanding of a concept ; only facts do not suffice .having fully understood an idea also helps when it comes to explaining things to other people , such as friends , classmates , or , in case one wants to become a teacher , students .when one has fully understood an idea , it is easier to explain the respective concept to others .only relating mere facts would not help others to throughly understand an idea .furthermore , a fact , like a date or a year , can , when in doubt , always be looked up in an encyclopedia .this does not hold for concepts .furthermore , concepts and ideas can , and often need , to be criticized and/or challenged .to be able to question a concept , one has to know and have understood what one is criticizing , to also justify one s critique .facts can , of course , not be challenged .in general it can be said that facts are not unimportant , but the knowledge and understanding of a concept or an idea is definitely more vital in regard to the process of learning and the usage and applying of knowledge in everyday life .
