from my point of view , in general i can only agree with this statement .nevertheless i think this statement requests for further analysis in detail to come to a final opinion on that topic .it is a clear and from my pespective very sad trend that young people nowadays do not invest much of their spare time into helping their communities .therefore it is important to evaluate the reasons for this trend first .being 21 years old myself and therefore belonging to the group of `` young people  i think i can base my evaluation on my own experiences .one of the main problems communities have to face is to make `` helping the community  attractive for young people , especially taking the diversity of other possible activities young people are offered today into consideration .most young people rather invest their time into entertainment than in helping their communities neglecting the fact that helping their community can become entertainment , too .i experienced a good example of this myself .since i starting thinking i know about a little festival in our suburb of the city of cologne .everybody knew about the existance of this little festival , but somehow nobody was interested in the organization or marketing of the festival .no wonder such conditions led to dramatically decreasing numbers of visitors throughout the years , which made the festival itself of no interest at all for the young population in our suburb because it always had the prestige of being `` boring  .but one day our school principal started a school-wide project called `` organize a social party  .initiated by a good friend , some friends of mine and me started to think about an event we could use to organize .then it came to our minds , that it would not be neccessary to invent a new social event at all .all we had to do was to do a better organization and better marketing campaign for the existing suburb festival .soon we started brainstorming for ideas that could make this community festival more interesting and attractive for young people .quickly a whole bunch of ideas was collected , so for example , a soccer competion called `` little world cup  where little teams of young players represented a country of the world fighting for the world championship .soon everyone in school was talking about this competition and the community festival , too .the result was an all-time record of festival visitors that year .this little personal example shows up how `` helping their community  can become entertainment and therefore become much more attractive for young people .all that it necessary is to show up the attractiveness of improving their community .if this can be aim can be achieved i think much more young people will start thinking about becoming active in their community .and this , even this may not be the way out of the dilemma at all , it is a important first step to deal with this trend among the young generation .
