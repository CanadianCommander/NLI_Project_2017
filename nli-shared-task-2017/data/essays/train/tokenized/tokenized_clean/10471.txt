young people nowday do not give enough time to helping their communities .in my opinion , i certainly do not agree with this question .nowdays , many young people would like to spends time with their own will .however , it does not mean they do not give enough time to helping their communities , just their own will comes first and it is more important than helping their communities to young people .however , there are many kinds of communities such as their interests , friends , even theri families would be count as one of the communities .although , families are one of their communities , i still believe that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their `` communities  .the reason why i think young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , even though it is their family , is the time they live .nowdays , young people are able to have fun with many things such as playing video games , having a party , and going to an amusement park .young people can do anything they want to do without communities .however , if they spend time to helping their communities , they still have some time to have fun the way they want to , but it is not what they want .they want to have their own time , not with the communities .
