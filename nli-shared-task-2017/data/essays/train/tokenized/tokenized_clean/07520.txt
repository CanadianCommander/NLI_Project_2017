cars are the major means of transportation in most of the developed countries of the world .this is the result of the advancement in the technology and the efficiency of the cars .in the developing countries trains , busses are the primary means of transport within the country .with the increase in the population the number of cars on the roads has increased .this has caused a lot of trafic issues .the rising gas prices has also added to the existing car population on the roads .the number of accidents on roads has increased enormously out of proportions .nowadays there are potential life threatening situations travelling by car than any other means .more people are delayed to work because of the increasing trafic even on the highways .some are unfortunate enough to miss even their interviews .so most people think that there will be fewer cars in use than ther e is today .i personally think that it is true .though there are plenty of reasons to say no to cars , it has its own advantages .we do nt have to wait in long hours after missing a bus , train or a plane either .the car journey is more comfortable .we can take breaks in the rest areas and relax ourselves during a journey .sometimes we even donot feel the journey s tiredness .its also less expensive .we will be able to manage our kids more easily in cars than on busses .with the help of modern technology we can make them watch their favourite cartoons or movies during a car travel .when i consider the advantages of cars i get confused about my opinion .i think that people are facing my present situation of using cars as their future means of transport .but with the rising gas prices and trafic congestion my opinion is to choose bus over cars .hence i conclude that there might be fewer cars than today after twenty years .
