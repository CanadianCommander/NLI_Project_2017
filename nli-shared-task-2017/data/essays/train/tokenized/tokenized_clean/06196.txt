i agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all students give importance to get high grades from the exams .on the exams students are generally questioned from the ideas and concepts which are thought at the classroom .in order to get high grades they are forced to understand ideas and concepts very well .the facts of the life are different than the classroom .in the classroom students do nt have the chance of practice .in other words they are faced with only theory .also they have an expectation that they will see the facts after graduating from the school .according to them there are two time periods : at the school and after the school .i think we must not escape from the facts during school period .
