i agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem better than they really are  .most companies advertise products produced using an old technology , cheaper in quality , and selling an old product with a new advertisement .first , most companies that market new products using an old technology make a very few changes , changes that are irrelevant to the final product , and advertise it as an all together new product .for example , in the past few years with the buzz around nanotechnology , a lot of companies have been advertising products which are supposed to be using nanotechnology .the truth is there are very few products that use nanotechnology in the product devlopement in the market .these companies are trying to cheat customers by using the buzz words , but not actually making an relevant changes in the technology used for making the products .second , a lot of companies spend huge amounts of money in designing fancy advertisments and producing products of cheaper quality .the money that they spend for these costly advertisements could be used for improving the quality of the product .so , the money is not being channelised in the right direction .these advertisers are big cheats by selling cheaper quality products with better advertisments .third , we must have seen a lot of toothbrush advertisments over years .these companies really donot make any changes in the functionality of the old product .all that they do is design a new fancy shape or name and sell it at a higher rate , including the advertisment costs in the price of the product .so , the customers are being cheated by seeing these advertisments and buying old products with no new functionality .finally , i believe there should be stringent set of rules that prevent companies advertising just to improve their market capitalization .there should be rules which state that no company can advertise a new product unless they have made a certain number of new changes in their products .if they plan to advertise an old product , they should put a statuary notice saying that this is an old product with a new advertisement .i would definetly agree that advertisers make products seem much better than they are .
