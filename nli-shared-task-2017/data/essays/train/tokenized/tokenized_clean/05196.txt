do you want to enjoy your life ?there is many ways of enjoying your life .what i think of enjoying a life is to be fun , and proud of what you are doing at all time .i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because what ever you do , the age does not matter , have more experiences , and they should understand the importance of enjoying their lifes .some people enjoy their life at all time , but the other does not enjoy it all the time .some even does not enjoy their life at all .to enjoy your life , what can you do ?for example , i would go shopping and hang out with my friends .i believe that is what most of young people would do .talk with friends , doing what you want to do .although does this have to be young people ?the answer is no .older people can also go shopping and hang out with their friends .there is no such things that young people can do and the older can not .older people have more experience to many things .therefore they can always challenge themselves to do something harder .this gives the guts to do and overcome what they had done before .they also can do the things that they had done long ago and feel like they are young again .as you get older , you begin to understand the importance of time more .as young people just willing what they want to do , and ignoreing what they does not want to do , old people prefer to do what they can do .young people tends to forget the thankness of being able to do things that they are doing right now .although as you get old , you learn the importance of being able to `` do  and be happy about it .older people enjoy their time so much more .feeling greatful of your life is not a easy thing to do .although there is no people that does not want to enjoy their life .it is important to understand that you should be thankful to what you are doing and spend your time that makes no regrets in the future .
