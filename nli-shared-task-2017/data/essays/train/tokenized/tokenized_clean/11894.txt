the future of the country lies on the shoulders of youth .it is the responsibility of the present generation to lead the country to the path of the prosperity .i disagree with the statement that youth do not spend enough time in community service .many successful community programs in the city where i live are associated with the active participation of youth .take the example of the cleanliness drive that was undertaken in my city to get rid of the rubbish accumulated on the beach .students and young working professionals showed up in large numbers and worked eagerly in the activity .not only that some people even went to the extent of putting up sign boards to educate the people about the hazards of polluting the beach .it can not be said that youth do not participate in the community programs due to lack of time .one of the reasons could be lack of proper advertising of program .last year the local program in my city to protect the turtles during the breeding recieved minimal response as hardly anyone knew about it , including me .however , this the local corporation officals gave widespread publicity about the program and a large number of people signed up for it ( it included me ) .the response was tremendous and there were actually more number of people than required .youth also need notset apart a specific period of time for community activites .they can incorporate them in their daily activities , like dropping the neighbours child at school on their way to college , bring the neighbours groceries while they do their own shopping or take out their garbage along with their own or in a number of other ways that can be done parallely along with their own activities .so , the notion that young people today donot allot enough time for community activities can be ruled out .
