nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they are more thing to do .i think that young people likely would help their communities but they have not the time for do it .an example i go at university everyday when to back go at home i study , eat , sleep and i have not the time to talk with my friends .i have not time to talk with my friend and i do nt help the people more near to me for this reason i can not help my communities .i think that many people like me have same problem because nowadays in the life there are more stress than in the past .i do nt think that one person do nt help her-his communities if he/she can do it .today we think only at to work because in this society is the best opportunity for to have much money and to have in this way a good life .in the past , pheraps , there is not the stress that there is nowadays .i know that this a incorrect behavior but i want to think about me before of to think to helping my communities .however when i can give enough to helping my communities i do nt have problem do it .infact in my life i helped many people also because i work without to earn money in the hospital however when i had more free time while now with the university i have not time .in my opinion this problem is only problem about the time , the fast to live and other problem of this type but no for choise .
