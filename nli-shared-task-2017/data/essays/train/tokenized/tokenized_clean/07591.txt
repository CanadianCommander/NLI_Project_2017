the term `` knowledge  as we see has a ample number of branches to be described .one such branch that we are about to see is that of a students academics .a man is simply a learner in his own life .lets consider the case of an individual when he is in childhood stage .as a child he learns to crawl , eat , play etc .in this context he is a learner to go through all the varied functionalities associated to him .later comes the stage of being a grown up boy .here would prefer to walk on the ground rather than crawling , thus his interest has got confined .in a similar way when we consider the case of a individual pursuing his academics .its would be better to excel in one specific subject rather than going through various subjects .this would be beneficial not only to the individual but also to the career that he opts for .consider the case of an engineer , if he is made to go through the subjects like , politics , medicine etc. then it would be infered that the chances of becoming an engineer are bleak .the same case may not be applicable to all other cases .when we take the above case of an sucessful engeineer we can clearly state in the maximum cases that , the inividual has had a plenty of overview of his interest and the subjects that he has studied .on the other hand a person with only confined knowledge would excel only in his choosed field rather than being aware of the happenings around him .lets take the case of any political leaders .as we know leaders are not born as leaders , they are the people coming from different fields .a leader may be a doctor , engineer , farmer etc .so the individual as a leader has to be aware of all the happenings going around him and also his region , province , country etc .thus here in this case we can say that a mere confined knowledge is not enough to be a perfect individual .so we can say that the method of having a broad knowlege of academic subjects depends upon how an individual approaches it , rather than making it a controversial methodology
