a lot of people think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i personally believe that peole whoo only do what what they alresdy know how to do well are more successful than those who belong to the other category .i have many reasons in support of this opinion of mine .first and foremost , i feel that by doing what one is already good at one has a good grip over the subject to be dealt with .this provides the person to think probe more deeply into his or her subject of specialization .thus success can be obtained quickly .for instance , a friend of mine who graduated in financial engineering tookup a job as an analyst which involves his branch of study .he tasted success within no time .his salary doubled within a short period of six months .in two years he grew to the position of a senior analyst .a nother friend of his tookup a job totally different from his subject of study and ended up earning not even close to half of my friend s salary .thus this kind of success comes faster and is more long lasting .the risk involved is literally nothing .it is any day a safer bet .aditionally , taking risks and doing new things may give nore scope for creativity .but , the amount of time and work it consumes is is too much .the results are not seen immediately .a person who follows this path requires to have oodles of patience .it is impossible to judge if the new thing will click or not .in most cases the risk factor is high and the person has no idea of what he is doing .based on the above discussion , i feel that successful people are those who do what they are already good at rather than those who try new things and take risks .
