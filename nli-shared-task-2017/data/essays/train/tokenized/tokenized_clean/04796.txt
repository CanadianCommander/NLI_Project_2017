i disagree with the statement that nowadays young people should not participated in community programs .becuse nowadays most of the people are educated and they are realized and planning in what way they can help to the people .recently tsunami occured in srilanka , at that time group of engineers from india went to that place and helping for their construction of shelters and arranged the necessary goods like food , clothing for them .because `` servicing to the people is servicing to the god  .moreover , many colleges are part time colleges .so , students have enough time to participate in nss ( national social services ) programs .since government encourage this program in our country in such a way that every one should participate in cultural programs .i have also participated in nss programs .when i was participted i was always `` cloud nine  .i gave suggestions to my friends and they are also participated in many activities .for other instance , most of the american people participated in rebuilding of afganisthan , most of them are young , do nt you think ? .in my opinion nowadays people motivate themselves , spend most of their past times for helping to the people .because of formar legislators and politicians has explained how people should respond in critical situations .finally i concluded that nowadays young people undersand the situations and are very well respond in relative situations .
