i agree specialize specialize in one subject is better .introduction :1. know the subject .2.opportunities are there .3.dont waste time .first reason is if a student to take learning on one subject it will be easy to get the score .for example if a student takes the course of like computer subject in this it can have different subjects are there .if the student to choose the subject java course .the student can concentrate on that subject .so he can get the good score .suppose if job is not get he can teach the subject to other students and he can get the salary .this is other way doing if he ca nt get the job .second reason is to create new project if the student take on one subject if we take above example java course .the student can create new things like if in the based on the java course he can create web sites and quick transactions .if a student going this way he can get better opportunities and the student get the better salary and he can bright future .if the student can create new project he can give the presentation on that things .if the government to produce in the market and people are used to that project .third reason is dont waste time the student can learn on that subject he can not the waste the time .some students takes different courses so that student can waste the time .those student no relief and happiness .because at the time of end course if the student can not get grip on those subject it will be very difficulty .if the student on one particular subject he can save the time .that time he can spend with friends or families or other activities .so iagree specialize in one subject is better .
