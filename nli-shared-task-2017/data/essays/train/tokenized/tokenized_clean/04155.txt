our world is filled with advertisements , they are on the walls , on the radio , on tv , on the internet , and even in artistic items such as movies or paintings .can we consider the adds as being tricky ?to what extent are they giving false information on a product and does it depend of the product or of the look that the consummer have on the product ?as far as i am comcerned i believe that addvertisements do nt lie as far as the consumer uses the product in good conditions .i am not working in the adventising world to have such a point of view , but for people who know a little about laws , it is clear that advertisments can not lie .there is a legal phrase `` lying advertisement  that would punish all advertisers who would give to their products false properties .and that is the main point about a product that is in add as it is in real life .but how can we explain that products that are said to be wonderful do nt plainly work when you buy it and use it at home ?it is not because the product is ineficient but because it is nt used in the same conditions as those in the test lab .let s take shampoo for instance , they are said to make smoothy and shining hair in adds .but when you do buy it , it does not make the same .why ?because at the first use you do nt benefit of the active elements yet , and because your hair are weakened by pollution , stress , etc . ..that make them suffer .the shampoo yet can make your hair as smooth and shining it is said in the advertisement .the less point would be that our consumer s eye is not the same as the designer one .he will find his product perfect and he wo nt stop talking about the new things it brings to us .this is the main difference that separates the inventor from the user .we wo nt have the same regard on a car as the one of the ingeener who made it or the designer who drawnd it .the advertiser shares this regard with them .
