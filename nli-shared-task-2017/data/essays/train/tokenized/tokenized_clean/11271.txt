my job brings me to different parts of the world all the time , and every day of my life i see young and old people enjoy their life in different ways .who enjoys better ?young or old people ?i would start saying that young people have an advantage over older people .they have more energy to spend and , apparently , they never get tired .this energy makes them to do a lot of things , for example staying up late at night , going to different parties all the time , sleep as less as possible , drink and have fun constantly .young people , though , do not have one direction to follow ; they move in all directions .i see them sometime rushing into things .for example , i used to have a friend that never had a moment to spend togheter with me because he had to go to so many parties that he did not have time for me anymore : that s something that i do not agree .having fun all the time seems to be the main topic for young people ; they do not have a clear goal in their minds for the future and sometime this can lead to a disaster .going to party , drinking and maybe smoking looks like a good deal at the beginning , but in the long term it can ruin your life .i had another friend that unfortunately died because he was having too much fun ; he was totally drunk after a party that , unfortunately , died in a car crash while driving home .from the other side we have old people that have different ways to have fun .let s start saying that old people , usually , have less energy than young people .they take life at a slower pace and that s why i believe they can enjoy better what they do .take , for example , an old couple in an island in the bahamas ; they can relax all day just watching the beach at the sea and that s all .a young couple , in the same situation , would wanted to do something : snorkeling , fishing , etc . .they enjoy the same situation but into 2 different ways .still both couple have fun .i consider myself still young but with some experience so , i start thinking to have fun like a young crazy teenager but , when i start , i slow myself down and really enjoy every moment in what i am doing .no matter if you are young or old , i think that having fun is part of our daily routine to enjoy our life in this world .
