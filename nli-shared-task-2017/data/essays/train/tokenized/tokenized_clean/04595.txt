i totally agree with the statement about the young people nowadays .the reason why i think so is because i actually see this phenomenom , young people are spending all the time on their own selfs and seldom cares about thier own communities .after school , most people would ask to play around out side , seldom of them might think of there own communities , like their communities have nothing to do with them , it s only a place where offers your commodation .but i m not like them other guys , i think that making our efforts to help our communities is so important .in my opinion , the atmosphere of the communiy you live will directly affects your minds , moods and behaviors .we all know that people could be affected by their surrounding evironments so easily .in one of my class , a teacher told us to concern about our own communities , do our best to help our communities to go better , and he would constantly asking us if we are doing the right thing !i feel this is so good for us to establish our conscience in our own place .everyone is responsible for their communities , because those are nt your private area , i think everyone should collaborate together to help thier communities , in order to make their ownselfs a better living .as the proverb goes `` all birds flock together .it reveals that if you are making efforts tohelp your own community , others will start to contact you and do it with you , this really helps a lot .in a nutshell , i think that we should start to educate our own offsprings to know how important it is to help our own communities , only a little people is not enough , we should promote it as a civic activity , live begins at our own communities , with more help , there is a better tomorrow .
