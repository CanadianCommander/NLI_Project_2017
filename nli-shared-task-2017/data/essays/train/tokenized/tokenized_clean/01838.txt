nowadays , competition among companies is increasing .companies use any means possible to make profits .advertisements are used to reach their targets and to sell their products regardless the qualities .i do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first , advertisements present only a picture of products .televisions are one of the main way used by companies to conduct advertisements .products seem very great when watching televisions .there is no way to touch the product .one can not have physical contact with this product .subsequently , it is hard to verify the product s quality .i recently ordered a cell just by calling the phone number i saw on television during advertisements .the cell phone seemed very good .it had many features .but , i did return this product because it was not working .it was quite different from what advertisements showed .second , advertisements are conducted to make money .companies pay a lot of money to get their products known by customers .televisions or media in general do not care about the qualities of products being advertized .it is therefore a contract between companies suppliers of products and televisions companies .the contract has to be fullfiled bu each party .customers  interests are not really a concern .companies expect to sell their products towards advertisements .most of time , these companies will refuse to replace a defective product .customers are therefore victims of false advertisements because of companies that are only motivated by making profits .making profits is common .because advertisements make productts much better , customers have to pay more attention .they have to make sure that producs are of great quality .products should therefore be sold with mandatory warranty period in order to prevent customers from false advertisements .this is very important today .
