i do not think it a good idea to take a group trip led by a tour guide .i have to admit that there are some advantages of this stye of travelling .there are no troublesome decision making , no worry about nasty troubles , and most importantly , it is cheap .actually , i used to make use of this when i was an university student .but now i realized that a group trip is simply boring and is not worth paying even little money .i will give two reason for my opinion .firstly , you can not fully enjoy your travel , unless you explore the town by your self .the good part of taking a trip lies in the point that you might come across strange and new things and people in a new environment .you can find out an unknow part of yourself and some new perspectives on life itself .if you take a group trip , however , you can not appreciate this point , since you are always bound up by the tight schedule .secondly , you could easily end up buying loads of unattractive goods at the extraordinary high price , if you join a group tour .as is well know , the reason why a group tour is cheap is that it has a strong connection with local shops .when i went to chine in a group tour , i was so annoyed by shop assistants desperately selling expensive goods with their fluent japanese .it definitely ruined the great part of my pleasure in the trip .for these reasons , i hate taking a group trip led by a busy and materialistic tour guide .even if i had the chance to visit a primitive island where there are nobody who can help me , i would not chose a guiding tour .
