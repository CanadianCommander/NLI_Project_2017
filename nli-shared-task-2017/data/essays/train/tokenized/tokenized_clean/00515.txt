i agree with the statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  , because if they want to be more successful than they already were , they would try to expand their skills and learn more new things and try to become successful in that , too .they would risk their time and money , and probably even their profession , in order to gain that knowledge and master that .once a person gets good at something , he or she either tries to get even better at that skill , or they keep it at a level they are content with .to successful people , that is not enough .i have a friend who is a wonderful harpist , and she practices her harp at least 9 hours a day .she is a harpist for 3 professional college orchestra/groups and plays in concerts practically every week .but even with all her talent , she always says it s not enough .now , she s learning how to play other insterments , like flute , clarinet , and cornet , and is expanding her musical skills to a new level .she is almost like a professional harpist , yet she pushes herself harder and harder by practicing for hours and learning how to play new musical insterments .in order to learn new things , people must get educated .in order to get educated , they either have to find a professional who majors in that particular field or go to a school/college .most successful people have jobs and probably even a fammily , so if they want to learn something new , they would have to cut their time short with either one of them , maybe even both .that causes new risks , like losing their job because they do nt work as much anymore , or lose their family because they do nt spend time with their family anymore and his or her husband/wife is tired of their ignorance .but if they think their education is worth the risk , then they should go right ahead and keep on going .you do nt have to be successful in order to learn new things .no one has the right to stop anybody from gaining knowledge for their satisfaction .
