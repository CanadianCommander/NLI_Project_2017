in accomplishing something that is risky comes the reward of success .with success comes satisfaction , envy , prosperity , and confidence .i believe that the human race would not be the same without the risks that some of our great inventors and leaders took .it even takes great courage and confidence to be a successful businessman .going where no man has gone separates the great from the norm .the best example of a risk taker that became successful is bill gates .not only is he the richest man in the world , he created something that almost everyone in the modern world uses , windows .had bill gates stayed with apple and graduated harvard , who knows what the screen on our desktops would look like ?instead , he did exactly the opposite , he took a chance .bill took a huge risk by going out on his own to create a program that was not well known at the time it was introduced .a few years later , windows became the standard in the computer industry .unfortunately , apple , bill s former employer , rejected his program when it was asked to get bought and suffered a huge loss in potential profits by `` doing what they already know how to do well .even the land of america would not have been discovered and colonized if risks were not taken .the american pilgrims took a risk in leaving everything behind and starting a new life in an unknown territory .then came the declaration of independence .this was a document that accused the forefathers of america with treason .had they not taken the chances of complete failure and war against the biggest military power at that time , america may not be the supreme power that it is now .even if one fails a thousand time before reaching their goal , the feeling of success is something nobody can take away from them .sticking to something that one already knows is not a bad thing , but it will never let a person shine or stick out from the rest - success .
