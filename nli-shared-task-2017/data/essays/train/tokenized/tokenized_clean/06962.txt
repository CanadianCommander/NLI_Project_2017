some people say that the group tour is the best way for safe and convinient tour .however , i diss agree this idea for two reasons .first , we do nt have free .second , group tour need more extra money .to begin with , how many people like to be controled ?of course , it will be very few people .however , when people travel with a tour guide they should be controled .people will have less time for their own free time because they are group so they have to follow the rule .it will be very annoing .let me take my experience for example .two years ago , i went to the tiland .at that time , i could not set my own sckejule because i did nt have much time before depart the tour .when i arrived air port , i was very angered because a tour guide guided more than 50 people .so she could nt care abot each individuals .also we have to conduct as sckedule which made by the guide .so , it was really bad experience .next , if we travel by onself , we can save money .many people expect that a group tour will be cheaper than nomal people s tour .however , the group tour usually need the mandatory shoping so it is definitaly not cheap even expensive .a few days ago , a tv program covered about the exaggerated group tour .these tours dcampained their item is the most cheapest .many people enrolled but when they arrive the place .they have to buy and buy and buy .if you tour alone , this will never arrise .you can spend your money economicaly .in this sense , group tour is not good idearin conclusion , i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group tour for the reasons that i mentioned above .
