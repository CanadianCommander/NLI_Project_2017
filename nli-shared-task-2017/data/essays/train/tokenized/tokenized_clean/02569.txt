first of all , i want to express that life is taking risks .people born with risk , they improve or change their and other s lives with risk .think that you are in an unknown forest that you do nt know anything about .you can stay and wait someone to come and escape you or you can start to move without knowing where you are going .maybe the first way is the secured one but also it is the closed one , it is closed to movement , finding , improvement or disappointment .some of you can think that it is not logical to choose the way that goes to disappointment but i do nt think so because every acknowledge is reached by suffering and disappointments .consider van gogh , edison , tresca and the others . ..how did they paint the incredible pictures or how did they create the complex physical formulas ?how did the people go to the moon ?they all took risks to improve . ..even we have born on this theory because falling in love is also a risk .if our mothers and fathers have not taken that risk , we would not be on the earth today . ..let s think on an other hand . ..while we are searching for something , in fact we learn very different things from we are trying to reach , different problems and views force us to think in different ways so we think more and more . ..we find ourselves in a different field and we produce more problems and solutions .it means we change and improve ,,,, yes , but what is the success ?is it to gain too much money or have everything ?absolutely no .it is to change , not to step on the same land . ..we have borned to this beautiful world , we should try to change our world better and better .for us , for others and for our children , we should courage to take risks . ..for all the beautiful and peaceful things . ..
