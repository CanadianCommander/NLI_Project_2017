i agree with this statement having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can give you a greater understanding and a wider view , this will open your mind to different ideas and help you with future careers .having knowledge for a wider range of topics exercises your ability to `` think outside the box  .for example , the american depression , the stock market crashed in wallstreet , to understand why this happened or why what caused the crash you must have some knowledge of business because the subject revolves around your understanding to businesses and hire purchase ect .as i mentioned earlier to have a successful career you must have a distinctive knowledge of the world around you , being a teacher for example , a teacher must have some refrences to other subjects to give their students a unique understanding or explanation for the student to understand what they are studying , then the students can link their subjects to each other and combine their knowledge to pick a specific career themselves .another way of looking at it would be that in the future there will be more options and again this will open doors for you it will give you easier access to many things , this will give you the chance to choose what you like and this will grant you a better happier life .an example would be is that if you do nt like a certain job , you can specialze in something else you can link it to .in conclusion having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than only specializing in one spectific subject is a good thing !having greater oppertunities and a wider range of things will inlighten you and get you interested , linking subjects to each other prevent confusion it will not mislead you , do not be mistake because greater knowledge is a greater life .
