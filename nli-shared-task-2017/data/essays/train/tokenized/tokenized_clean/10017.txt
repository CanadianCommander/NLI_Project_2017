as the saying goes `` every coin has two sides  , some people think that we should broad our knowledge of a variety of academic subjects , but other people believe that we should specialize just in one specific subject what we master in .in my opion , i agree with that we should master in few subjects what we want to learn instead of study a lot of subjects .there are several reasons why i agree with the idea .first , althought some people talked about that we should study a lot of subjects that could enhance our fundation knowledge , i think that if we do nt have any mastered subject , we ca nt distinct from others .and everyone should showes our differences from others .for example , if everyone just knows a little in every subjects what we study , we colud not ask others deeper question .in the long run , it could not advence in our society and our world .second , althought you do nt have a variety information of every subjects , we can reach the top in the subject what we master in .and if we have deeper information , we could get better job what we need .for example , although i m not good in english , i master in math and it could be the best way for me to teach math .another example , my friend , john , althought he know everything a little in our life , actually , he still get no job now .to sum up , this is more important to master in a subject than know a little in every subjects .there are a lot of adventage to master a subject what we want to choose .and this is why we have to select major subjects in universities .
