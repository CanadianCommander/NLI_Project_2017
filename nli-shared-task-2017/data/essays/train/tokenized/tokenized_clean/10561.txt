most people agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .through own experiences and and earned knowlegde , people learned to differ between reality and the promises of the `` commercial world  .but still a lot of people get miss lead by the appearence of products in advertisments .i think that small companies do nt really what their products to appear better than they are because they ca nt sell their products when they have promised something completely different .for example , the cleaning product does nt do what it s promoters promised .once you have bought this product you will never buy it again because it s wasted money to invest in it .eventually you will tell your friends and they wo nt buy it either .it s more efficient for the company of a smaller size to invent a product that is reliable and people will buy this particullar product more often .so the company is able to earn more money .in my oppinion the false appearence of products in advertisments is a result of a wrong , overpromotion and often used by big companies who sell more than one product .when big grocery stores produce commericals , their goal is to attract new costumers .people do nt go to grocery stores just to buy a single apple .once they are in the store they buy other things which increase the profit of the company .i think you ca nt really generalize that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it depends on the size of the company , their promoting abilities , the mony a companies has availible to spend on promotion and the target age group .little kids are more likely to believe what commercials are promising than most of the grown-ups who understand the concept of business .
