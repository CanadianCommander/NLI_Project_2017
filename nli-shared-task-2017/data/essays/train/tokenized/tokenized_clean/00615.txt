the knowledge is to know things about every things , but specializing is to know every things about one thing .i believe that all students should get as much as they can from academic subjects .however , they also must by specialize in one subject , because of the link between all that sudgects .according to that idae , if we want agert sintis we should teach him differnt kind of subjects that will help him in his wark , and those subject must be related to the euchother .on the other hand , we must not teach the student any thing , not related to his subject , so he will not loss his time .all students should learn how to teach thimsilf after they finish they academic years .so they will be able to get more knowledge in there free time .in conclsion , it is better to have droad knowledge of one or specialized academic subject than many subject .
