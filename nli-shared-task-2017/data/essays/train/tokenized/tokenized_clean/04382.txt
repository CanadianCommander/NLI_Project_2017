some people might disagree that it is more important that students understand ideas and concepts than it is that they learn facts because the facts are more concrete and easy to understand and distinguish each other .but personally , i think it important that the students learn something adjustable to each environment and flexible to the problems they will encounter .therefore , i agree that it is more important that they understand the ideas and concepts than learn facts .first , if students learn the idea and concepts from their experiences , they will be able to easily adjust themselves to the similar problems in the future .for example , my major was biology and i have done a lot of experiments related to the cancer bilogy .when i extracted the dna , there are many different kinds of methods .sometimes each laboratory uses a unique way to do so .but at the begining , i read the books and understood the ideas and the concepts beneath the protocols , i did not get confused when i changed the laboratory and encountered the different method of the dna extraction .second , if students learn the idea and concepts , they can modify problems and even produce the new discovery .fo example , when i read the vast amounts of research papers , some people reported the differnent results from the others and there were a lot of confusions .but once i leaned the concepts of the reaserch purposes and approches , i could summurized why they produced the different facts and realized that all of data were actually suporting the same consequences .even , this findings leaded me to a novel discovery .for these reasons described above , i think that it is pretty important that students learn the concepts and the ideas of their problems and experiences .these concepts and ideas would be very useful for them to resolve the problem and find the solution of the difficult enviroment in the future .
