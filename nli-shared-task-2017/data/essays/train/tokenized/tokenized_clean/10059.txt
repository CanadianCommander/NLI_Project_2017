sure , i think the successful people always take risk and try new things because they have high self - confidence , they believe on every idea that he or she is thinking and sacrify .while other kind of persons keeps doing the same thing all the time because they fell save .the successful person always see the world like a place to develop new projects , although maybe , these will not have the good result .but there , is playing a specially situation , the self-confidence .a success person not always have all the idea like a glass , because in this world there are a lot information .but , they take or use all the information first , to develop things .maybe they will take much time to have the answer but one day , they can have a excellent project .second , if person believe that her or his idea is good , this person will finish it .but one person that always play to keep save never have a new idea to follow .third , all these characteristics , after mentionate , are important but the sacrify is necesary , too .one persona who does not have sacried something never will reach a subject in her or his life .
