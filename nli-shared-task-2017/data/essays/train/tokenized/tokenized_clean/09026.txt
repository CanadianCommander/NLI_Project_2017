i disagree with this statement .this statement is nt true for all young people .in my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping .i have been being a scout leader for four years .i give my free time to care for children , to think about games which i can play with them and to help them if there is any problem .i dont get any money for this , i do this because i like it and have fun almost always .of course there are situations where i am nerved and tired of entertaining children , but all bad emotions vanishes if you could make these kids happy .so it depends on the education and the surrounding of a young peolpe wether he ( or she ) is willing to help his ( or her ) community .not all peolpe have this social ambition that i have .i can imagine there are people who only want e.g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc .they want to obtain their goal without careing for other peoples .but i think that there were always such people who dont care .when i read this statment , i wonder what enough means .who determindes what or how much help is enough ?i think there is nt a right answer .everyone should find out for theirselves what time to help they would like to spend .considering jobs which are paid there are other points .all men who dont want to go to the army have to do social work for one year .they have to care for disabled humans or very poor people .my brother has to do this at the moment and he does his job at the social meeting point of the main railway station .he tells me about the different kind of people and lives he was get to know .i think he is doing enough for the community and his work is nt easy .in my opinion people who have never done a piece of social work indepent from the kind of work missed some important , character-forming and great experiences .
