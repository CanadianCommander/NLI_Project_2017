in my opinion , what expressed in the statement is not completelly true .i think that the fact that for a student , ideas or concept are more important than to learn facts , depends on the different attitude the student has .in my opinion by the way , it s really more important to understand ideas and concepts behind a fact .the best example i can use to add value to my assumption , is my own experience during the university study .i ve studied engeneering and for most of the exams i did , to understand concepts was the most important aspect of the studying .without that it would have been very difficult to pass the exam .because you need that to approach to a brand new problem , that you have not seen before .i can study the fact that a construction can collapse if some project aspect are not respected and i can learn this facts .but if i do nt understand the concept or ideas behind structure s phisics i could hardly been able to project it properly .on the other hand it is obvious that for someone else results are more imoportant than the cause that has produced them , and therefor for those student , facts should definitely be more important than the ideas behind them .i m reffering for example to those students interested to history subject .those students are mainly interested in facts that are the basis of their study field .but even for them i think schould be important to know and to understand what was behind a specific period or event .to better rember what happened due to a logical cause-effect process .
