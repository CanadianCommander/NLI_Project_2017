do young people enjoy life more than older people ?or does age even affect the satisfaction of each individual ?these are two questions that will be discussed in the following essay .several arguments will be presented and evaluated .first of all , the assumption can be made that younger people , especially in germany are offered more opportunities than ealier generations could ever experience .the educational paths provide a large variety to develop oneself and to choose a career that suits one s interests .next to the formation of the academic curriculum , possibilities to create free-time activities are almost endless .should this freedom which is offered to the young people however , have an influence on how satisfied they are with their life ?older people in contradicition are more limited concerning the above mentioned aspect .many did not have the possibility to select their work as well as preferred lifestyle according to their major intersts , due to the second worldwar .this issue might lead to the fact that they regret that they were not offered such a large amount of opportunities .furthermore , health issues might lower the quality of life with increasing age .i believe that the question should not be if older or younger people enjoy their life more , but rather if age is one of the significant factors that has an influence on overall satisfaction .in my opinion , not age but rather the optimistic or pessimistic point of view each individual has , decides about his or her quality of life .this characteristic is absolutely independent of age .
