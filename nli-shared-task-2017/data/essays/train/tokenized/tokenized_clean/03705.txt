when one weigh the pros and cons of using a car , it will lead to an inevitable conclusion : in twenty years car will become a kind of ` endangered species  in our modern society .currently , this question is raising a huge controversy because , on the one hand , car is widely used as a traditional means of transportation and cars are also a part of our cultur [ especially , in the us , where car drivers are totally enamored with their cars ] .but on the other hand , the increasingly price of petroleum and fossil fuels , the environmental issues linked to the widespred use of cars and other drawbacks make people think more deeply about cars .as a matter of fact , i maintain that cars are going to disappear in a very close future , mainly because of economic reasons and environmental issue .first and foremost , people are more and more concerned about the sharp growth of their expenses .using a car involves a lot of shortcoming since it is very expensive to purchase a car , to buy oil and to ensure your car , for instance .so it seems that cars tend to become less available for the middle class families in developped countries .besides , one should bear in mind that it is not so comfortable to use a car because you have to endure traffic jams , which may end in traffic accidents sometimes , you have to commute every day and i strongly believe that people are fed up with such problems .moreover , cars will be fewer used in the next years because people are well aware that it is damaging to the environmemt and the nature around them .obviously , one should not expect modern human to renounce technological progress or to return to the stone age .but , if things are left as they are , the human specie will finaly disappear .thus , i am sure that one should prefere rescue our planet and lives of next generation rather than keeping his car .that is all the more crucial that the situation is obviously getting worse , so i can not help thinking that men are able to make sacrificies if it is worth it .similary , we can see the harmfull impact of cars in our daily life .in big cities there a lot of exhaust fumes , a lot of noise , smog and pollution and , to my mind citizens will not stand it any longer .finally , the developpement of alternative ways of transportation will also lead to a fewer use of cars .for instance , a mayor in a big town can decide to increse the public transportation network , to make it more convenient and available in order to replace cars .that is what happened in paris recently .to conclude , eventhough a lot of people are still addicted to their cars , they will soon change their mind .economic reasonning and ecological issue are couple of reasons which let us thinking that there will be fewer cars in use in your city .there is no doubt that it will enhance our quality life for both generations , present generation and future generation .
