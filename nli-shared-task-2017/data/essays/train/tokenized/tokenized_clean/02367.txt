i disagree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are many reasons to explain my opinion of disagreement that the most advertisemnet make products seem much better than the really one .one reason is users and the other reason is showing the products to people .as we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people .the first reason is users .as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies .most of the companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or user to buy the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year .for example , if i have a company , i will provide good products to the people , and i will advertise my products in good way as it is .the advertisement will show my products to more and more people .so , most advertisement make products seem the real one .other reason is that the advertisement is used to show the products as it is without adding anything that makes the production seem much better than they really are .in addition , the advertisement is good way for people to have good products in homes .fore example , the advertisement will show the advantage and disadvantage of the product .if it has disadvantage , the advertisement will show its disadvantage , because if the advertisement does not show the advantage and disadvantage , the company that makes the advertisement will lose its users and people .finally , i disagree that the most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .the above two reasons explains my opinion about advertisement .users are imprtants for the many companies and the advertisement is used to show the products to people .
