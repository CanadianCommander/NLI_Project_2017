the issue at hand is , whether there are more cars in use in twenty years than there are today or not .this issue is very important because of the global environmental pollution .i beliefe , that there will be much more cars in use in twenty years than there are today .there are several reasons why i state this meaning .at first , almost nobody who actually has a car will sell his or her car or reduce the numbers of cars or will change generally on the public traffic .even if the car is crashed , people normally make it repared or buy a new one .the reason for this behavour is verz simple : people are comfortable .using the car is the most comfortable way to move .furthermore , china and india ( emerging market countries ) are countries with a huge citizenship .actually , in these countries , there are not a lot of cars because most of the people living there have not enough money to purchase cars .these countries are emerging market countries , i.e. the economy in these countries will increase enormously .therefore , the people will get richer and in some years , a huge number of indian and chinese people will have the ability to purchase cars .even if a lot of europeans and americans change their behavour and get more sensible to the environmental problems arising out from the individual traffic and sell their cars or will not pruchase new ones , the number of cars will increase in the bext years .a third reason is the world economy .the production of cars is an important economy subject with al lot of employees .futhermore , also the gaz industry is important .these two industries together will show that the number of cars will not decrease beacause of their business interest .they will also take influence on the politics that they can sell their cars and their gay cheaply ( e.g. no high taxes on these products ) .as argued , i believe , that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than today .but i am also sure , that the cars will pollut the environment in twenty years not as much as today .in cinclusion , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , because of peoples behavour , the people in the emerging markets and the car and gaz industry .
