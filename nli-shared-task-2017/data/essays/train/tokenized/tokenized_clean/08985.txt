i dont agree to the topic given to me that young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is because , enjoyment is a vague term and there is no unique way of measuring enjoyment .the defination of enjoyment changes from person to person .i ca nt take a firm stand and state that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .lets take my own example .as a young guy , i love playing sports , freaking out with my friends , going on an adventurous trip , listening to music etc .i enjoy myself when i involve in these activities .this is enjoyment for me .lets take the example of my grandfather .he is not in a position to do all that i can do , but that does nt mean that he does not enjoy life or enjoys less than i do .he enjoys the serenity of the place he lives in , he enjoys playing with us and also enjoys spending quality time with our family .this is the meaning of enjoyment for him .what i really ca nt do is to measure his degree of enjoyment and compare it with mine .the defination of enjoyment might also change when i take an example of an other old man or an other young guy .lets consider an other old man who is fully fit and is in a position to indulge in all the activities that i really enjoy .though , the old man might not perform to the same level as i can but there is a possibility that he might enjoy doing the same .even in this case , measuring his degree of enjoyment and comparing it with mine is not possible .lets take the example of an other young guy who defines enjoyment as attaining success in his desired field of study .he might enjoy each and every step that is involved in making him a successful person .the same activity can be done by an old man but he might define enjoyment in a different way .he might enjoy only by reading the same and not having any sort of concern towards the result of such a study .i conclude my essay by saying that the term enjoyment is very vague and its difficult for me to take a firm stand on who enjoys more until and unless i am provided with a method or a formula that measures the degree of enjoyment for each and every individual .
