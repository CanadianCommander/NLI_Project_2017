i think that theoretical concepts and ideas are very important to prepare a student and to help him to built his own method of study .for example studying latin , with all those coniugations or maths give you a tool to develop your mind schematically .in my opinion this is a good training , but it does nt make a professionist .i believe that when a student reaches a certain level of theoretical preparation he needs facts : he needs to experience in first person what the issue he has studied is all about .learning from practical experiences is much easier and involving than studying a subject on a book .for example ; if i had the opportunity to go to united states and study english , i would improve my language skills much better than i could do staying at home and reading an english edition of oscar wilde !moreover is very important to consider the kind of subject the student is learning : many subjects need more practical training ( for example biology ) and so other ( as philosophy ) are better understood with concepts .think about those people who did nt have the opportunity to get an education ; all they learnt was basically taken from real facts : i can say that the skills they have , for example in formulating a conversation , pheraps does nt follow a logical pattern but if they can apport facts to substain such conversation it is not hard to understand what they are talking about .so i just partially agree with the statement and i think that the best choice would be to give to the student both the practical and theoretical training to ensure him a complete education .
