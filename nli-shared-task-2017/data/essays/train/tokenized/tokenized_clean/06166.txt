young people stand for the future of one society .it is worthy of discussing what they do when they are free .recently there are many reports of younth consumption of luxury purse and cosmetics in taiwan .young people are depicted as egocentric and indifferent to social conditions in such reports .is it true that the youth nowadays are no longer embodiment of passion to change the world ?examining carefully , there are many examples of enthusiastic young men to help their community .for instance , a group of sophomore and junior students in yang ming medical college annually visit yu li asylum to support therapists there .the prepartion begun at least one year earlier .these future doctors learn not only from textbooks but also from interacting with patients .they are not satistfied with a knowleage of disease and therapies ; human beings are their ultimate concerns .since some young people contribute their leisure to those who are in need , then where does the myth of aloof youth come from in taiwan ?i think there might be some reasons behind the prejudice to young people .nowadays young people are more daring to express their discontent to social realities than their parents did .but our society regards these opinions as pure complaint , a symbol of arrogance .this is the first mistake ,although some young people are busy indulging in various kinds of luxures , others are dedicated to improvement of where they live .it is not fair to deny the effort made by young people tip a tag of laziness .so i ca nt agree that young people nowadays do nt give enough time for their community .
