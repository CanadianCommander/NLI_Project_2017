the main tendency acting towards the reduction of cars is possibly a process of technological change .cars are progressively substituted by other machines , built to help people moving around .there are several forces behind this tendency .firstly , new technologies are produced to overcome problems of pollution .moreover , another problem raised by the diffusion of cars is the recurrence of episodes of traffic jam in the big modern city .clearly alternative ways of moving around these areas have been and will be continuosly searched .the last but no the least point is represented by the rising costs associated with car locomotion , first of all the cost of the petroleum .it is likely that trying to reduce costs private firms will introduce on the markets alternative techologies apt to move in cities .the main tendency which acts against the decline in cars in use is associated with the growth of developing countries .firs of all , in these countries , such as china , a similar culture and economy as those of western countries , based on consumerism and private interest , is developing .therefore similar kinds of goods are likely to be demanded to fulfil similar needs - such as that of moving around by car .moreover counttry such as the arab emirates are plenty of natural resources and will not face the problem of rising costs mentioned above .actually , while the technological change is slow because it is not possible to shift merely to an existing technology , the growth of developing countries is steadfast .furthermore developing alternative ways of motion is extremely expensive even if compared to the cost of energy , which can always be discharged on consumers by means of price inflation as the opec oil shocks experience shows .to sum up , i think that a boom in car use is imminent in the next twenty years .
