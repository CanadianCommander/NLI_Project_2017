i consider that as a human being , we are constantly making changes in our life , but generally we look for the things we know , because we like to be sure and confortable .i agree with the statement , because if you find out the stories of the people who has suceed in their life , they have done something different , and they took the risk of do it .usually the path they have walked is really hard , they do not give up , they learned how to deal with the difficulties .i consider that their best caracteristic is that they are selfconfidents , but after all that at the end they saw the results .all the things we do not know , allways give us scare , because the consequences are unkown , but in this world what we need is more enterpreuners , people who can start a business , who can improve the social responsability , who do not need others to make decisions .on the other hand , people who has only do what they know how to do well , do not let themselves try other opportunities and of course when you do things that you have never done before you learn , you know more people and this people can teach you to be a better person .i think that it is important to take risk , because it improve your knowledge about differents areas like the proffesional area , the sentimental area , the health area .and it also improve your relashionship with the enviroment .life is a group of different areas , concentrated in one person , who has the freedom to take risk or no .
