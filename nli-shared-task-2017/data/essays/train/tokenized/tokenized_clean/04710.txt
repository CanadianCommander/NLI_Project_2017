it is said that the understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts .there are many students who only try to check the facts because they are used to the test asking the choice of solution .however i think learning without understanding ideas and concepts is not effective and meaningless .to begin with , many students who do nt understand the profound ideas and concepts of the facts will not be able to solve the problems successfuly when they face the a little bit different problems .even though the problems requests students to find the other aspects of the general facts , students always apply the same facts to solve problems , moreover , they can not realize what the mistakes of their solution is .my brother graduated from a famous high school in korea with a good grade .however , when he studied in the university , he suffered from the lack of the understanding an important ideas and concepts of the facts .because the university education needed him to think over the problems considering the concepts and ideas .he finally gave up getting a degree in the university .at second , when students focus on the facts , they can not develope the skill that is necessary in the real life .we have to do many activities such as finding a problems and suggesting the sitable solution in the companies .at that time , we sometimes need to get the different point of general view for the more innovative solution .however , the students having no understanding of basic concepts and ideas could get the unique point of view .in conclusion , i can not agree the learning the only facts is enough to overcome and solve the every situations .without understanding ideas and concepts , there is no way to find the real method to solve the complex situations .so we need to motivate the students get the understanding of the profound concetps and ideas of the facts .
