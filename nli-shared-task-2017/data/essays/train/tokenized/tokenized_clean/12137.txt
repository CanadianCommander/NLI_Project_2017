i do not agree with this statement .although i consider it to be very important to have a solid knowledge of academic subjects in general , which means a certain amount of basic knowledge of different topics , i think that one should have a specific subject in which one is specialized and on which one should set ones main focuses .long ago , in the time of goethe and schiller or newton and descartes , it has been possible to acquire an amount of knowledge which offered the possibilty to take part in all important discussions about all scientific topics and even about art , literature and music .at that time it was possible to be an expert in different areas of science and culture and goethe for example even considered himself an expert in all sciences .but those times have passed .since scientists has made enormous and unparalleled discoveries and inventions throughout the last centuries the amount of knowledge which is accessible today is overwhelming .according to a study by the beginning of the 20th century this amount was doubling every seven years .today it is multiplied by seven every two years .hence no human beeing is able to deal with all of it and consequently it is necessary to have scientists go straight into one specific direction to create the possibilty to acquire even more knowledge .in mathematics for example there are topics about which only a dozen people in the world can exchange their ideas because nobody else would even understand the problems those persons are dealing with .so in order to make new inventions and discoveries as well as to enrich mankind s amount of knowledge it is undoubtably necessary to have experts who are specialized in specific subjects and who are constantly - or as mentioned before even exponentially - breaking scientific boundaries .so in the end many an invention would not have been made without the necessary experts .
