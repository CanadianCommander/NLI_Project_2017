i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .we can see many products advertisements like this statements .for example when i watched tv commercial of sandwitch or humbergare , the commercial really make me hungry and i want to eat that products becouse it looks very dericious and many vegitables and meets .but if i go to the store i ll see very different sandwitch or humbergare , those products looks more poor than tv commercials .i have disappointed it many times .in concludion , there are many advertisements .some people said that advertisement is very important role for selling .they update advertisement many times for few terms .if you want to sell some products a lot and want people to have interest you will make advertisements look good .i can understand this system for selling ; advertisements make products should seem more better than they really are .but i think that they should sell more simillar products to advertisements .
