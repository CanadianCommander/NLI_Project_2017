i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .cars come along with people .so i think the best way how to approach that topic is to startt with the population in 2026 .we will have to face dramatic population changes all over the world .while in europe and the united states the population density will decrease , asia and africa will grow to an , till now , unbelieveable size .talking about africa and asia , we talk about a mainly poor part of the world .growing up in europe and having had the chance to work in asia extensively , i experienced first hand the fascination of cars on poor people .having cars getting cheaper , and if you consider the latest products from china , it will not take long to have a big part of the chinese changing from bicyle to car .india , that is following right after china will be next , followed by african countries etc .to actually reduce the number of cars , an environmental awarness has to take part .this already started to happen in europe and the us and seeing the great increase of zip/cars , car sharing and the efforts cities undertake to provide a convenient and reliable network for public transportation , we are just entering the right way .a recent survey from bmw makes clear that the number of cars in the us and europe will pretty much stay the same , only the environmental performance of the car , like alternative fuel vehicles etc. will get better .in asia and africa this point is far down the road .first the desire for wealth , that mostly includes a car , needs to be satisfied .after going through the whole process of thinking about the environmental impact of cars on the world of our children , this may change to a `` better city , better life  which is also the theme for the expo 2010 in shanghai .we only can hope that asia surprises with the high speed to get on less cars as it does in the current high speed urbanism .you also need to question yourself where the old and worn out cars from europe and the states go to .not all end up at a junkyard .i remember that the old volvo of my father has been sold by the car dealer to namibia because there are no regulations and technical checks required by any authority .so in some way with our behaviour in the western world we contribute to the increase of cars in the world .we only can hope that the postfossil time will bring alternate and more social ways of travelling and transportation and that one day we have to go to a museum to explain the word `` car  to our grandchildren .
