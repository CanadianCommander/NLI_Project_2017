there are more automobiles on the face of the planet today than any time in the history .and the number is increasing at an alarming rate .the growing economies of the asian giants , china & india , are increasing with an average rate of 8 % per annum .there are more white collar and blue collar jobs in these countries than ever .this is bringing more money than ever to the people of the continent , and a car is not an exclusive luxury , not as exclusive as it used to be anyway .in india , since the almost full disposal of the red-tape , over 20 major car-manufacturors have set up producing plants all over the country .in the past 13 years only , the number of cars in the country has rose by over 400 % to about 29 million .according to certain researches , by 2025 , over 270 million indians and 390 million chinese would be able to afford to have a car .in the developed world , there are alternate modes of transport , both public and private , that whilst being energy efficient are also enviornment friendly .in the third world countries though such modes of transport are not readily available .also there is the lack of a viable transport infrastructure in these countries .maybe in a few decades , as the infrastructure improves , people will take to using public transport .but on the other hand , it s also possible that with the improving economies they d be able to afford a personal car too .the rising price of oil and natural gas is driving the world towards finding and developing alternative fuel resources , but it is nt still discouraging people to give up the comfort of personal cars .corporations and businesses in america for instance advice their employees to ` carpool  .although this means that there are fewer number of cars on the roads during rush-hours , it does nt in anyway imply that those people donot have a car parked in their garage .i strongly believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
