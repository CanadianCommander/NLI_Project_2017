i completely agree with the statement , i always stood by the saying that `` variety is the spice of life  .things have to be dynamic to be interesting .what would you want to watch ?a thundering waterfall or a pool of stagnant water .the people who meet success realise this very well , even boredom has to be credited partially because generally when you re bored you try to find a new source for inspiration and chances of an idea turning into innovation arises here .since money has been a long time scale to measure success let me use that scale , i say business .the men who have ventured into new fields have excelled and have been credited for both their money and idea .that s one of the major reasons that we see that the forbe s list is generally dominated by the people who have invested and worked in new age business arenas rather than traitional ones .innovation does nt always calls for drastic changes , its not only about the end product but also about the way in which the product is manufactured ( operations , logistics , strategy , tactics etc ) .the general perception that adventuring into unknown territories is more risky than moving around your own house does nt always hold .the first person to start a new venture will have the maximun potential and the the word exclusivity plays a big part here .a known field is always full of competition and rivalry - which does compensate the comfort of familiarity .so risk as a matter of fact is never absolute and should always be judged by the magnitude of the outcome that it can trigger .we have to remember that had the risks taken by people have helped us advance .a sailor s risk resulted in a great country , a soldier s risk resulted in the end of tyranny and a doctors s risk resulted in a saving a life .
