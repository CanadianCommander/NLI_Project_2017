i disagree the yong people do not give enough time to helping their communities .i guess every people should respect and help each other .joining community is good way to learn any little society of the group .the young people should take communication in the community place as possible as they can .now , we have a many ways to communicate with person who you are interested in .unfortunately , some younger generations does not like to give enough time to helping their communities .first , giving enough time to their community is the important for yong people .i understand that some yong people would like to be alone thermselfs and keep their own time .sometimes , it is good chance to think own proble just themselves , however , the person who joined the community may gives a second opinion .also , in the young people community , they can meet your friends in the community .we do not alive without our community .in my experices , i found my best friends in my communities when i was 17years old .finally , young people should give to help their communities .young people can learn any educational experiences from their communities .sometimes young people communies make some troubles but you should not be shy to join community .
