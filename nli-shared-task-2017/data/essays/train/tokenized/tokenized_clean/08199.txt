i agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .it is in the interest of advertisers to show their products in a better way .i believe that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are because they are trying to sell us a product that we do not really need .therefore , advertisers use beautiful people in their commercials to convince us that by buying their product we can look just like them .for example , it is common to see on tv an anti-wrinkle cream commercial with a beautiful model that did not have wrinkles to start of .most advertisements try to make us feel better for buying their products .therefore , advertisers present the producs they are trying to sell in a better presentation than the one their products originally have .for example , we ussualy see food comercials were the product looks much better and tastier than it really is .we actually get disapointed once we try that product .advertisement agencies are private businesses that have to generate profits for their shareholders .as a result , advertisers will use every possible scheme to trick us into buying their products .i believe that commercials and other advertisements should be viewed with a critical eye .it is in the best interest of advertisers to make us beleive that their products are much better than they really are .as a result , advertisers use models and paid actors to convince us into buing their products .advertisments make their products seem much better than they really are in order for us to buy them .advertisment agencies are business that look out for their own interests , and that will use almost every mean to achieve these interests .
