the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  is very true in my opininion .first , if this sentence is taken and placed in a political context , many examples appear that illustrate the truthfulness of the sentence .for example , the late president sadat of egypt introduced a new economic program to the country called `` infitah  in arabic and which means `` to be open  in english .this program was new to the country because it involved open trade with any country in the world , unlike the old system which was a socialist or a closed trade system .that system had many critics at the time it was adopted but sadat took the risk and implemented the program which turned to be a great economic success for the country .second , the statement is true when looking at it from a business point of view .for example , bill gates , the owner of microsoft , tried a lot of new things and invented a lot of software that turned out to be very successful although there were great risks for its failure at the begininning .moreover , the word `` innovation  is used by many businesses nowadays to illustrate thier belief in new things and anything new must have great risks at first .major companies have entire departments directed for research and development , also called `` r & d ,  and they spend huge amounts of money to fund these departments .therefore , the business enviroment believes that new things lead the way for profit and thus success .in conclusion , i totally agree with the statement because it could be applied in any context and found to be true .being innovative in any aspect , whether in politics , economics , or business , will deffinetly lead to success but with great risks involved .
