i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .first of all , traveling with a tour guide is easier and more efficient than any other way to travel .the groups led by a tour guide usually have a well-designed schdule and members in the group are able to visit as many places in a short period as possible .moreover , even though the members do not know the language spoken in the place they visit , they have less trouble with the help of the tour guide .for example , when i traveled in the united states ten years ago , i joined a tour led by a tour guide .the bus that exclusively drove for us led us to the famous sight-seeing spots in new york city , such as the empire state building and the world trade center .dinner was planned at famous restaurants in little italy .at night , we all went to see a musical show , which was at the time very popular and was hard to get the tickets for .if i had not joined the tour , i could not have seen the musical show .this example clearly show sthat traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better .second , traveling with a tour guide gives people opportunities to learn more about the local cultures and history .for example , i hired a tour guide when i traveled in st. petersburg , russia .there are many famous buildings and museums in and out of the city , and i wanted to visit all of them especially the largest one in the city .on the day we visited the meseum there was a long , long line in front og the main entrance , but the tour guide led us to another small entrance of the museum and we were able to get in without waiting for a long time .inside the museum , she led us to the rooms with famous paintings and decorations which all the tourists must see .she also gave us lectures about arts , history , and kings and queens that all related to the museum history .by her explanation , i was able to understand russian culture of the time .because she was a russian guide , she knew very well about the area .after our tour finished , she took a group to the restaurant where pucikin , a russian writer , would have meals everyday .the experience was unforgettable .in conclusion , i definitely agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
