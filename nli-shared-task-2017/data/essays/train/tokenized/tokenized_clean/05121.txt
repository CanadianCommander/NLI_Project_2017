i think the topic of having enough time to help communities when you are young is complex and controversial .while some people argue that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , i think , however , that young people do give a tremendous amount of time their communities .my position is based on several reasons .first of all , young people who are growing up in a community have already tight connections to several members of the community .for instance , i grew up in a relatively small community .my grandparents and parents have already taken over responsibilities in the community .so , it became natural to me to be part of this community , to learn from adults on how to interact in a community , whom to ask for help .for example , when i was fifteen i asked one member who was the librarian of our community , if i can work in the library to earn some money .so i already was part of the community when i was a teenager and invested my time , although this was rewarded .secondly , i increased my time spending on helping our community after i experienced that being part of the community is also beneficial in situations where you need good friends .for instance , as my grandfather died , our whole family got support from our community .although this was more a kind of emotional support is was really helpful to know that other people do take care of my familiy and me .this experience motivated me to further take over responsibilities in the community .even if the impact of these responsibilities sometimes seems to be small , people perceive them as helpful .for example i used to buy bread for our old neighbour on sundays .seeing me on sundays was a highlight of her lonely day .furthermore , all my friends at my age are in some manner connected with our community .they are also working in their leisure time for the community .we are a kind of big family and everyone takes care of each other .nevertheless , some people might object that young people tend to sit in front of their computers or to have parties all the time .but from my experience i can say that my friends do also use their computers , we do have parties , but we also include our charity work in the community in our daily routine .in conclusion , based on my experiences and background i am convinced that at least a lot of young people nowadays give a huge amount of time to helping their communities , thus improving the live of other community members .
