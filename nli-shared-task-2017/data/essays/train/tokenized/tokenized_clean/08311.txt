a plethora of methods of traveling are available these days .the main two ways would be traveling privately and traveling publicly .in other words , a person can travel by himself/herself or with a small group of familiar people and he/she can also travel in a tour guide .although traveling in a group led by a tour guide would allow me to gain more information about a particular place that i travel in , i would rather travel by myself or with my friends or family .one of the requirements of tour guides is that there is a specific schedule that everybody has to follow .therefore , the people in a tour guide have to change their daily lifestyles .when i went to a college tour with my friend , i had to wake up much earlier then i usually do and eat meals at times that i was not used to .in addition , if somebody fails to follow the schedule , everybody else has to wait and the trip would not be as pleasant .consequently , it is better to travel in a private group .not only following a schedule , but also confronting unfamiliar people could be uncomfortable during a trip .there are usually a myriad of people who are unfamiliar ; therefore , they can not act naturally or be themselves with each other .since being comfortable is very significant and valuable in a trip , traveling in a tour guide is not preferable .another aspect of traveling that a tour guide lacks is the limit of time and place .since there are specific times and places , people might not be able to go somewhere they wanted to or stay as long as they wanted to .therefore , traveling with a tour guide is not an effective way to fully enjoy a trip .some people who consider traveling in a group led by a tour guide as the best way to travel might suggest that people can go to important and historical places that average people might not be aware of .however , this advantage can be easily achieved by simply researching or reading books about a particular place .as a result , a professional help from a tour guide is not necessary to accomplish the best experiences of traveling .
