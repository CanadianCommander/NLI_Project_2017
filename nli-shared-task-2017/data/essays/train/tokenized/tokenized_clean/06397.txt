i believe that every one have an experience of watching or listening to a advertisements .do you ever think those advertisement really plays and important role for their products ?or are those products seem much better than they really are ?in my point of view , advertisements really works well for those who make the business , it motivates cunsumer to purchase on their items , but if we take a close look at some commercials on the tv , their always presenting you the positive side of their products , instead of the things that have left behind , for example , we often see some shampoo commercials on tv , using those ladys with long hair showing you that if you use this brand of shampoo you will have the same shining hair as the lady have on the commercials .this obviously is not true , on the tv they are putting on some chemicals that make their hair look smoothly and shining , but not the really affect that cused by the real product that they persuade the consumer to buy .that s why i highly do nt agree with the commercials .another example , if we go on shopping at some supremarkets , you will see all kinds of delicious images on the paces , like forzen pizzas , this image shows you that it got variety of ingredients on it and the size of the pizza .we might think this is what the pizza going to be look like after i take back home and cook it , but infortuantly it s not what you thought , those images are only look good on the pack for cosumers to buy it , in order to get the profit form the consumers .so would you still believe in those advertisements ?these advertisements might have a good looking on the outside , but what really in the inside we ll never able to know .so think carefully before you purchase , do nt let those unreal images affects you and take away you money .
