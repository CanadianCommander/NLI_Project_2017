i live in a city and i can see everyday so many cars moving in the streets and a lot of traffic .people are stressed and they are fed up of queues and skip in their timetables .this incredible amount of cars moving does nt have positive effects of course !i think that pollution is the first consequence of the increasing number of cars .that-s why i would prefear a cars reduction in the future .at the same time i recognize the importance in having your own vehicle , you can go wherever you want , with no barriers and constrictions in timetables , like for busses or trains .anyway i think that there are several ways to avoid pollution without reducing the number of vehicles .first of all , i think that in the future there will be dicovered the existence of particular kinds of fuels to prevent pollution , there are already some of them in use .the second solution i would suggest , is the increment in electric vehicles business .today there are some of them in use , but they are not so common maybe because they are too expensive .any way i think that if everybody start to buy this kind of vehicle , its price will be reduced .furthermore , pollution doest seem to be the only consequence of increasing in cars , but there is also a lot of traffic , as i mensioned before talking about my city .traffic makes a city unliveable !first of all traffic has an effect on a person well being i think , it s stressful , and then i think that it always makes you change your programs and your timetable , that s why i think that in a future people will change vehicle anyway .for me , a solution to cars increasing could be the emprovement of public vehicles > undergrounds , trains , busses everyday more efficient and faster .in such a way the pollution will be reduced but at the same time there will be less traffic in return of your own well being .
