nowadays , cars roam every part of the city .it seems as if there was never a moment in time when these vehicles are not out on the street .however , cars could very well suffer a decrease in twenty years due to skyrocketing prices and environmental issues .having a car is an expensive luxury , and that may be one of the reasons why they may disappear .car prices are not getting any cheaper , in fact , all the commercials on television promote cars with new gadgets and more powerful engines , making buying one more expensive , and therefore making less people buy one .secondly , gasoline prices are increasing daily .as a matter of fact , prices of gasoline are reaching historical records and filling a tank can cost a fortune .not only is the price of the gasoline worrying , but the fact that gasoline is getting scarcer by the minute will mean that once petroleum runs out , which scientists estimate will happen in 50 years , gasoline-powered cars will no longer be in use .not only is price a key factor in the reduction of the number of cars , but the fact that people are becoming more and more concerned with the environment is also something that could trigger the number of cars to decrease .more and more people take public transportation , such as buses and trains , because it saves time , money , and the environment .in the last few years more campaigns about using public transportation in spain have been done , pointing out how cars pollute .in fact , a survey has been carried out and the results reveal that people are becoming more environmentally friendly and that campaigs for the use of public transport are effective .this new `` concience  will lead people to replace their cars for cleaner ways of transport .last but not laest , more and more cities have public transport and this type of transport is being modernized on a daily basis .due to the increase of different types of public transport and their quality , many people go to work by train or bus instead of getting the car .not only is public transport faster and more convenient , allowing you to avoid traffic , but it is much cheaper than filling the gas tank and paying the parking meter .all in all , cars , as i see it , will slowly tend to be used less often because of the circumstances surrounding us : gasoline prices are skyrocketing , car prices are extremely high , the environment can not survive if this rate of contamination continues , and there are many other better alternatives out there .looking closely at the matter , if not using the car saves money , time and our environment , why wait 20 years ?cars should be used less often right now .
