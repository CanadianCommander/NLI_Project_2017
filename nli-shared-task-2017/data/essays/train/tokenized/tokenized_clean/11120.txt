coming to the end of my undergraduate education in the area of molecular biology and genetics , know is the time for me to select a specific subject from my area to begin graduate studies .in four years , we have covered a broad range of topics from cancer to pathogenic bacteria .definetely , knowing a bit from all topics in this scope will be a hard and unproductive task .this idea applies to interdisciplinal studies in academic subjects .firstly , a short glance to the academic programs of any university would reveal the broadness of programs .trying to obtain knowledge in all or at least in several of these areas will push the limits of a normal human being .secondly , it is a fact that the more subjects you learn about , the less specific information you will have on each of them .i always thought that having a shallow knowledge on many things is not a very desirable thing .i am a person who would like to be focused on one thing and dive into deepnesses of that thing .another thing is that , a person excelling on one particular subject is given supplementary information from other areas .in other words , you do not see the life of cell for four full years in molecular biology , it is blended with mathematics , physics and chemistry .a last reason for why i am opposing the idea of having a broad knowledge of many subjects is because i believe that everyone should be contained in their own subject and should not jump to the others  .if i knew statistics as good as i knew microbiology ; why would there be a need for a statistician ?to conclude my discussion , i would again like to emphasize the importance of co-working of experts from different areas in harmony to achieve the big thing , rather than one person trying to know and achieve everything just by himself .
