i agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i myself is reluctant to participate in community activities .the reasons are varied .for example , the mid autumn festival is coming , the bar-be-cue seems just not so interesting to attend because you need to do it with a group of elderly people .community borad often expects young adults to do all kinds of chores simply because they are younger and more engetic .it is true but young people lose their interests in attending under this logical consequence .if a communitiy only expects young people to contribute rather than gain benefits , why would young adults join the activities it offers .community activities are usually designed for families in the neighbordhood .the subjects would be natually grandparents , parents and children .it costs a lot to design a program that is suitable for everyone s needs .if each house as a unit to decide what they want to do within their own budget , it will attract more interests for people to spend their holidays .besides , community s activities are very limited in kind .they may just have kraok , bar-b-cue and riddles .i would believe young adults will chose what is suitable for them outside of the community and have fun as much as possible , such as ktv instead of kraok or movie .it may be even more exciting by going to a bar and drink to their upmost with their close friends .after all , it is much more fun in the world outside than the daily in and out neighborhood .one major issue in community is garbage .not every community has a good system of running recycle items .people have the tendency to leave their garbages in a certain spot where nobody is at the scene seeing them do that .graduately , it becomes a trash mountain .it is very common in taiwan .with issue like this , community needs volenteers to guard the spot and supervise the dumping process when trash truck comes .young adults have energy to do that but they are not so respectable enough to argue with elderly ladies or men .it increases the reluctances for young people to interact with their neighbours .it is reasonable that young people keep their noses out of community board .it is just too much to handle to a young adult .
