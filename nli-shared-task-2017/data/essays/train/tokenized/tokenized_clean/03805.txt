the question wheather it is generally really better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is not easy to answer since it depends highly on the context .undergraduate study courses should indeed offer the students a variety of subjects so they gain a broad knowledge of different areas .then , this knowledge can function as a basis to specialize in postgraduate studies .i consider both the gain of broad knowledge as a first step and the specialization in one subject as a second step to be very important for the following reasons :on the one hand , due to technical invention , among others the improved communication means , contemporary knowledge is growing faster than ever before in the past .no human is able to learn everything that has been discovered by scientists so far .in conclusion , the attempt to gain a deeper knowledge in each academic area must fail .one can only gain a deep knowledge in very limited subjects .therefore , specialization is necessary since science need researchers who are experts in the area they are working .on the other hand , for the same reason that the world is much more connected than it used to be , there is also the need for every student to have a basic knowledge of other areas than the one he is specializing in for different sciences are more connected and work together more often than in the past .in conclusion , basic broad knowledge is necessary as a basis to specialize in one certain area .
