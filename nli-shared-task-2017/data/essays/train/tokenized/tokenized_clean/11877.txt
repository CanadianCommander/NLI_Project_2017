yes .i agree .because as the tv , internet , developed to help people get the information really easy .to make people notice is not a problem .but the product is not only sold by one company .in order to let people spend their money buying the products become really important .advertisements always use something shacked word and well noticed senctice to effect peolpe s desire of shopping .for example medicine .some company will use many people to show how their product works and compare with different company .but as we know it depend on different body s effect .in some fast food restaurant the picture of the meal usually looks like full and hot .for some reason to make it fast and commercial way , it is really difficult to make it looks like the picture .in the company , there must have different people make the product and the advertisements .in order to finish their job .they both want to do the best .advertisements is the first line to the customors .sometimes the product may be just ok but if it had a good advertisement it could probably change customors  mind .that works , the company made money .and the people not only buy their product but the most important things the ad .advertisements made people fight with their desire .when people paid the money and find out that they did not satisfyed .because we always want better or more .sometimes in our mind feels that we should nt spend that much just for that things and find a reason to argue .but anyway advertisements works .that is why the company rather spend their money on the advertisements than on the mass of product .consider to the products , if it just ok and not really far as the advertisements people still accept it .take a look carefully before we buy .
