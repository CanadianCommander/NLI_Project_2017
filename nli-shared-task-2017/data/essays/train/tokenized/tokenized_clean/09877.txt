after the world war ii , the development of the influstructure especially the development of the car have increased rapidly .however the perspectives of people who are using cars changes gradually in recent years .in my opinion , the use of cars in twenty years will be decrease as the development of the influstructure and technology .first of all , there are a lot of people who are concerning about the impact of using cars to the environment .in some countries such as in netherland and china , they work on the policy of using bicycles to avoid producing carbon-dioxide gas , which possibly damages the natural environment .however , there are some countries that says co2 gas is not neseccarry for damaging the environment , therefore it is not always a majorities idea of decreasing the number of using cars .second of all , there are more public transportations such as busses , trains and air transportations are developping by new technology .for example , there are many railways in japan to transform people one place to the other faster and more convenient .also in taiwan and china , they built the bullet train or maglev train which transport group of people at once , and also think about the impact on nature .also in the less economically developped countries such as the countries in african region , it would be harder to get car for individual residences due to the civil war and poorvaty , it is important to produce the cheap public transportation for them .therefore , i think the increasing number of car users will not be occured in the ledcs .third of all , since many countries of more developped countries such as in singapore , japan and switherland , the decreasing in number of child becomes a sesrious problem .in these countries , the government are likely to set the law to get more than four people to ride the cars , therefore the number of the cars might decrease gradually .since the time passed , people s perspectives of using car changing .i think this fact would make the number of cars fewer than now .
