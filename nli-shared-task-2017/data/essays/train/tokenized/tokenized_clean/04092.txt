when economy grows in a country , more people are able to purchase their own private cars .in this regard , more people may have cars in twenty years in thailand .as far as bangkok is concerned , however , i disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .currently , too many cars are on road with less proper regulations and these cars have caused environmental and health problems .since these problems are geting more serious , the civil society , which may grow more in forthcoming decades in thailand , urges the thai government to restrict the number of cars in bangkok and the government has started to take actions as follows .first , the thai government has been aware of necessity of more public transportationss due to the current trafic situation in bangkok .in the morning and evening , people commuting by cars including their privaite vehicles and buses have to spend a lot of time ; this is really wast of time for individuals and the country s development .if people can use more varieties of trains with an affordable price and convenient manner , they will of course prefer using them .in this sence , it is important for the government to continue to develop the underground train and sky-train system not only in bangkok but also its suverbs .according to the plan of the bangkok metropolitan authority , i am sure that a lot more lines of these trains will be constructed in twenty years .second , alike singapre and other countries , the government will enforce a proactive regulation for reducing the number of private cars in bangkok .for example , specific rush hours in morning and evening , a car should have 4 passengers including a driver .besides , when bangkok has become more developed , the price of its real estate will increase .due to it , the parking lots will have to charge much more than now .this has been seen already in a big city like tokyo , where people avoid using their car for shopping since the parking fee is sometimes more expensive than their purchase at the shopping center .
