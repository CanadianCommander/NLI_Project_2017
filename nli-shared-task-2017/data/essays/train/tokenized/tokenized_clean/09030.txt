education is something which increases the self-esteem and improves knowledge of the one who tries to pursue that .it also increases stature , which is of primary concern in today s society .given the two options , it would not be a good idea to deal these two options in the same way .so , i would like to view this topic in two different ways :1.undergraduate level2.graduate levelfirst , during undergraduate studies , a student has to learn a wide variety of subjects because it is the high time for him to learn the basics .if he does not study many subjects , there wont be a difference between him and uneducated person .after all , everybody expects him to be familiar with all the related subjects present in a stream .for example , a mechanical engineer is assumed to have knowledge about thermal , production , design , material sciences and many more subjects related to his mechanical stream .because all these depend upon one another , it becomes absolute necessity to learn the fundamentals of all these in order to excel in mechanical field .and the same is true about all the remaining streams too .there is one more disadvantage , if he studies only one subject at this part of his life , he would probably find it boring and insipid as time passes , and would definitely end up becoming nothing in his life .secondly , during graduate level , it would be a better option to select any one of the subjects he is familiar with , and deal with that particular subject in detail .then , he will gain in-depth knowledge about a subject and that can help him in achieving a good job in his respective domain .later on , even if he finds the domain boring , he can drift towards different subject because he has the fundamental knowledge of many subjects .keeping these two choices in view , i would suggest to gain basic fundamentals in your undergraduate level and then go on search for a topic which fascinates you and then pursue in-depth knowledge of that particular subject in your graduate and doctoral level .in this way , you can become a jack of all trades , and , indeed a master of few too .
