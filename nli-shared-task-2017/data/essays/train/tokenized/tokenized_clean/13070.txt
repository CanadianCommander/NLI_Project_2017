when i read this statement , i automatically think that it is right , young people enjoy life more than older people do .but if i think on it , it appears to be , in fact , the contrary . ..it is true that young people have the discover everything .when one is born , one has to learn and to built all of who one wants to be .therefore , a young person has to try and to search all that he can , to know who he is .in that sens , he enjoys life more than older people , who already know who they are .it is also true that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life tham older people .the education system permit them to meet many different persons , until the entrance in the professional life : the student has to change of educating place all his student life , with the school , the highshool , the college , etc . ..at the contrairy , older people already have a durable placement in their company , and therefore have less occasions to meet other persons .finally , we know that young people make sports and have activities that older people can not exerce .that is the first impression that i have when i read the statement .but i am young and that is why my spirit only saw avantages for young people .if i am objective , it is obvious that older people also enjoy life .they have their life already lined , that is true , but all the exemples of adults around me show me that it is not a reason for us tu stop their hobbies and to stay at home without doing anything to enjoy their life .my father , for instance , decided to quit my mother because he founds his life too calm . ..he has many friends , and now he profits of everythings more than , even if i am younger . ..with the world of today , and the globalization , we can have only one job for our entire life , that i why older people have the opportunity to change oh life , to discover other things and other fields .when we travel , we can see that the majority of tourists are not very young , and i thing that travelling is the best way to enjoy life .all these reasons show that older people can enjoy life as well as young people do , and even more .it is only a different way to enjoy things .that is why i disagree , after reflection , with the statement .
