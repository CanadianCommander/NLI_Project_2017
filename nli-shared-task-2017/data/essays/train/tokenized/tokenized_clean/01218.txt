i strongly agree with this idea .i really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .if i understand an idea or concept i can really go deeply in a subject and remember it for long time .also , i can apply that idea to other situations .on the other hand , if i just learn facts i will have just superficial knowledge and i will remember those facts for short time .probably , it is going to be difficult for me to apply that knowledge to other scenarios .first , it is very important to deeply understand concepts and to remember them for years .from my personal experience i can say that i studied literature in high school not only reading the books but also analizing them in their context .knowing who the author was , when the book was written , for example .with that ideas in mind i could understand better what a text said and i can still explain that topic to other people .on the contrary , i studied biology just with facts .for instance , i learnt the name of parts of the body and their location , but i never understood how they worked .if someone asks me about that field , i would have to say that i do not know much and also i do not remember even the facts .second , i think that a good way to use the knowledge is applying it in different situations .to do that we need to understand very well what concepts we know and how they are related with others .although we have a big list of facts , we can not use the esence of that subject in a new challenge .for example , to play the piano i have to learn how to read music .i can not just learn wich key in my piano is do , re or mi .i have to understand that the notes are a representation of music and in that way it is going to be possible for me to play any piano , keybord or even othe instruments .as a conclusion i can say that if a student wants to learn , he or she has to understand the ideas and concepts first .the facts are also important , but they are nothing if the student can not explain how they are related or if he or she can just repeat words without a deep meaning behind them .
