nowadays , a lot of people use their car for traffic .but , some people say car is not good for the enviroment and migh think that there will be fewer cars in use in the future .car is really convenient because when people go somewhere , they do not need to use their own power .even if people become old or tired , they can drive it .and car is going to be more useful because of adding new functions such as navigation .people can watch movie in their car and also can listen to music and radios .car become gradually more comfortable .people probably hoped to increase cars in the future .others think that car is unnecessary for their life .in japan , long time ago , people used horses to carry people .this does not need any resources such as petrol and this does not pollute the air .furthermore , train is really useful to transmission .train is usually moved by electricity .and rate of accident is fewer than cars .when people gat drank , they use train because the goverment does not allow to drive their car .in conclusion , i prefer number of cars is going to decrease in our future because i want to die by accidents and i also hope to save people life .and i really consider about the enviroment .the earth has a lot of enviromental problems , for example , acid rain , ozon hole and increasing temperature .these ploblems almost happen from the gas of cars .even if we do not have car , we can live or we might live more ease life .in addition , i suggest to echology cars for enviroment .and car companies have to think about safe more when they produce cars .if the goverment should ban to drive a car , some people might disagree with it so the goverment have to try to ask some opinions from people .
