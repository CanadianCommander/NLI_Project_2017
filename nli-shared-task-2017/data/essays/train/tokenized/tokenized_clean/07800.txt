yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .people become success because of taking risks in their work .according to the proverb `` success will not come to us , we must to it  indicates best to wards hardwork .risks is the thing which leads the path to your success .without risks a success man is like a body without soul .the successful peoples try to take risks in every day of life .they know the value of success and they also know that it will not come without risks .the successful people always try to become more successful than the other successful person .for this reason his take risks in his every part of his life .the true value of success can be only be known by the person who takes risks .for example consider the example of the poilet .the poilet want to became success in his aeroplane driving .he takes risks in every aspects of his life .he takes risks from the starting the aeroplane till the landing .but become success one day or the other .that s why success include hard work and risks .there are many examples in which risks includes , the best and popular example is the child riding the bicycle .the child knows the fear of falling down from the cycle and getting the enjoury but still rides .he want to the success in his riding .even though he may fell down and get injured but never stop the his goal to become success .the success comes from the inspiration of own mind and soul .for every success risks are the four most step .if one can step the first and four most step of risks then he is successful person in his life .if the successful people think that his the successful person and do same as already he did then he will be in only same position and get decreased day by day .risks are the smaller things for the successful peoples .they take risks as taking water .they just see the goal not the problems they are facing and what might the risks they can get .they just take the risks and try to become more successful from the previous .risks are not the things which you can not do it just imagination of the problem in mind .so i finally agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks  .
