for me success means profiting from my doing .for example when i take a final exam in a university class i want to succeed .i normally choose courses refering to my interests and also to my abilities .of course i want to be challenged by the topics , i want to learn new things in class but i also do nt want to be overchallenged .finally i choose a `` medium path  .some risk in combination with some facts that make me feel safe .i can choose the medium path with taking in account two factors : the special situation and my well-being .to the first facor i think that the situation should decide whether i go for a risk or not because it tells me how much i can profit from a doing and how much the doing will be challenging .for example when i get the chance to talk in front of an audiance about a for me very unknown topic and i could win a sholarship with the talk , i would rather take the risk then stay at home .the talk then does not only mean a risk for me - it also means a challenge in that situation .the second and very important factor is my personal character and my trait profile .am i an axious person ?how do i feel in unknown situation ?do i like risky and dangerous situations ?and how are my exoeriences with risk ?if i only have had good experiences with risk i will be more self confident and will succeed with a higher probability .but if i am forced to take a risk i won  t feel good and the success wo nt be reachable that easily .in summarize i think success and risk depends on an interaction of situation , personality and experiences .some successful people may have often tried out risky things .others probably took a less risky way and succeeded .
