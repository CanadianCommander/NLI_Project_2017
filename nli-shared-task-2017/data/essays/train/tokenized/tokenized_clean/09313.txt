i agree with the statement that in twenty years cars will be fewer in use than today .i agree , because i know that the fossils like oil will be quite rare in the future on earth .because of that , the oilprices will raise up , so that not everybody is rich enough to buy the expencive oil for their cars .also , i have the opinion that in the next few years lot of laws will found to save the nature and i hope that the people notice that they have to change anything , if they want to live on earth more than twenty years .i guess that more people will use the train or the plain to get to a foreign country for their vacation .because they it will be cheaper than going by car and they are more comfortable .also , i think , that the export from food , clothes and other important things will be not do by trucks .i think that the things will export by train , ship and plane .my last reason is , that i guess , that people don not need their car anymore because most of the people live in big citys or towns .in citys everything ist close to you , like supermarkets , jobs , schools and cinema .so you can do your way by foot and do nt have to use your car .
