i agree with the statement that advertisements often make the product appear better than it really is -- but i would claim that this is hardly surprising if one considers the function of advertisement .basically , advertisement serves two purposes : to inform the consumer of the product s existence , and to motivate him or her to purchase the product .the advertiser s intention is to sell the product , not to provide comprehensive details about pros and cons .thus , advertisement will aways focus on the positve aspects of a product and omit any negative ones .truth-in-advertising laws and consumer protection organizations will prevent fraudulent claims and gross misrepresentations of the true product , but advertisements usually still take a few liberties .a famous example is a scene from the movie `` falling down  in which the main character is enraged by the fact that a fast food restaurant depicts a hamburger as large and succulent , while the product he gets is flattened , mushy and disgusting .of course , the film exaggerates , but seldom does one find processed food to look as appealing in reality as it does in adverts or on boxes .usually , small notices such as `` serving suggestion  exempt the manufacturer from liability .another means by which products are made to look better in advertisements is the modification of context .for example , many car adverts show the car driving at high speed through a desert or such , with the driver being completely relaxed and casual .while this makes the car look more appealing , reality with its speed limits and heavy traffic makes it unlike that one will actually max out the vehicle in such a manner .this all might seem like a consumer watchdog s nightmare , but one must always bear in mind the function of advertisement , as i have already mentioned .it just is , by definition , a one-sided view with a certain purpose -- selling .to assume it to be something else -- a valid , unbiased source of information -- would be fallacy .it remains the consumers  responsibility to compare and evaluate , based on independent reviews and the like , when choosing a product .
