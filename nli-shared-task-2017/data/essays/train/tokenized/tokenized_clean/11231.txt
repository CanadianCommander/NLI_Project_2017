in my opinion , i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .i agree that it is important to learn facts , but if a student end only learning facts without understanding the ideas or concept this will be a mess .firstly , i agree completely with the statement because since i was a child i was educated : first to understand the idea and concept and after learning the fact .however , although it is important to learn some key facts it is not as important as it is to learn the meaning or understand the idea .secondly , i also agree with the statement because it reminds me while i was studying medicine and a classmate of mine learned with his father how to make a `` heart operation  but without even knowing the risks involved in the operation .imagine how dangerous could be for a person to be operated by a student who does nt understand what he is doing .it would be better if he study , understand the concept/idea and after that he learn how to do it .by contrast , it is also true that some persons starts learning the facts and after that they manage to understand the idea and the concept .but this is not the common way , neither the best nor the ideal .i also agree with the statement because it is prooved that this is the correct way how to proceed .if they want to know and learn the facts they need first to understand the ideas and concepts .to conclude , if i was a teacher and i am in front of the following statement or with the doubt of how to teach to my students , i would make them first to understand the ideas and concepts and afterwards to learn the facts .
