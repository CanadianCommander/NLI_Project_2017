what makes a person successful ?is it the amount of money they make , the car they bought with it , or the house they live in ?i believe that success is more than just having a lot of money .to be a successful individual a person has to go through many obstacles without stoping , and has to have a clear vision of the future .we may find someone that is really good in a certain task .but success is not just being good at something .i believe that it means to be the best at it .in the present times people go through life trying to grasp anything they can get .there s no such thing as easy money .because of the dificulty of getting a job , paying bills , and having enough money to pay for your child s $ 30,000 per year education , many people have found themselves absorbed by life s preassure .they stoped thinking about the future and have focus in the present .i believe people have become conformists and many mediocre .they are tired of working so hard and not improoving , so when they finally find something that s ok , they ll stay with it because they are too afraid of loosing the little something they ve got .most humans do nt feel confortable in an unknown environment .this makes it hard for these people to take a risk and move towards the unexplored .they do nt care if it ll bring something better .the fear of change disables them to become better .so a successful person is not the one that stays with what he or she already knows how to do well , but rather that other person who takes the risk and searches for self improovement .it is not enough to have one goal in life .what are you supposed to do when you acomplish it ?are you done ?is there no other reason for you to keep on living ?i truellly think that a successful person will always have something more to acomplish .miving from one objective to the next will make you go higher than being passive and staying in the secure zone .
