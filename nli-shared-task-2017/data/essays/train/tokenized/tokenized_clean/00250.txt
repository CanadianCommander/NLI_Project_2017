`` yes  , i agree to statement which is given as `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .now-a-days people looking for such good companies which will stay for long time , because now there are so many people are introducing such new models like `` accent  , `` zen maruthy  , and so many other cars model names older and newer , also one company is modifying one companies model and changing a little and releasing it again with their names .but only few companies will stay for long time because they will not depend on other companies models , public believe that companies too .i feel how many years it go only the good product companies stay for long time .those companies stays for long time their success is in making the goods in convincible manner .also they will use only perfect engines , looks for better milage , comfortable steering and sitting arrangements with a.c. includnig in future in all type of cars .if some cars introducing with better milage ok , what about engine , if engine not much good then the car will not stay for long time and gives so many problems in future .in the same way some cars will have some other problems then the cars will not stay for long time and gives the troubles too in the future .only few companies produce every thing perfectly and they stay for long itme in the future .by the above points with for and against i can strongly accept the statement `` after twenty years there will be fewer cars i use than there are today  .
