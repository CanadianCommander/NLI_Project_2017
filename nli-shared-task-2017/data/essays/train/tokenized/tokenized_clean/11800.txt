in the twentieth century advertising has become increasingly important , and it is one of the keys for the success of a commercial product .most of the advertisements , though , try to exaggerate the real features of a product , making it seem much better than it really is .even if of course i ca nt appreciate this behaviour by the advertising companies , i ca nt blame them because if they would tell just the truth they would have to do huge investments to fill the gap between what they used to advertise and what their product really is or they would lose against their concurrents .this would stress also the workers , as they would probably lose their job or get less money than before .the problem is that the global system is now based upon this assumption , and changing this incorrect behaviour would need a global correction of the values of concurrency .but these behaviour is well established and so it s due to the consumer to choose the right products , and not to buy the ones made by companies who just invest in advertising without selling good quality products .there is nothing we can do besides using our freedom of choice in the best way .there is a moment when this behaviour by companies and corporations is nearly criminal and they have to be pursued legally .if a company sells a product that is toxic , unhealthy or if there is a lie in the advertisement , that company has to take its responsability about it in front on a tribunal .for example , i know that sometimes the water that comes from the home sink , that we use and drink every day , is said to be pure in big advertisements around the city .but the laboratory tests have been made in the valley , before the water passes through all the pipes full of rusts in the city .this is an example of a lie told by the state itself .what can a citizen do ?i drink water in bottles , even if i m not sure that my one is etter than the other one .we ca nt be sure about anything regarding what s advertised about commercial products , but it s important to keep our eyes open and try to choose the one we think is the best , maybe helping with our buying power those products that claim themselves to be natural and that do nt do too much advertising .
