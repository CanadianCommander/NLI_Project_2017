a person starts to learn from birth to death .the amount of knowledge changes over time during this life perod .its contents become more spesific and detailed as well .a baby can say limited words until he learn his mother language .therefore , specializing in one subject is in the nature of the human being , so it should be prior to having broad knowledge in a person s life .the school contents are being specialized as the person grows .for instance , in primary school , there is no majors .on the other hand , in high schools or universities , the person chooses his department according to his area of interest .moreover , comparing the bachelor degree , master degree is more spesific on one subject .therefore , specialization is an unevitiable process that we face during our early period of our lives namely the education period .however , after this specialization period of the life , general information becomes more valuable to the person .for instance , a computer engineer works in the programming department of a company until the age of 35 , as a result of the idealistic instinct of human being , he wants to get higher degree in the department .however , an executive master degree in business administration is required for such a position .therefore , the person gets the degree to reach his goal .when the value of specific knowledge decreases , having broad knowledge becomes more valuable .the life periods of specialization and having broad knowledge is in an order which affects the attitudes of human towards the types of knowledge .since i am a student now , it is better to speacialize in one spesific subject , however ; when i become in my thirties , i will probably to get my knowledge broader .
