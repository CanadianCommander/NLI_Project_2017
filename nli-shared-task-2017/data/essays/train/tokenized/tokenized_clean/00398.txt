the car is always been , since the time of its creation , an important mean of transport .while in the past , it was a reserved mean , which was prerogative of the richest part of the population , nowadays it is used by almost the 85 % of the world population the question is : but will it remain a successful mean among twenty years or will be replaced ?or even more , will it disappear ?i think that all depends by the progress of techonology in fact the improvement of the man s style conditions could allow a new born also in mechanic field in fact , the discovering of new electronic elements could bore to a new transportation mean and so render the car useless , but from the other hand this research ca nt never occur if there are nt fund and so money in my opinion , between twenty years , the cars in use will be more than nowadays and not fewer , but they will have almostly , new confort and qualities than the recent one .for example they could have more sophisticated circuit that allow to the driver to orientate whatever is his destination or they would be less polluting than one , perhaps with a non polluted system which convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen preventing all the diseases that characherize the urban citizen but , on the other hand , if there will be more cars , it would create an overcrowding in the street : all the people who have the car in fact use it almost the daytime and with the crowding of the streets. , the man  / women s attitude could change giving origin to some unpleasant events in conclusion , i think that , if in the future , there will be an increasing of the car , which in my opinion will occur , i hope the people learn to use it in a properly way .
