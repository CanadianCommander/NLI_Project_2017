i agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide .last summer i went to itlay with a group and a tour guide , i liked my trip becuse i meet new people form diffrent places and shier same informations .if i did not with the guide i would miss many places in italy .in the same time , i did not konw the history for the places i had visit .two years ago , i went to japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost because , we did not speake thier language and did not know thier transportion system .travel with the group and the tour guide is cheper than trave alone and you cane see more places in limited time .in addation , some trave agents have many tours so , you can select what you like .however , they have programs during the trip to make the travels enjoy they trip .there is bad thing when travel with group , some pepol do not respect the others and make the travelers do not like the trip .but in genral i prefe travel with group and a tour guide .
