the future has always interested human beings , as well as technologies .we happen to wonder about several topics , like guessing if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today or not .we could agree with this statement and think that there will be other ways to move around in the future , but we are not sure of anything for now .this is the reason why i believe in cars rather than in future technoligies , such as flying ships or so .we can evoquate the presence of the train and the plane , which have a rather good success among people nowadays than in the past .this would be a good point , because people take them a lot more than ever .this is due especially to their efficiency and safety .they are faster than a car and safer , for example .some of us might prefer to travel by train or by plane since we do not have to drive or to focus on what is going on , and that we can fit a lot more people in these means of transportations .however , it is rare to arrive exactly where we want to by train or plane .that is , we will still rely on someone to come pick us up at the train station or at the airport .to my mind , i do not think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .indeed , people are buying more and more cars , as in the united states .other countries are beginning to do the same .everytime we need to go somewhere , it is becomimg automatic : we take the car .this is faster and easier for un since we do not have to walk or do some physical activity .human beings are becoming dependant on their cars .this is another reason why i think there will be more cars in use in twenty years .in conclusion , i do not agree with the statement given , but in the pursue of the car industry .the car has become a part of humans  lives ( for most of us ) , therefore i believe it still has good days to come .
