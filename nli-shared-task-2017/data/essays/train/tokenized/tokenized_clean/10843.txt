some people are of the opinion that in general successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well .in my opinion , however , successful people only do what they already know how to do well .this essay will discuss two key reasons to support my statement in more detail below .first of all , i am convinced that in order for people to succeed in their careers , they need to perform what they already know how to do well .the reason is that people make less mistakes by inplementing things based on evidences .for example , as my profession is a cardiac surgery , my boss in the department of cardiac surgery in my hospital always emphasizes that the most important thing for heart surgeon to perform surgery for a patient is to implement a well recognized and scientifically established procedure so as to save as many patient as possible .my boss has now become one of the prestigious , successful cardiac heart surgeons in north america .thus , as a cardiac surgeon , i am always inspired and influenced by his policy , and i do believe that successful peole like my boss try to do what they already how how to do well .second , i am definitely of the opinion that achievable people perform what is widely recognized and approved by everyone because basically when trying new things and taking risks in their life , the success rate is lower than doing what they already know how to well .in the worst senarions , it is probable thta they end up losing their finances and lives if they fail to overcome taking risks .therefore , in order to suceed in their life and professoinal work , it is more appropriate to do what is widely recognized and established .to conclude , i strongly feel that successful people only perform what they already know what to do to avoid making mistakes and causing irreversible results such as financial difficulity and losing their life .
