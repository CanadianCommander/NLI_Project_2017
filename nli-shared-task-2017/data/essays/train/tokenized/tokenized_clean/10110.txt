through today s environment situation , i really hope that there are fewer and fewer cars used in twenty years , because the cars do pollute the air , but i think it may wo nt be true , there will be more cars in use in 20 years .the first reason i want to say is , because of the economics .we know that in indurstry today , a world factury has been built , and as a car , maybe the parts of it come from many country .in 20 years , some country may develop it s economics just by indurstry , and play an important part in the world factury .of course car-making is one of the most important making by the world factury , so the number of cars wo nt decrease .second , as we know that in many countries , cars are vrey popula .in u.s. , for an example , even each family has a car , but we should know that such as us , or germany , all of these countries are developed countries , and there are many developing or iess developed countries , the people in these countries may do want to have a car .i have a chinese friend , he ever told me that , his parents have saved moneny for some years in order to buy a car .so it can easily shows that in some courntries , to have a car is still the persons  in those courntries dream .what s more , as the science developing faster and faster , maybe in 20 years , there will be the car that use electricity to get power , or other things , just in order not to pollute the air , and also maybe there will be the cars that fly in air , drive in the water , just like the car in many movies .so in a word , i think in 20 years , there wo nt be fewer cars in use .in opposite , maybe even more and more cars will be used , of course the cars on that day are clean cars .to say something more , if in 20 years , there are cars just like i mentioned in the article which can drive both in the air and the water , i will book one .
