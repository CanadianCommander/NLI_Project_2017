people are very different from each other .some people have desire and talent to learn and some have different abilities on different subjects .it is like , some can perceive things better but some can not .or some people can jump higher while some can not .these are things about genetics and come with us as we are born .if we look at it that way , we can not say that it is better to study many academic subjects .we also can not say it is necessary to study an academic subject .it is just about people and how their interests and talents direct them .gaining broad knowledge is very important however universities and academics are not the only path necessary reaching it .we can give artists as an example for this .some people still argues about that art can not be teached .some believe it comes inside the artist as they are born .not all the greatest artists in the world are graduated from university .for example leonardo da vinci .he didnt go to any art scool in his life .but some things inside him differenciated him from the rest of the people .we can not say he doesnt have a broad knowledge .example can be widened by athletes .maybe some of them just couldnt graduate from a single academic course but this is because he is not that type of human .he is living in this world to do different things .i am not saying that it is bad or impossible to have broad knowledge on many academic skiss .some people are capable of learning and filling their brains with a lot of information .some may say if is ineffective but i dont think so .one `` can  know a lot .it is just a matter of choice .it doesnt matter which way we choose .the most important thing here is to choose the subject we like and we can .if we are not happy with what we are doing it is impossible for us to be effective in the world no matter how much we know .
