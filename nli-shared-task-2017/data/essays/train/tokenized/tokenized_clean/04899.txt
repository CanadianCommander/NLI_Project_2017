i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .there are three reasons why i choose the idea .first of all , broad knowledge is useful when we have to decide something .it gives us a object point of view , i think .for example , when i was a high school student , i did nt have such broad knowledge that i could not choose to take the course of physics which i really wanted to study and i finally regret my choice before .in fact , i did nt know well what physics is .if i have knowledge about the physics , i difinitely choose the course of physics .threfore , broad knowledge is useful to have a objective point of view .second , broad knowledge helps us to work more fluently .when we work for the company , we face various problems which are difficult to solve .in that case , most of people do nt solve the problem by himself or herself and have a meeting to find a clue to overcome it .it means that various knowlede which belongs to a lot of people is effective to solve the problem .therefore people who have broad knowledge is competent to solve the problem .finally , broad knowlede makes out life more fun .when we talk with the other person , a person with broad knowledge can give a lot of subject to talk and it give people enjoyable time to talk .for instance , i have a friend who have broad knowledge .when i go out for a drink with him in a group , he supplys various topic and most of people concentrate on his talk .thus broad knowledge is efficient to spend enjoyable time with others .for these reasons , i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
