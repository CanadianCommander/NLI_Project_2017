i agree with this statement .if they do not get the main idea and just knowing some facts about it , it would nt be a good thing for the students .for me , at the same time , i was thinking if i agree or disagree with the statement .because , i am in high school freshman year right now .i take ancient history for social studies .first of all , when i just start reading the text book and trying to understand the main ideas about history , i cant get everything in my mind .maybe it is just me but first i always have to get some interesting facts to make myself want to learn about history .right now , i am learing about the crusades .i did nt have any idea what crusades were .so i started reading the text book and trying to get a main idea .but it never made myself want to read farther .i decided to go online and look up for some facts about the crusades .i think it was something like there was this girl who lost her mother when she was small .all she knew about her mother was that she lived in a different country .she knew that the crusades traveled around and spread christianity .although she thought it was going to be hard to find he mother .but she thought it is better than doing nothing .therefore , she decided to spread the christianity with them .i got that fact online and i am not sure if its a true fact but it still made me want to know how the crusades travelled and their where .by getting facts , i got the main idea at the end .but if i get the main idea at first , i think it would of been easier to study later on .so in my opinion , understanding ideas and learing facts are both really important .but ideas are more important for students first .
