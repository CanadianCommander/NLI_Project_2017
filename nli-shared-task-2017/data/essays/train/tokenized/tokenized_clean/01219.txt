i absolutely agree with the statement mentioned .success itself means the accomplishment of a risky or a tough job .people who take the least trodden path , come out with a whole new experience , and more knowledge than the others , who believe in convention and conformity .the whole essence of success , in my perception is achieving something that hasnt been done before .so it is all about doing new things , and doing them well .most successful industrialists , and businessmen in the world are known to have tried and accomplished something new rather than what they are already familiar with and skilled in .larry page tried to design a new kind of search engine , coupled with a wide range of services related to he internet .at first , it was considered to be naive and not much useful .but later on , his creation `` google  became very famous , and is now , unconditionally , the best of it s kind .one more example is the indian businessman dirubai ambani .without people trying out new things , our life wouldnt have been the same as it is now .we wouldnt have had new kinds of clothes , infrastructure and modes of travel .we wouldnt have had new genres of music if musicians of those days didnt try them .rap music , for example , was actually a form of minstrel songs sung by the african americans .but some musicians attempted to commercialize them , with modern context , and they succeeded .risk is another major ingredient of success .it is because of people s positive outlook on risk , that man has achieved a lot in the field of science and technology .today , we have missions going on on other planets , and on space , only because our precursors risked to do something innovative in this field .i finally conclude that , successful people , do take risks and try new things .i even feel that doing something that we are already good at , and that is already tried and done by several others , hardly counts as success .
