in this writting , i am going to discuss an important issue that most of communities faced .the issue is that `` young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communitiea  .this problem occure from different reasons .one strong reson of this problem is that the new developement of technology that take young people time .for example the internet which recover the essential things of a young people and satisfying their needs as young people always concern of how i can happy .most of young people feel happy with their friend as the internet provide them to be with their friends all the time by using the massenger .another point is that as we hear in qatar , the education develope alot .the result of this development the albayan complex school and the independence schools which depend mostly on english languge .to study the english languge in some subjects create some coflict in young people as they do not used to take .this may encourage them to work hard and take english languge courses to improve themselves in english and cope with the development .these take time , so it will not enable young people to be effective and helpful in the community .finally , young people noeaday do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of the pressurs of development and how i can satisfy myselt and be the best .
