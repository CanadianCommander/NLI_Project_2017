`` success follows those who sweati strogly agree with the statement since in life we have to take chances i.e risks .by taking risks it not only increases our confidence level but also give us self satisfaction , acclimation to our actions .for example scientists try to discover new ways or invent the things which works faster , effectively , low cost and higher reliabillity and which out date the present product , so they try new ideas to invent a product which have a high risks , such as marie curie has devoted her life to study the radium and it s patterns with high risk factor .second example is of stunt master who always take risk to make a shot for film , each time he performs new feat with courage and risk and so he is rewarded ,third example is of japan technology since , each person in a firm has his own importance , such as take the manufacturing of television , in this one person manufactures only picture tube and other manufature only the equipment of the television , by continuously manufacturing they innovate new ideas of manufacturing with some bit of risk , because of it their technology is now very advances .in my opinion man has to take risks since after risk it would be definetly success , which follows in one or the another way .a succesful man need not to look for oppurtunities but turn the risks in to oppurtunities .in summary man has to take risks .
