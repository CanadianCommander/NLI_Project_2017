i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are three reasons in my opinion which led to the situation .first , there are too many amusing activities to do .new high-tech toys and recreations are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stick on those things .big companies uses strong advertisement and free trails to make sure the potential consumers will not do anything else but spending time on the products .moreover , interacting with friends takes most of young people s time .all of these activities occupied every minute of them .second , the education from young people s parents does not give them the idea .to live in a competetive world , children are taught to learn knowledges as much as they can and give attention to other things as less as they can .cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around .they are told to keep their hands from things that are helpless to their grades .due to this twisted concept , young people are not interested in communities activities .third , the media broadcasts negative examples which stop young people from taking action .people refuse to give time helping their communities because of bad news .a crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help .teenagers can be in trouble because their lack of experience on helping the communities .above all , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .by observing those who live around , we can find out that young people will help if the negative conditions are removed .creating a nice and friendly environment for teenagers to open their mind will be the best way to let them give more time on communities activities .
