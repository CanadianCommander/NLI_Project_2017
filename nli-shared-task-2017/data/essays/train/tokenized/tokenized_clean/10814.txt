first of all , knowledge is like a diamond something very expensive and you are proud to have and without knowledge you ll be out of the whole world , and no body has doubt with this .beeing specialized in on e specific subject does nt mean that you are going to ignore the other parts of knowledge which may be sometimes more important to know .the advantages of beeing specialist in on part of the life sience is that you will concentrate on what you are doing and this will lead a person to be creative in his work and to live with an ambition that will lead him to fight to achive his desired goals in that field .now days the community needs those specialists because of thier good experiences and thoughts about what they are doing in thier majors , for examples , the home designers , film directors , photographers , engineers and others all of these are specialists and imagine a community without them .even though the companies , they are paying alot for those people who are talented in thier majors to do thier job completed in an aacurate and efficient waysknowledge about other things is a must and life requires that must .so i agree that the person should cocentrate on his field first and then he should know some part of knowledges that he needs , to improve his life and to be able to comunicate with other knowledges and to learn from them what they know .the community will never be improved or developed if there is no specialists , and cultures will not be formed if there is no specialists where every person is doing his job to form a beautiful culture finally at the end .
