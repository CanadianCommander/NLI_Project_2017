in our society advertising has become the morst important aspect of business .anywhere you go , it is possible to find any kind of advertisements that try to convince you to buy anyhting .one one side of the street you see that the cheese produced by x is the most delicius and soft you would ever taste .the advertisement would be for sure full of colour and happy people on it .on the other side you might find another advertisement about the cheese produced by y , and may be the colour of the poster are less bright than the other , and the people are less actractive .so you decide to buy the chees from the company x , but once you open it and you eat a piece of it , it is disgusting and not soft at all .obviously you get disappointed : it was not what you were expecting .but the envelope was very nice and colourful .some times advertisements promise you miracle :  buy this wash machine !all your shirts will be perfectly white , even if your child put chocolate and grass on it !you will not have to spend time in ironing , because the washmachine will do it for you !so you spend a fortune to buy something that theoretically should make your life easier , but unfortunately you will soon find out that these were just words .most probably you will have to buy a new stock of t-shirts for your child and spend a lot of time ironing all the cloths .we know that advertisements make products to seem much better than what they really are , but most probably we want to believe them becasue we would like to have an easier life , less frenetic and dreamfull .different companies , same product : they have to attract as many costumers as possible if they want to survive in the jungle of business , so they obviously have to exagerate the qualities of their products .we can not blame them too much , we just have to be careful when we decide to buy something and not choose and item only according to its envelope .
