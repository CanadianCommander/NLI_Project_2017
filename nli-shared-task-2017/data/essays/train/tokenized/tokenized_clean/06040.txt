eventhough , learning facts is important to pass exam or know knowledges , understanding basic ideas and concepts are very more important for learnig something .many subjects have their own basic ideas and concept .for exsample , learning the histories , there are a lot af fact in the past .many students studies events for their studies , however , only few students think about why the events are occured .learning and findind out the reason of events is very helpful to know history deeply .not only history and but also math requires to know concept of process .maybe it is not inpossible to pass exam with only facts .students should know the concepta od process to prove the answer .understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students for make their own decision or studies .if students learn only facts , it is hard for them to know what the facts  purpose .they can not find out what they learned exsectly .in my country , middle school and high school students usually learn facts without ideas and concepts because passing exam is vety important for their life .however , when they imigrantto the other counties espacially the unites state , they feel hard to study because they do not know the real purpose .also , learning ideas and concept help making desicion because set up the ideas and condept help lead to process and reach a goal and facts .in art classes , many teachers teach students to explain their are work because final works are not important and it can not be good art work without thinking , ideas and concept .in summary , i think learning ideas and concept are more important to learning fact .most of facts of subject composed of their own ideas and concepts so knowing these are basic to know facts .
