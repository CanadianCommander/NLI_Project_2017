there are several ways of travelling to many different kinds of destinations .people could travell in groups lead by tour guides , by themselves , with a partner .i believe that the best way to travell varyes completely on the destination of the trip .if a american does not know how to speak japanesse is taking a trip to japan , it would not be advisable for him to go by himself .in that situation i would much rather prefer to travell in a group with a tour guide who obviously speaks japanesse .another case scenario would be an american person travelling to hawaii were its languaje is spoken .of course it would not hurt to have a tour guide who knows the place to show this person around but if the purpose of the trip is heading to the beach to relax and enjoy , no tour guide should be necessary .i would travell with someone other than a tour guide .in conclusion , i do not fully desagree with the statement nor fully agree with it .i firmly believe that the best way to travell depends on the destination and the circumstances of the trip .
