yes , i agree with the statement that young people are not showing up intrests in helping the communities rather most of them are intrested in other useless activities as far as concerned .many communities need helping hands to cover their problems .young people should be their icons , but unfortunately they are not , added to that they take up a large participation in damaging those legal communities .for example , their are many communities for old-age people , they are forced to live up in boundage houses wheir they lack their family sentiments though their children are financially sound .most of them feel it to be a burden to look after them and to get relieved from this they , force the aged people to live apart .young people now-a days are more attracted towards the external affairs they are not supposed to be .they are not sparing up their time to help the communities even in their liesure time rather they are attracted towards the entertainment section like movies , clubs etc.they dont even have time to spend on the communitie in which they live , they simply try up to escape from it as much as possible .i think they shoud to be focused to the advantages and satisfaction they get when they help the communities .the abase response to this , should be shown to them theoritically .the matured quality in such matters shoud be inheritted into them .young people , these days are misleaded about the importance of the communities and their uses .communities accumulate forms the nation .they are a pride factor for resemblence .finally , i conclude that young people should always approach the communities in a possitive way and help the communities as far as they can .helping the communities tend to help themselves in all
