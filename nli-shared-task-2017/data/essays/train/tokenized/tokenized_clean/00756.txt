i think that the car has changed the life of the last century and it is an impotant mean for our life still today .however i think also that the cars bring with them same ambiental and social problem .first of all , the cars make too pollution , also new cars that they have so many reststriction but again today is not enough .furthermore , the cars have destroed all kind of human ralationshipm whit nature and otherelf .for example , for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters , because , so they do less work .the people do nt want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving .this abuse of the car is allowed becouse not only for the laize of the people but also for the bad condition of pubblic traspot .indeed , in some part of the world , it is always late , durty , and sometimes very expencive , and above all confortless .in other words , these are situations that force people to take the car .indeed , it has all confort that we want : air conditioned , music , space . ..i do nt belive that among twenty years the car will be fewer , instead i think that the number will grow up more and more .this will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( i am talking about my particular country situation ) .nothing is doing to change direction .on the other hand , somebody thinks that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car , but for my it is not true , for to topic : the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars  factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life .iin conclusion i think that the solution are two or the goverment of all wor
