i do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .in todays fast going society , where time is money and every one is over acheiving , there is little time which a young person can devote to the commnunity .but with in this small amount of time which is available , todays youth is contributing much in terms of quality of help as well as quantitythere are numerous ways in which this can be shown .90 percent of the young men and women whom you meet today are having hearty ambitions and very defined carrer goals .most young women today aspire to be dynamic executives rather than being just a home maker mom .these healthy ambitions in them selves are a great contribution to human society , making the society progressive and dynamic .the vitality of society brings about the much nourishment which is required for the charity organizations .a goal driven youth is much more likely to be a benefactor to a poor child or a good social worker , as part of service which is required for obtaining a place in prestigious educational institutes .today s aspring youth are tomorrow s benefactors of society for a given certainity , as they drive the economy in full speedanother example of youth contribution to society is evident in increased entreprenuership , in sectors of environment protection , waste recycling and alternative energy production , by young entreprenuers through out the worlda teenager who earns pocket money or money for tution fee through baby sitting or service in a old age home is an excellent example of a young person who is serving the society as well as his or her own needs .a student who organizes a student body or writes a web log to help other students from his nation to study internationally and earn prestigious honors is an excellent example of a young person , trying to develop his fellow students .in a place like india , where government can not provide adequate social security , recently i read of 2 young sisters , who have organized a rehabilitation center for mentally retarded or dsiturbed women who roam in streets , with out nobody to take care of them .i personally know some of my young friends who sponsor poor children annually , almost anonymouslyi would like to conclude that todays youth is responsible , goal driven and service oriented .they are giving back to their communities and are role models for coming generations
