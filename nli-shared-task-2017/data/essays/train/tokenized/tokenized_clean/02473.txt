young people nowadays do not give anough time to helping their communities .i agree with this statement in all totality .the scenario is reflected in the world today .how many people do you see picking up litter ?how many people do you see helping the proverbial old lady across the street ?a community comprises of like-minded people constantly interacting with each other .it needs caring , grooming and regular maintainence which can only be achieved by devoting time to it .young people have to divert time to step out and help their community .in today s competitive world , everybody watches his own .in the race to success , people have become too busy digging for gold in their own backyard than stepping out and helping a neighbour mow his lawn , or maybe participate in a neighbourhood charity .in a study , it turns out that the number of students appearing for government positions are steadily decreasing .this is a striking contrast to the yester-years when young people were proud joining the social service for the betterment of their community .a community is a powerhouse of moral values and improvement of quality of life .a considerable amount of time has to be invested in it to provide fruitfull results .young people have to nurture the community and make it a better place for children and future members .young people have to realize that their community is analogous to their family .just as spending time with family improves the quality of life at home , similarly spending time in your community improves the quality of life outside .a place where we watch each other s back and help out in times of need is the place we have to strive for .there will be no transition when we step out of our doors and only young people can make it happen .
