there are some people who voice serious doubts about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and who are prepared to argue with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but i would have to say that if i faced with the decision , my choice will be for having broad knowledge of many academic subject .first reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is knowing many things with this way .if we know somethings about many academic subjects , we can effect people while we are searching job .for instance , there is a man who graduated from university and who is searching job for the money but he only specialize in one specific subject before the his business life .i think he can not be sucessful in his career because of this .on the other hand , there is a man who know something about many subjects .this man easily can effect the people who are manage the company so he can easily find the job for working and he can earn good money in his business life .another reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that i think the knowing many things is symbol of the evolotion .if the country have people who know something about many subjects , this country can easily develop in all ways so knowing many things is also useful for our country .one the other hand , counry which have people who specialize in one one subject can not develop easily .all in all from what has been mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject .
