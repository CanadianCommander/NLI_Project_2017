in my opinion , understanding is the key to the educational process .while teaching , a professor not only transmits his knowledge to students , but he also gives them the keys to comprehension .the most important point is not what we learn , but how we learn .for example , education system deeply changed during past years .if we take the time to ask our parents how was school when they were kids , we would probably be astonished by their answer .indeed , they were used to learn their lessons by heart , and this was a very mechanical exercise .sometimes they did not even know what they were talking about !education system realized its mistake , and changed its technique .nowadays , an important role is given to interaction .indeed , students have now the possibility to ask questions .the answers they would get would help them in easily understanding the topic they are discussing .as they get the meaning of an idea , a concept , they remember it in a better way .moreover , this interaction between students and professors allow them to show their interest in some topic .they are not passively listening , they can bring their opinion , their ideas .this can lead to new issues , and open their minds .a concept can be spread from one to another , illustrating the very basis of development .the thing not only about knowledge , moreover about reflexion .school teaches the power of thinking by ourselves .as the students understand ideas , they learn facts , whereas the opposite does not work .
