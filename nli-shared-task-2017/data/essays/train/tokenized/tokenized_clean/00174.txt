for old people , they have experienced all kinds of events , delightful or frustrating , so the life has already been a past process .in my opinion , what they should do is to review if and gain satisfactory from it instead of looking forward .i definitely agree with this statement and below i would explain some of the reasons .every day , every hour , and even every minute , we , especially the young people , face a lot of problems either in work or at home .since the world is rapidly changing and modern life has became more and more complicated , there are a lot of pressures , also can be called pleasures , modern people can enjoy .obviously , old people can not catch this rapid social pace , it also implies that these great pleasure resulting from works or compete are more and more far away from the old people .internet , invented in last century , with its wide availabity and increasingly prosperous information supplies , has become one of the most powerful means of both communication and pastimes today in the history , and will be more and more difficult to ignore .as it is so fashional that its user has been basically limited to the young people .yong people has active thoughts and strong curiosities .these are essetial traits for enjoying the life .take the case of a thing that one of my neighbor family , having both a teenager member and a grandfather .the boy are proficient in almost all kinds of modern facilities and seems to be obsessed with them .while the grandfather , with a priority to these machines , but seldom to touch them .the only entertaiment he enjoys was the boring radio .in brief , young people is just on the arising phase of their lifes , and it is the right time for them to enjoy the life which is still somewhat mysterious .
