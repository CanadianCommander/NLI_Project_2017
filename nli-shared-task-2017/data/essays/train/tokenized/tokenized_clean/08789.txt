the given statement sounds to me as it implements that young people have better things do than to spend time with their communities .in general i agree with the given statement .as far as i know it was more common to help in the community a century ago .the society structure those days was different then today .not only that the number of inhabitants rised with the time and we have much bigger communities today , also people mostly live in big cities now and not in small communities like then .at the same time the structure of the communities changed .nowadays the work which was done in a community many years ago is done by other institutions now .the state is much more responsible in welfare-questions or questions concearning social security in recent years .when communities were smaller , people helped themselves out in times when someone was sick , or needed help because he or she was old or could not work anymore .today , i think , people and especially young people are very concerned about their own life .time is rare , at least for people that have a job and  or a family .they need their time to manage their hoseholds .but if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determine by themselves , i am sure they use it for their own amusement , for cultur , fun , sports or just to spend the time with their friends and family .i do nt know anyone out of my group of friends who is somehow involved with community-work .neighther am i .the reason for this is for sure the change in society and also in social values .the interrests changed as well .one reason people are less interrested in politics , social life or in their own communities might be the increasing anonymity in society .so many people live on a very small area and do nt know each other .no wonder that they do not even care for each other anymore .
