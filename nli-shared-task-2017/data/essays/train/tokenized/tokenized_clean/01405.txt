i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .people usually buy for looking the products which have good looking shape .the customers can not test the products before using it except special events , so the people who make the advertisements pay attention about making good and charming advertisements .these are the specific reasons what i agree with the statementfirst , customers want to be a model who shows in the advertisement .everybody wants to be a nice guy or a beautiful woman instead of being ugly people .as a result , the people who make the advertisesements make this kind of advertisements .for example , if the tv shows very charming hair shampoo advertisement , the model in the advertisement has very beautiful blond straight hair , it blows by the wind and it looks really nice .if i have think , curly black hair , i can not be as a woman who are in the advertisement .second , customers do not know its value exactly .just to see an advertisement , the customers never know about its value , since they never tried it before .even if the product has very poor value , the customers never know about it before using it .so , the people who make the advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .third , customers easily lose their sights about judging the advertisement .while they are watching the advertisements , they easily lose their minds which they already know about the fake of the advertisements .because of this reason , the workers who work for the advertisement company are trying to make the products seem much better that they really are .for these reasons ; people want to be a cool person , people do not know the product s value , and people can easily lose their sight about the capacity to judge the advertisements , we should think about the advertisements .people should aware to watching the advertisements and think again about the products that the people are willing to buy .
