in this essay , i will discuss , whether it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , or to favor specialization .to my mind , specializing in one subject is an old-fashioned way of thinking and is not favorable nowadays .the main reason for that is the job situation of our modern society .in the generation of my parents it was common to study one topic , then get a job and being working in this job for their whole working life .today , things have changed .mostly because of economical means , the job situation is not that reliable as is once was .in the last decades , the frequency of hiring and firing employees has increased and is still increasing .the consequence of this development is that people often have to change jobs .the only way of surviving in this new circumstances is to be as flexible as one can be .if you now choose one special field to study , there will be no guarantee for you to find a job in this sector , especially not for your whole working life .only if you are planning to do research after having finished your studies it might make sense to concentrate on a specific topic .to find new ideas and to really change the world you can not study every possible subject in detail , because it is neither efficient nor manageable .but this is definitly not the most common case .and of course do companies like employees who are very well trained , but for you yourself it is important to remain flexible and to be able to learn new things , which will be necessary in the future working life .studying should be a preparation for your life and the only way to accomodate your studies to the modern job situation is to do your studies with wide-spread interest .
