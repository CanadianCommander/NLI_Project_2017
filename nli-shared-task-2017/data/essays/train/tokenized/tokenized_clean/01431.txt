the issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in my opinion , i believe that it is better for students to know broad knowledge .there are three reasons why i think that .first of all , it will be very boring to study one subject for a long time .in fact , you might get totally exausted and you might even lose the interest in that subject .for example , students who are good at calcualtion study math for a long time would also want to change the studying subject to a subject that can read without using your hands or brain .secondly , you can know what you are really interest in when you study a bit of various subjects .this is the reason why educations do nt focus on a specific subject and it also can make up the choice which what we really like of a student after a long time basic education till high school .for example , we decide what major we want to study after entering universities .we can decide by the interest we developed since we started elementary school .futhermore , i believe with the advantage of learning everying a bit give more opportunities of choosing various job .we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply jobs we want in the future .for example , people who want to study hotel management when they apply to thier universities .people who put hotel management as their major need to lean a lot of things than just management .as far as i know , they need to know about different kind of wines , business , economy and communication among people .in conclusion , i prefer that people should learn more than just a subject .
