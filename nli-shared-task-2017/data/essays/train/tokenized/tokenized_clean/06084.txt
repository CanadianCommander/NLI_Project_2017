actually i m agree with the statment beaucause when everybody travel with nothing so much people gonna say do this or do that , it s gonna make you a litltle confuse , they can even make you go to the wrong way .when you travel along with nobody i ca nt even tell how bored it s gonna be .if the travel is five hours it s gonna be worst then everything .that s why when you go in group led its much better by your self and it s more secure too .you could also find a lot a fun by chatting each other , you gonna have a lot of occupation to do and that s for sure itt a lot of fun , no need to think where you goind , which way to go .if you and your group travel at the same time you making some joke , you not even see when you arrive in the destination place .me i love traveling specially with my family far away .one day my decide to make a trip all away to canada and the whole family was included in this trip , i think it was like five seven hours driving , that s was very fun .every two hours my dad stop the car , so we could get something to eat and it s was a very nice journey .every body in the car was happy about this trip .one day i whish i coold do that again and i hope i gonna be the same fun .that why i agree with the following statement .
