some people prefer to arrange a travel by themselves , while others like to join a group led by a tour guide .i am incline to the later way , becuase a tour guide provides many advantages to me .first of all , i like to visit a place that i have never been there before .it will cost a lot of time and energy to arrange a travel .people have to fingure out how to get to the place they want to , the transportation tools and fairs .although , the e-business system provides many ways to book air tickets , hotels , and other necessary facters to modern travelers , it still costs time .after experience stressful time in workplace , many people do not want to spend a lot of time on exploring tickets on the internet .a tour guide arranges every thing of the travel for the members of group .people just pick up a travel agency , select a travel package , and then pay money .they will reveive a document which describes the detailed arrangement about this tour .second , a tour guide knows more about the place than anyone else in his group , because he is professional agency .he has led a travel group from many times before take you to the place .he is trained to know everything for that place .he can intruduce the history of an ancient building in a vivid way , and tell travelors many intestresing stories that can not be found in a tour guide book .he learn where is the most valuable place that people can not miss , hence a tour guide can make a proper schedule and spare enough time for that stop .he also watch the time and takes care of transportation ; therefore , people do not need to look at the train schedule time and time again to make sure that they could catch an right train .finally , joining a group led by a tour guide is a way to make friends in travel .a travel group consiste of people with vary backgrounds .to talk to unknown people in one s group allows people to learn many intestresing thing that they can not know if they travel alone .in conclusion , i believe that join a travel group led by a tour guide is a better way than travel alone because it easy , cost saving , and more fun .
