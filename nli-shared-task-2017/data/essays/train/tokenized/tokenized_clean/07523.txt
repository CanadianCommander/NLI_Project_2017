i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for example , my family had a apple tree in our backyard .when we get the apple from the tree the apple had worse looking than from a store .another example is i have heard that a company for selling foods , which are manto and dimsom , made the foods just good taste and good-looking , but not good for health .first , when i was in my elementary school in korea , my family had a apple tree in our backyard of my apartment .we never gave it any chemical pesticide or never do advertisements .after i graduated from the elementary school , my family and i could get nine apples from the tree .three of them were already eaten by insects , so we could nt eat the tree of them ; however , others were fine , but it looked really worse than the apples in a fruits store .even if the taste of my apples was better than of the store s apples , i felt my apple s taste is worse because the appearance of my apples made the apple had bad taste .second , i have seen that a company for selling foods , manto , dimsom , or etc. , made the food by the wasted trashes from restourants in the news .when they made it had a good-looking , they did advertisements , also they put some chemical materials to make it has good teste .so , the food from the company had really good taste and good looking , but extremly bad for one s health .there are still some companies like that in korea .even though the food is not already eatable , the advertisments make it eatable .for that reason , i agree that advertisements make products seem better .because of my expriences , the apple tree and news about ` trash food ,  i agree that the most advericements make products seem much better thatn they really are .but , i also think the advertisements is necessary because i make the food taste better by giving good appearace .
