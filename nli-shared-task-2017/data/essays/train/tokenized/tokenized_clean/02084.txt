nowadays , there are many kinds of transportation for mankind .trains , bicycles , motocycles , airplanes . ..etc. and most common method of transportation above all is car .nowadays , almost each one of us has at least one car which he or she possesses .and as the population increases on and on , the number of cars in use would increase on and on .but due to the development of technology in our world , and growing awareness of people towards the environment they live in , i believe that in twenty years of time , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .firstly , cars have contributed to lots of pollution going on around our world .people are agressive beings .they will try to eliminate all the factors that can pose threat to their lives .so , if cars give off too much pollutants to the environment people are living in , people will try to find a substitute for cars in future .secondly , people are becoming more concerned about their health and the environment around them than they used to be in the past .now , after having put lots of damages to the environment , people are trying to conserve the environment again and trying to find a way to get rid of the pollutions they have created .that s why people are trying to use more environmental friendly method of transportations and use public transportations to reduce the pollution going on .if this trend continues on , in twenty years time , less people will use cars as their main source of transportation and try to find another solution and use less cars in the future .thirdly , the reason why people use cars is to be more convenient when they are moving .driving cars is more convenient than walking , running , or driving a horse .people have developed many ways to make these improvements during the past .mankind have made an enormous development in the past history .as the time goes on and on , people will try to invent a new way of transportation which will make them more convenient and less time taking than now .even now , airplane has been invented and is becoming more popular than it used to be in the past becuase it is less time consuming and more comfortable than a car .so , with regards to this characteristic of mankind , there is no reason why people will not invent a new method of transportation and abandon using cars as their main method of transportation .the aggressive nature of human beings , growing awareness of importance of natural environment , and development of technologies to meet people s desires to live a more convenient and less time consuming life will probably reduce the numer of cars used in twenty years from now .people are always trying to make improvements in their lives .so , if they are more concerned with having a better life than they have now , they will try to find a way to do so under any circumstances .
