there are several reasons why i agree with the proposed statement .first of all , because the ability to understand the esence of the information provided in school will give the student the possibility to apply that knowledge to as many situations as they have to face in the future .meanwhile , knowing facts will just provide them a mountaion of rarely useful information .in fact , the comprehension of the ideas and concepts should be teachers  primary concern .learning facts can be useful for life , but much greater is the importance of understanding of why those facts happened .during the practice of my profession i can remember a large number of opportunities in which i took the examples and explanations given by university professors .even when at the moment of learning the i did nt give them the importance that they deserved , eventually they turned out to be valuable asset for my career .probably , that is why some good advice will never be fogotten and will possibly be applied to many up coming experiences and situations .personally , i find very difficult finding the esence of things .mostly i chose the wrong way to solve problems of my life and profession .actually , that can be the main reason why i have nt gotten to the top yet .usually the most important leader are those that possess bright minds , so bright that they get to see things in a different way the normal people do .in other words , they are able to see the most important aspect of the issue they are facing , while the rest of the people just get to see matter that surrounds the most importan point .i think that i will probably spend the rest of my days trying to understand the ideas and concepts with which i have to deal in both , my life and my career .in short , i will always recommend young students to learn and understand the concepts and ideas they have to study , otherwise they will have just a great amount of useless information .
