i disagree with the statement .i traveled around canada by myself .it was a bus travel for a month .it was a great experience for me .i had a lot of chance to talk local people .i could go whereever i wanted to go .at the begining of the trip , i was nervouse about travering alone .because i had never traveled alone even in japan and i did not have much information about citys where i would go .of course , i did not have any friends there .however , after a few days i became not feel lonly at all .i met and talked a lot of people .i was not alon at all .i had to ask people where i was on a map or how to get a hotel which i would stay the night .and also many people talked me where i would go or where i am from .eveyone who i talked were very kind to me .some of them drove me around their home town for me .they were real tour guides .they knew very well about their home town and i could tast their real life style .i remember nice people more than beautiful buildings .a town looks more beautiful when people who live there are nice .at a famouse spot , usually there are some tours which provied by local government or an organisation .they are good enough to get the information about the spot .when we travel with a group , we tend to talk the member of the group all the trip and we do not have time to talk with local people , which miss wonderful part of a trip .when we travel alone , we have to take a responsivirity for everything by ourselves , so we become more careful .of couse , we have to make sure not to go around at night , to have our passport all the time and so on .from my experience , i think that we can feel a town more close , when we travel alone .so i disagree with the statement .
