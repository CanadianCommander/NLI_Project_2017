people born , live , and die .this is the typical cycle of human life .in this cycle the people choose the way of their lives individually .some people prefers an enjoyful life , such as entertaining , travelling doing thing they enjoyed , while the others prefer working for their future .but it shouldt be understood that people who are working do nt enjoy the life .from this phenomenia the topic comes to the question of how can people enjoy life and who can enjoy life more .in the answers of this question generally it is encountered the statement of young people enjoy life more than older people do .this statement makes a categorization of people by their ages .but i do nt agree with this statement .it is right that young people have more physical abilities to the older people .but it should nt be understood that only the physical abilities are enough to enjoy life .young people has more physical abilities , but their decision abilities are nt grown up enough to make always the right decisions on the situations they encountered .for this reason they can fail while they are trying to enjoy .it is also generally thought that older people are working and do nt have enough time to make different things which would be enjoyful .but it should also be considered that working on the job which is your ideal would be the most enjoyful activity for you .working , improving or inventing new devices , generating new ideas , dealing with your own interests also can make your life enjoyful .finally , my last opinions on this statement is that the life would be enjoyful if you are on the way of your preferences .if you are doing the things in your dreams , and on the place where you wanted to be the lifge would be enjoyful for you .so , from that time the ages does nt affect your considerations about the life .
