`` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i disagree with this statement becasue this is a statistic based statement .this is just a general idea that somebody has put forth which does not necessarily need to be true .my opinion is that people can be sucessful only when they work hard and do what they are good at .people who know their work are better able to succeed that the people who do not know the material .people who have a university or college degree on a particular area of expertise have a better chance to succeed in life than the people who have not obtained that certain degree .of course , there will be few people who want to try the material , but becasue they are just trying new things does not mean that they will become better than the people who already know the material .taking risks and trying new things does not mean that they are going to turn out better than what you are already do .suppose there is an art major who wants to `` try new things  in buisness .due to the fact that she is an art major , he or she would have to start from the bottom and work their way up .it would be harder for them to cope in the buisness career .they may be able to succeed , but they will not be able to give their maximum potential .they would give their maximum potential in art .therefore , the person would have a greater chance of having a career in art rather than buisness .you can try new things and if you are able to cope up with the work load and if you are able to understand the material , you may become successful .the chances are , however , that you would be able to succeed in what you do best .trying new things is not a bad idea , but it would not take place of what you originally do best .
