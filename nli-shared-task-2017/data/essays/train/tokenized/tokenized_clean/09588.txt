the issue given at the hand is the usage of cars in the coming years .this issue is difficult as i have to present the various thoughts in this regard .i think that the usage of cars in the next 20 years is going to increase for the reasons that i am going to mention now .the first reason that i think that people would use more cars because the people in the developing countries are more focused on their travelling modes and are concerned about the comfort that using a personal vehicle can have .this is suggested by the fact that the number to car manufacturers are growing world - wide and that the customers are regularly offered cars a relatively low prices to encourage their sales .even new designs have appeared and people are mad after the latest model car available in the market .secondly , owing a car is considered as a symbol of prestige and is no longer restricted to high - income earning people .any person who owns a two wheeler would dream to buy a car in near future and considering the population of average earning group world wide this claearly indicates that their wil be an increase in the usage of cars .this is human nature to long for more sophisticated things and car is just one of them .even the point that the entire family can travel comfortably in one car can not be ruled out .thirdly , even if the traffic problem is considered , many developing countries are now building fly-overs , bridges and other architectural constructions keeping in mind the increase in the traffic in near future .considering the design features many cars are now designed to be smaller so that they can fit in the most crowded road very easily .even the parking problem is solved using magnificient structures that allow many vehicles to be parked at a single place which is usually underground .so even the government is expecting the increase in the use of four wheeler .fourth reason that can be given is the development of new technology that ensures reduction in the fuel required , even the use of cng can be considered which guarantees no pollution , increase in the performance of the vehicle and hence overall contributon to reducing the environmental pollution , which is usually bought in these cases , contribute to the increase in the number of car owners .for all the reasons-peoples attitude , traffic problem which can be solved , car manufacturer new designs and efforts in reducing the environmental pollution - i have mentioned above i think that the number of car owners are going to increase in the next twenty years .
