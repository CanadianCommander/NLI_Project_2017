for some people , you will suceed in your life just by taking risks .and it is right , in a certain way .in fact , our society shows admiration for these kinf of people .but we have to go deeply in this field to demostrate another side of this way if living .first of all , let us consider in which way taking risk could be a good strategy .if you are used to take risks by trying new things , you will become more and more famous .in that respect , our society are prouded of these behaviours of sorts .for example , you do nt have passed your exams when you were young .but you succeed in building your own business .then , journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take .thanks to these articles , you will become famous .due to these sides , this strategy seems very attractive .but , some people , in order to become more and more famous , will take too much risks .people who adopt this strategy have to be very carreful .on the other and , we trend to forget negative sides of this strategy .actually , if you take risk to succeed in your life , it would induce issues such as financial issues .for instance , you own a shop .you have to finance this shop , by getting a lot of money on it .if this shop does nt work in the long run , you would have debts .it may lead to financial issues with your bank .according to me , it is a lack of consciousness , especially when you are in charge of a family .this argument is far from being useless .when you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life , you must be awared of this .to sum up , i ca nt help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy .as far as i am concerned , i am convinced that some people should try this strategy because of their nature .the others sould carry on their habits of living .
