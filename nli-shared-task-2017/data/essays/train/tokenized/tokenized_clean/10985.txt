i agree with this statement that the cars now are used more than last and with big numbers .in addition , the resources of energy play an important role in my decision and affect the existance of large number of cars in the last twenty years .in the begining , we have to know that the resources of energy have been developed through the last decades .first , people relied on themselves in transportations then they began to depend on animals like hourses and camels .then more resources began to appear like the resource of the steam energy which could be developed after the appearance of the cook .then the development continued until the finding of the petrolum .then the activity of this type spreads alot and continues till now in its growthing .the oil ( a part of the petrolum components ) drived alot of fields in the improving and developing of cars  invention .the manufacturing process of cars are now one of the biggest industries in the world .that the oil become availabe in many countries and there is a good reserve for it .also , the iron factories which become more advanced and has the ability of providing large amounts of it for the process .indeed , the high technology that appeared in the recent years in the field of improving the characteristics of materials used in the industrial which helps to invent new ones which can bear the impacts well and have small weight .in fact , this process are in conjuction with development of materials in the industry that it made the reducing of impairments in many materials increasing their quality and decreasing their costs .these factors affected the manufacturing process of cars and lead to have a lot of cars and with differents technologies and models .also , the cars available now have a high range of costs which are suitable to many people to have one of them .finally , we see the development happened to the energy resources and the appearance of a new one by the petrolum .this new type affects the manufacturing of cars since it is available in many places and with large amounts .also , the enhancements happened for the manufacturing of iron and the charactersitcs of materials used in the body of cars .also , we see the effect which leads to have a lot of cars with considerable costs so many people could have and then the number of cars increased .
