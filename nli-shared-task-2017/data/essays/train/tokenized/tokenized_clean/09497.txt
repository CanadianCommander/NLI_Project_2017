my grandfather was 90 years old when he passed away .while his life had ended , mine still continued .however , i could in no way say that he did not enjoy life .he was one of the most charismatic people i ever knew and if someone had had any experience about life , it was him .one has to admit that younger people are able to move much faster , and learn much faster , but the truth of the matter is that older people have already learned their lessons , and thus are more able to enjoy life .nowadays , youth has the possibility of using technology , which has made life so much more fun , and provided various ways of entertainment such as movies or the internet .also , the fact that we are young in the 21st century allows us to experience much more than our elders experiences during their youth .as i was telling my friend mike the other day , there is no way enjoy life without youth .precisely the fact that we have not learned our lessons yet , opens up the possibility of discovering new worlds and having new experiences , which our elders simply do nt have at the moment .while youth does have the added bonus of more time left , older people have the added bonus of their experience .with time , a person can learn to do new things , find new things , which will simply benefit his or her life .for example , the fact that my dad has travelled to paris and knows all the good places there allows him to visit them again and again , something a young person with no travelling experience will not be able to do .also , an older person is more likely not to depend on someone economically or legally , which allows them to be freer , than their counterparts : the young people .in conclusion , i would say that while older people are maybe not as capable of moving as fast as younger people , age does not prevent anyone from enjoying life to the maximum point .i will always remember my grandfather , anxious to show his experiences and colorful life to his nieces and nephews while continuing to live his live to the fullest .
