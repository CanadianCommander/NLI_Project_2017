it is admitted that the optimization of already-gained competences lead to success .there is indeed a high degree of certainty to reach goals , achievement when using means that are already familiar and well controlled .however , to me taking risks is a derterminant or aggregate to feeling and being more sucessful .i would even say that to me it represents the extra-mile .from a personal experience , i was quite successful studying in france , in my mother-tong french .after a pre-degree i decided to take a major risk and instead of going abroad to pursue my studies for just one semester ( as the big majority of students does ) , i opted for dual-degree program , where classes until the bachelor degree were delivered in german .at the time , my knowledge of german were not the best ever and it was difficult to follow in class .however , i gave myslef time to adapt , i worked hard enough , and after two years , i am fluent .it was a major risks , to compromete my good grades .indeed it was logical that i would probably not achieve the same level of grades as in france .this was in fact a big deal , since i was planning on integrating school for masters , which for the selection require high grades .after weighting the pros ans the cons , on a long-term i came to the conclusion that this risk-taking experience had been one of the best decisions i ever made .i must insist on the fact , that at the beginning it had not been easy .however , through this experience , i had the opportunity to adapt to a unknown environment , culture and society , to learn i language and to improve my intercultural and interpersonal communication skills .i soon realized then that having taken that risk had entirely been worthwhile .aaaas sucess i integrasted big
