some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject .as for me , i would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only .though there are a variety of subjects in a university for you to follow with .but a single man s energy and time are so limited that you ca nt afford wasting too much time on subjects that has nothing to do with your future career .imagine a freshman majoring physics with a selection of english literature in hand all day around , will he succeed in his field someday ?hardly .furthermore , we call these `` academic subjects  because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school .they are far more complex and complicated .you ca nt expect to manage it within a semester or two .it needs a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level of certain field .some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because an affection on the spur of the moment , as soon as he realizes that he wo nt be able to catch up with the course whatsoever , he will just simply drop halfway .finally , having a determination in specializing a single subject is a crucial step on your way of self-realization .anybody who wants to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise .michael jordan may be a good example .as soon as he decided to become a professional basketball player , he devoted all himself to the basketball court , without thinking other alternatives .he set his goal and went for it !in conclusion , specializing in a single subject rather than pursuing many academic subjects will be a wise choice .focusing your energy and time into the subject , accumulating knowledge from that field and set your future goal firmly without doubt , it will lead you to the road of glory !
