young people enjoy a life more than the older people do .i dont completely agree with this statement .but to some extent it is true .young people have a lot of energy and their brains would be very active seeking for adventures in thier lifes .this would help them plan there life and lead in an interesting way .they mostly hang-out with there friends , play a lot of sports , chat throughout the day in the college .they can even actively participate in various cultural activites held in there college .having a lot of capability and strength to learn new things they usually update themselves as per the growing technology .for examples using the computers , dancing listening to music and many such activities .people in the old age can not handle them properly and can not easily mingle with them .young people can easily learn things or grasp things things than the older one s do .this would help them get used to new cultures and adopt new ways of styles and traditions and even the food habits of various areas .all this would be a problem for the older people because anything new in style may deviate from their tradition like the change in clothing that younger generations adopt as per the fashions , it may be even the food that cause indigestion problem or someother illness .the drawback that the younger generation mainly have is the stress , due to the work load imposed on them .this burden may even lead to boredom or may even lead to a state of depression which would be very difficult for them to handle and even come out .all this is due to the lack of experience they have .it is at these situations that younger people come to the older people to seek their advice in handling or dealing such situations .it is the experience of the older people , which helps them to come out of these difficult situations many times and get into their routine life .the only thing appreciable about the older people is that they enjoy their lives at these stages by playing with their grand-children would would give a lot of pleasure and happiness for them regularly .illustratung all these events i would like to state
