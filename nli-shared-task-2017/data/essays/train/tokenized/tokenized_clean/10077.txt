i agree with the statement that advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .in today s world media plays a very important role .and this age of media is widely governed by advertisements .adverisement has become very important medium between consumer and producer .so people are greatly influenced by advertisements .each producer tries to impress people by its own tactics .in this bid to influence people they generally show many false points about their products .and people get in the trap of the companies .with the development of commercialization advertisements are also gaining their importance .now people are becoming more convinced by advertisements they see on televisions and newspapers .these companies are spending great deal of money in advertisements .they rarely think of spending the money in improving the quality of their products .as these companies are also aware that advertisements are becoming very crucial in the sale of their products .today their is great competition in the market .we can see number of products for same purpose .whenever a new product is lauched it is made familiar to people through advertisements .initially company offers some discounts to their product to encourage people to buy their product .and each advertisement tries to show that is the best available product in the market .people are greatly attracted by these advertisements .advertisements are generally false image of the product that companies try to bring before people .due to increased competition and to get maximum sale of their products companies show the points in their product whch are not true .at end i will like to conclude that advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .
