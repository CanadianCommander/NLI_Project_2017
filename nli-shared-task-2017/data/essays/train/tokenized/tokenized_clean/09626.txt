people travel to all over the world for various reasons .some do it because they want a change in their lives , whereas others do it beacause they want to explore the world and want to know about that place , the people and their culture .hence , i feel that if the reason is to explore the world or the place , the best thing is to do in a group led by a tour guide .a tour guide is a person who is professionally qualified to help and show people the places they are travelling to , so it would be really easy if you are with a tour guide .also , travelling in a group has its own charm .you are not only enjoinyg a new place but also you are sharing your experience and your joy with others too .although , i do agree if we are travelling in groups we dont possess the amount of freedom we would enjoy when we are alone but being in groups with a tour guide is beneficial in many other ways .firstly , since he is an expert you will get to explore and see all important places which you might miss if you are travelling alone .for example you might just miss amonument and you later regret that you might have consulted a tour guide .also , by chance if you face any kind of problems you have so many people helping you out .for example , you might have a problem with your health in a place which is new to you .it might be great cause of concern , whereas if you are travelling in a group you have so many people to count on .also , there are people in this world who do not have families or friends these kind of groups are really beneficial for them .it has been seen that after spending days together you really beacame friends even after you finish off with your trip .when people travel in groups they spend all extra time singing , enjoing , dancing with each other .even the time you spend on travelling becomes so exciting .to summarise i would say that travelling in groups led by a tour guide do take away some part of your freedom but it provides you with a real defination of enjoyment and excitement which you can never enjoy all alone .
