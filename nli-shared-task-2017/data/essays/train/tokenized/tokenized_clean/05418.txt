is a person only successful if he or she is willing to take risks ?the definition of success is of course a rather difficult one to begin with and must be considered as highly objective .success can be related to the business world , the world of sports , the home or even to a very private level .i would like to keep my essay as open as possible and not focus on one specific area .if a person sticks to a ` business as usual  policy all the time , i think that apart from not reaching higher goals , this person will also remain in a state of boredom .continuity is a safe strategy in times of instability and must always be considered .however , it should not become the main strategy .if a person takes risks , he or she is exposed to several unpleasant possibilities .there is of course always a danger of failure involved in all new and unusual approaches .people who strive for higher things and thus take risks are often made fun of .being creative and reaching for the stars has something frightening to other , less adventureous beings .another negative effect can be lonelyness .people who have visions and try to live them are often abondoned by friends who can not deal with the high reaching ambitions and maybe sometimes with the lack of scrouple that can be detected in the person who stives for success .being a pioneer has advantages as well , of course .reaching ones goals and being successful is rewarded with utter satisfaction and depending on what risk has been taken it can lead to world wide fame .personally , i agree with the statement .i see the negative sides of taking risks but i am convinced that we were born to live our dreams even if they may seem ridiculous or even stupid to others around us .it is not always the easiest thing to aim for something extraordinary and it can lead to countless difficulties .it is good to have a mixture of both worlds : being willing to take risks and knowing when to apply well-known procedures but i hold it with the old saying : no risk - no fun !
