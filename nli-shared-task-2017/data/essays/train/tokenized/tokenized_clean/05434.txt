nowadays , cars virtually become part of our daily lives .it is hard to imagine what the life will be without a car .we drive cars to shool , to office , to shoping malls , and , on weekends , to national parks .but if you ask me what will be the case twenty years later , i would hazard a guess that there will be fewer cars !to begin with , energy shortage looms larger nowadays .recent years wittness the skyroketing the crude oil prices is an example to illustrate the demand for oil far excesses the supply of it .the excess demand drives the price of the fuels drastically , so people will find it expensive to drive a car .probably using public transportations is a more economical choice to travel to school , to office and so on .in that case there will be fewer cars in use .another reason that may attribute to the shrinking of car usage is that cars , through burning fossil fuels , will pollute the environment .the exhaust of cars contains large amount of toxic gases such as sulfur and nitrigen oxicide , etc .when the pollution becomes more and more severe , the government will take measure to control the expansion of cars .the most possible measures are to levy higher taxes on using cars and to grant less driving licence to drivers .under such conditions , people will have less incentive to buy cars and use cars .in addition , the room for accomodating more cars is very limited .today we already feel very crowded on roads and parking lots .if cars continue to expand , we will have more and more severe traffic jams , which will render car transportation slow .if people find that they are always late in class or office , they will resort to alternative means of transportation such as bicycles and subways .taking into consideration all these factors mentioned , private car drivers as well as potential car buyers may think twice before using cars .twenty years later , cars may turn out to be an expensive and inconvenient way of going out .
