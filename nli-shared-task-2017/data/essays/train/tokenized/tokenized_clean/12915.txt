i personally disagree with the provided statement because i think that the number of cars in use will remain basically constant through the years .first of all , i believe that twenty years will not carry enough changes to produce a variation of our habits and way of living .even if the public transport will be presumably enhanced , most of the people will still need a car because the main commercial areas such as shopping centers , cinemas and other facilities will be located far away off the cities and they will still require a car in order to be reached .moreover , according to the statistics , people who live in town will move to the adjacent countrysides , owing to the high cost of living they are facing now .secondarily , the car industry will probably give its best in order to keep constant the annual income .solutions will be provided in order to let people replace their old vehicle , whithout just dismissing it .as an example , even now new methods of payment are being introduced to allow drivers to change their cars regularly during the years .i suppose that even the western governments will help the vehicle sector in order to inhibit the unemployment consequent to a possible crisis of the industry .in addition , in twenty years time , the pollution will probably cease to represent a problem .new hydrogen engines will be produced with the aim of contrasting the raise of the pollution rate in the air .people will be more confident in buying new cars with a new environment-friendly technology .owning a car will therefore remain a status of economic wealth that no-one would refuse .these reasons are in my opinion enough to justify why the number of cars will not change in twenty years .
