i do nt think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .it can be very convenient , of course : for example you do nt have to think about anything ( for instance car hiring , hotels , restaurants , museum tickets ... ) ; you simply sit down in the bus and enjoy the trip .furthermore , the guide is supposed to know everything about the places you visit and so she ( or he ) can tell you interesting stories about , as well .at the same time , though , travelling in a group led by a guide has a lot of disadvantages that , according to me , are not worthy .first of all , you have to respect a strict and not flexible timetable ; you ca nt choose what you want to visit or where you want to eat , for example .usually during tours there are thousands of things to do ( and some of them pretty awkward ) so you do nt have enough time to enjoy the places you see along the way ; in many cases you have just the time to get off the bus , take a picture and go back to the bus again .then , having to follow this strict plan , you ca nt ask to stop when you see something you think is really nice , even to take a picture .and , above all , you can stop to go to the toilet just when the plan tells that you are allowed to !sometimes you are obliged to do things you do nt like , as well .for example climbing a mountain even if you are afraid of it or sleeping in a camping where there is no water at all , except for a river in which `` friendly  crocodiles live .last , but not least , you never know people you will travel with : if you are lucky they will be very nice and you could go on with them quite well .on the contrary , if you are not lucky , you could have to stand for some days ( or a couple of weeks , that is even worst ) the company of a group of people that you really dislike , very different from you , sometimes very boring , sometimes too excited .all these things considered , together with my personal experience , make me prefer a journey by myself or with some very reliable friends .
