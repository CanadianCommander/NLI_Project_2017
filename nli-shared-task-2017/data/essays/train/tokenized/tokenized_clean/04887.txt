in my opinion the statement is too simple .there are also arguments demonstrating that older people may enjoy life more .older people have a lot of experience .they can judge and analyze certain events better than younger people .older people are often in a better financial position than young people are .so they often have the opportunity to buy things or to realize projects younger people maybe ca nt afford .with so much incertainty in the world today recent polls in germany for example demonstrate that older people feel more secure than twens or even teenagers .in a certain age one is able to review your life and to look back including the goals you achieved , but als the disappointments .young people are sometimes to optimistic about their opportunities and goals they can achieve , but with a certain experience of age some people gain a certain kind of realism that helps them to organize their life in a proper way .as newspaper articles and the tv shows many young people do have problems and are very sad .on the other hand younger people are generally healthier than older persons , so they can be more active and dont  need to take much care about illnesses or risks .they are maybe even not aware of the risks , what can be an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time , because you do nt really care about smoking or drinking risks .because many experiences in life can be negative , younger people are often less preoccupied with things than olders .they try things that are new for them instead of thinking about negative events older people automatically take in mind .in general you cant  say that younger people are better off than the generation of parents or grandparents .enjoying life is a matter of character and personal situation , not a question of age .in all generations there do exist happy and sad characters .every age can be enjoyable , but every time in life also covers the risk of disappointment or even pain .life is life .
