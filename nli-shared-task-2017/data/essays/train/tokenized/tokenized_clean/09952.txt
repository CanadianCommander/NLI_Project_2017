well , everybody agrees with the fact that the more knowledge we have , the better it is !but , is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?my response will be synthetize in two parts , because both propositions must be developped .first , while reading the sentence , i would probably say that it is better to have knowledge in many subjects .besides , it permits us to know better how stuff worked , how the world is moving , and also how relationships between humans are functioning .as far as i am concerned , i like to debat with my friends .i think that the knowledge is here necessary for two reasons : the first one is that to debat on a subject , it is better to know a bit about it !if you have a knowledge only in one domain and if the debat does not concern yours , you will probably get fastly lost on this debat .on the other hand , having a knowledge in many domain permit one thing which is primordious to have a good and constructive reflexion .i mean that to construct a good response , you will certainly have to pick up information in several domain , then confront them so you could arrive to a conclusion .if you only have one subject to talk about , your reflexion will be poor .but , can we really say that it is bad to have only knowledge in one subject ?well , people who are specialized in only one subject generally know it perfectly .i admire this people , by the simple reason that they can explain you so much things on this subject , and it is often very interesting to listen to them .even more , it is an advantage to find a job .many society often search people who have only one specific domain , so that they can be sure this man is the perfect one for the job .as a conclusion , i will say two things .the first one is that i think a person who is specialized in only one domain would always be able to learn rapidely another elements of another domain .but a person who knows lots of domain will certainly have many more difficulties to specilialized into one of it .finally , it is very interesting to talk with both of these persons to learn the most things as possible .but i do nt think we make the choice ourselves : it happens naturally .
