today it is very difficult to invent new things or find new ways to be succesful .but what is the best way to be successful ?should you take risks ?and for which persons it is easier to take risks ?in my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk .becauso there must by any reasons because this person is unsuccessful .so perhaps an unsuccessful person already took some risks which were not successful .so they are in a kind afraid of taking new risks .if the new idea is wrong they will lost again .and this is different at successful people .they have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks .they are not afraid .if the risk was wrong there is a base under them and nearly nothing could happen to them .but one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks .for this i will give an example .you have to imagine you are the ceo at a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world .but there are several smaller companies which are coming closer and closer .one day a customer want you to create a new product , but with your machines this is not possible to take the order .the customer sais that he will go to the other companies if you do not built or create the necessary machienes .taking the order will cost a lot of money and the success is not sure .what would you do ?i think it is much easier to take the order for a company with very much success .they know they can take risks because if the order will not be good it will not be all over .it is different for a ceo who s company does not work right .on the one hand the company needs the order but on the other hand it is the end of the company if the order will not be successful .another reason is that successful people always want more .so they do not think about as much as unsuccessful people .so i think it is easier to take risks if you are a successful pearson .
