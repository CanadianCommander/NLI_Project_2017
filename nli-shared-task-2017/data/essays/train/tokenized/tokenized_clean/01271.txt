i agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people are strong , smarter and they can do work fastly comparing to older people .young people enjoy life in different ways , they often go to movies , shopping etc .now-a-days young people are more brilliant , more smarter .young people when they go to parks or movie they feel enthusiasm .for example , i am a young student i feel more enjoy when i spent with my friends .i often spend most of time with my friends , we went to movies , parks etc .really i spend most of my time on new year day with my friends really it was enjoyable day for me and i often meet so many friends and i tell new year wishes with them .young people enjoy life more than older people but young people have to remember one thing you have to give respect , and you have to look them and you should be kind and respectful to them .finally , young people enjoy in different ways and they have curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things .one disadvantage about young people is that they do some things wrongly beacause thay are teenagers .
