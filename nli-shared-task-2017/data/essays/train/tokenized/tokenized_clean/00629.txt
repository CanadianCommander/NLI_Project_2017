the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are has growned to be old-fashioned and too simplistic .in my opinion , perhaps in the early days of advertisement the public was more naive and advertisers themselves considered that the effect of advertisement was much more powerful that it really is .today , i believe that advertisers have come to realize that it is much more effective to convey emotions and concepts related to the product than to state its wonderful and nearly miraculous properties .why ?for two reasons .first of all , the public is nt as naive as some people might consider .they might be tempted to try a product that seems better than it really is , yet come to find that it is not as good .this can be harmful for the product s sales in two ways : the consumer will not buy it again , and he/she will feel cheated , misguided and angry .therefore , the image of the product will be damaged .as a second reason for why i believe that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are is that advertisers know that it is better to work upon the real-deal .that is , tell the consumers that what they see is what they will get .however , advertisers do try to make consumers think that what they will get is what they need .i believe that other than displaying the properties of products on television or radio , advertisements work more and more on consumer s needs and motivations .they wo nt lie , they know that their consumers are nt fools , but they will try to convince you that a particular product is the one that best adapts to your needs .it is a sutile yet powerful difference .
