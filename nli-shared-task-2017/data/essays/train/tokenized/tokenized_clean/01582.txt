before deciding which side i will stand , i would like to querry what is defined as successful people .if successful people mean people who made a big advance in our life , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks .however , if successful people mean people who live well doing their jobs well , i think successful people are those who only do what they already know how to do well .first , you should know the history of human s first exploration of the moon .i think the people who were involved in that momentous event are those who are successful .unless did they plan to travel to the moon and enact their plan , we could have made no progress in our knowlege of the universe and our technology in relaion to aironaut .with respect to human knowlege advance , i believe that successful peopel are those who try to do what has not been done .second , i even can observe how people move towards what they want .for example , my husband make seemingly unfeasible things possible .when he faces a barrier , such as dealine , facility unavailities , and job opening , he tries evey means .he call to companies that do not announce any jod  b opening .but , he advertise himself and get a position .he enjoys his way of life , which seems to make him as a successful person .however , i also can find people who lives well without a big challenge .for example , medical doctors seem to live well following well-defined paths .although they have to study had in roder to get into a medical school , i think they do not have to try new medical procedures .on the ready-established path , they are considered as successful people .in sum , it is difficult to devide people into successful and unsuccessful people according to whether they try new things and take risks or not .rather than , i think successful peole could be defined according to whether individual lives the way of life they value .if a person who pursues taking a risk lives by trying new opportunities , he would be a successful person .if a person who pursue a challenge lives in a way that is already established , he would not be considered as a successful person .
