i disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i think that to understand ideas and concepts is very important , but i think also that to learn facts are not less important thant ideas and concepts .they are at least at the same level .i think that ideas and concepts are at the base of a theory and so they are at the base of our knowledge , but sometimes facts can replace and modify the original theory , so it is important to know real facts !in italy there is a famous affermation that is `` la migliore teoria e  la pratica  that can be translate in english with `` the best theory is the real pratice  , and i think that this affermation represent perfectly my opinion .in our world there are a lot of jobs that need a lot of experience , and experience can be `` reached  only by facts rather than with ideas and concepts , that they are also important of course , but without facts nobody can `` reach  an high amout of experience .another example is a normal math exam : to prepare a math exam we ca nt only study theory on the theory book , we must do a lot of exercise if we wont to understand how the theory is used in realty , or at least how the theory is used in the exercise that will be in the exam .in the end , i dont know if my thought about the importance for students to learn facts is condivided by all other people , because i know that there can be a lot of people that thought that is important only to understand ideas and concepts , but that is my opinion and i think that is right .
