i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my view there are a variety of arguments to support this statement :first of all young people do not have as much duties as older people have .the do not really have to think about how to feed their families or how to raise and educate their childs .consequently in my opinion young people have a lot more flexibility .for example when i want to go on holidays to visit some of my friends in spain and can do it .as a unmarried student i do not have to ask a wife or a boss for the permission .furthermore young people have more leisure time .you can not compare the time people spend at work with the time young people have to be present in school or university .even when preparation time is added a regular job takes far more time .according to my personal experiences my leisure time and especially my holidays are twice as long as those from my father .moreover young people are often in a better condition than older people .for me it is important to do as much sports as possible .i really enjoy to keep myself in shape and to train a lot .with regard to my father or my grandfather i noticed that older people are often injured or can not accomplish their own expectations .i recognized that this fact is every disappointing especially for my grandfather who had been an excelent sportsman .taking everything into account i think that my years at school and university would propably be the best of my entire life .therefore i am a little bit scared of growing older and be confronted with the presented disadvantages .
