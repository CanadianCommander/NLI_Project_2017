albeit this is a possibility , i do not think that it is likely to occur .there ara a couple of reasons which make me think in this way .first of all , it is a very clear fact that the oil reserves we have today are coming to an end and probably in the very near future scarcity will be more apparent .and when those days come , we will not be able to find oil to use for our needs as easily as we do today .and , this factor will surely affect many sectors .no doubt , car industry will be among those sectors , may be the foremost .because , oil is being used both as an energy provider for the engine and used in the production of many parts of the car such as its tires , dash board etc .so , in a situation of oil dearth , it will be highy difficult to use oil for the car industry because it will increase the costs enormously .even if the car producers find it still accurate to go on productin in this situation , they will have to sell it very expensive .and this will affect the consumers .they will think on the one hand the prices of oil necessray for dunnin the car and the on the other hand the price of the car .and , as a result it can be expected that car uses will dorp down .but , nearly everybody knows that oil resources are coming to an end .so , sectors which will be affected from this situation are investing enoumous amounts of money for alternative energy resouces / hydrogen is among the most popular of these potential resources .it is nearly a common idea that in a near future alternative resourses will be used .also  people are accostemed to using cars .they like its comfort .so they will cont
