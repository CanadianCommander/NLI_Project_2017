first of all , i do not disagree with the statement of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , and secondly , i think this statement is merely based on the stereotypes which the adults project on adolescents .nowadays , young people are acting more independent than their seniors .they know more of what they want , why they want it and how they going to get it .however , this change does not please most of the adults who still believe in the social hierarchy of age which is keeping juniors under control .this is the crux of the problem , and in this case , the two paries see the title and definition of `` helping thier communities  differently .in my neighborhood , there is a brilliant young girl who has saved many children from domestic abuses .whenever sara hears parents beating their kids in a much too violent way , she is brave enough to report to the authorities concerned about each severe case in the community .nevertheless , most of the adults complaint about her behavior to her parents , and sara get grounded several times for rescueing bleeding children and even bruised infants .moreover , in my colleage years , i have seen students organizing clubs which aim at supervising the school s recycling operaiont or urging more tree planting on campus .most of their schemes , even in their most well-designed and pratical form , are rejected .the school s reluctance to participate in such community reform activities shows a rather great contrast to the students  effort and desire of changing the world into a paradise .as far as i know , only young people of sara s age admire her devotion to the neighborhood , and the adults simply see her as a trouble .also , the club members in my college never give up any chance to come to the community s aid despite the negativeness of the school .these situations teach me a lesson about how aduts or the whole society will not always be right .young people from around the world all possess great passions in helping their communities to become a better place to live , and sometimes , they are even more enthusiastic than the grown-ups surrounding them .
