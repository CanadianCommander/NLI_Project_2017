i oppose to the saying that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they are given more time and chances to help others in their communities and they indeed do so .the reasons also includes the fact that it is hard to define how much time for young people is `` enough  in helping others in their communities .my opinion is that helping in communities , anyway , is not supposed to be the center of the life of young people .first of all , it should be noticed that more and more educational system take community service as a part of tasks that students have to do .by doing this , students , in fact , are given more time and chances to help others in their communities .and in reality , it works well in many systems .take my personal experience as an example .in my high school , everyone has to choose at least one service called `` social service  .instead of having classes in afternoons , we go to local families , primary schools , immigrants centers to help others of the community .my social service is going to `` school of peace  every friday afternoon and playing with the children there .my classmates and i spent a lot of time there last semester .therefore , saying that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities is too general and regardless of the better reality .secondly , some people might ask , `` how much time should young people spend in helping their communities ?it is hard to say and define .however , it is widely accepted that the focus of young people should be studying .if a youth does not have enough knowledge or skill , how can he or she help the others ?in their age , they are supposed to expose themselves to different fields of knowledge and take advantages from them .later in their life , after they are fully educated , they will have chances , time and wish to devote themselves to helping others in their communities .to sum up , i think that now young people are spending a lot of time in helping their communities and the time is enough .on one hand , being involved in community service is becoming a part of education in increasing number of education systems .the youths are spending a lot of time in communities .on the other hand , the time that have been used by them to community service is enough already for the fact that learning is the primary task that they should focus on at their age anyway .
