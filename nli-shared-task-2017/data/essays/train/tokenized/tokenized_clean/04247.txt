generally it is argued that what student should understand .the ideas and concepts ?or facts ?even though facts are crucial for learning , the time of learning facts is not the time of being student .during being students , ideas and concepts should be learned .facts comes after ideas and concepts .if you do not understand the meaning of ideas and concepts , you can not realize the facts or you can not comprehend the facts .for example in food engineering department when the lecture teaches students about the haccp  facts , after graduation upon working , this teaching leads to problems such as making the products decay .the facts always change under some circumstances .while it is true that the facts are very important to learning , ideas and concepts are as important as facts .they force students to think analytically .in this way students can gain their analytical ability .therefore they can consider problems with a different perspective when they encounter the problem .they can find the facts with using their analythe above said leads me to conclude that during student life understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students .
