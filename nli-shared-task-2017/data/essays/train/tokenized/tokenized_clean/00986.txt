`` if only had youth the wit , and old age the time ,  i heard once .the answer to the above-mentioned question is hidden within this magic sentence .implying that young people , out of lack of experience , make a lot of mistakes and people old enough to become experienced do not have the time to use their experience fully , one has to conclude that the old people have no choice but to enjoy life more than the young ones .young people have fun , live adventures , keep falling in and out of love , yes : all of this is true .yet do they really know what they re doing ?are they even aware of how they re wasting the precious time they have ?no .only after they reach a certain age can they appreciate the value of experiences .only after losing the opportunity of living the life they really want to live can they understand how valuable their past memories are and value the little time they have left to complete their unfinished businesses before they die .do not mistake me , i am not at all implying that the elder have the energy to get up and go out and have fun in the exact same way a young person can .i m simply saying that whatever they do , even if it is the simplest thing to do like feeling the wind on one s skin or eating a homemade meal cooked by their wives , they do it with utmost intensity .after all , it s not the quantity that counts , but the quality .one more reason i believe the older people enjoy life more than young people is because the young people , no matter how successful they have been that far , still have a life ahead of them , full of worries : are they going to be successful ?are they going to be able to properly support a family ?older people , having lived through these worries , are past this episode of tension and are relieved .if they have grandchildren , for instance , they know that it is their biggest accomplishment .if they do not have grandchildren , on the other hand , they are aware that worrying will be useless for there s the chance has passed them .so all they have to worry about is enjoying the rest of what s left of their lives .examples and situations may vary with personalities and periods .yet one thing stays the same , the fact that even though young people believe that they re enjoying life more than older people , it is the exact opposite .therefore even though as a twenty one year old person myself , i tend to wish that i am enjoying life better than my seventy year old grandparents , their quality of enjoyment is much better than mine .
