old people and young people have not the same activities , hobies , and tastes .in fact , your life is totally different from an age to an other .whill young people study older people have more responsabilities .however when people are young they are not considerate as adults so they can do what ever they wish for : have fun with their friends , party a lot , not take of the house , not have duties ...altough , they have to work a lot to get a good future .young people chose in a way what they will be after .if they study well , they can have a better job .this is nt a great joy , your are in competition with all of yours friends , you might loose some friends for better grades .so in oder to have fun after school they have to be determinate .nevertheless , after school when you get a nice job well paid you will still have to work hard all your life .it s not easy , it s stressfull .people can be alone , when you are at school you have the oportuninity to make a lot a friend because you come from the same area , the same town , you have the same interess whereas whem people get older they fell lonely , sometimes because they do nt like their jobs or it s hard for them to be part of worklife .altought if you get money you can travel a lot or sometimes enjoy yourself with your family and friends , but these moments are very rare .whem peopleget older they have new responsabilities in life : children , house and job .finally , old people can have an enyoing life when they are retired .in fact , they can do what they always wanted to do : travel , take of their grandechildren .in my opinion , when you can have a certain balance between school and freetimes young people have more fun than older people .altough life is never easy : the age do nt depend on when you can be protected or prevented from bad things .
