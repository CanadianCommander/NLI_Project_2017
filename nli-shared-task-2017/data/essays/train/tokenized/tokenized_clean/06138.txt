it is obvious that people have more energy and desire in the earlier times of their lives , however this does not indicate that young people would enjoy life more than older people do .i think that it is possible to enjoy life at all ages , provided that we keep our spirits and minds contemporary and young .most people say that there are certain things that can only be done when we are young .for instance , extreme sports , partying late hours , eating excessively or even falling in love .i agree the fact that there are certain activities that we can not perform after a certain age , nevertheless i believe that it is not only a matter of activities that keep us young but it is the state of mind we are in .basically , i think that there are different joys people get from life when they are young and old .when we are young , we search for the unconventional , unfundamental and extraordinary and we can go for it no matter what .as we get older , we begin to think of the results , effects and evaluate situations more carefully .these are the different levels of joy that we can get when we are young and old .youth brings along lots of energy , excitement and desire to reach the unknown and accomplish the undone .this has a certain joy factor , but only as long as we are young .trying to act such cluelessly in older times may lead us to alienment from life and society because we have more responsibilities as we grow older .even though our responsibilities increase and we may be limited by the society as we get older , i do not think that we would be enjoying life less .if we could accept getting old and adopt ourselves to the changing environment , we can always enjoy life because there is an endless energy in life , we only need to capture it and connect with it .no matter how large the numbers get on our age , we always have the opportunity to enjoy life if we have the energy and the mentality to do so .being dynamic and having a loving and caring family and friends that connect us to life would always enable us to enjoy life at all ages .
