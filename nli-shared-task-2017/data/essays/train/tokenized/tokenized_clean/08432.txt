this question ask about `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i agree with this question because the understand ideas and concepts is more important than to know the fact .idea and concepts have a lot of information .and it can learn and concrude the information to see the fact is more interesting than just find out the result .understand idea and concepts are like a untouched diamond .untactched diamond rock is a lot of material in and not so beautiful , but people separate the material they do nt need to make pure diamond .this is the metafore that i use to discribe the `` understand ideas and concepts.  understand the idea and concepts are very interesting than just to learn facts .why it become fun because i do myself to find a good result or facts it is very interesting for me to learn the way to finish .i can learn the process of solving the question .that is the good part of learning and understanding idea using the information .if you do this process you would understand how much fun to get a result with joy .learn facts are not a good idea .it like you face the question but you would get the answer right away .it is not fun just you get the answer and not the process .that is why learn the basic process to understand the way to answer is great .the process of get the result is good for student because if they learn the enjoyment of learning they would think hard and more concentrate .learn fact is not a good thing because i can only learn the sarface of the fact .if i understand ideas and concepts i could find a great information that hide in the sarface .in my conclusion is i agree the idea of the question .the first point is it would be fun to do the process in middle to get the fact .the second point is the student would learn about abustruct or hidden idea under the surface .
