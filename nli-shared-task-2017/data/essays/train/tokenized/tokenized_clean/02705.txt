i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .indeed , it is important not to focus on only one aspect of things and life .the world around us is made with plenty of different things that one should be familiar with .having a large scale of knowledge allows us to understand almost everything that happens in our society , and therefore we do nt have to rely on others  knowledge in order to make our own opinion .there are many different ways of seeing things and event .if we are able to watch things only from one point of view , we might miss the most important .for example , when you listen to a politician you might have some economical knowledge and thus understand part of his speech .thus , if what he says is economically accurate you will tend to agree with him .but if instead you have law knowledge you might understand it a totally different way and if what he says is not accurate in a law point of view , you will totally disagree with him .on the other hand , if you have knowledge both in law and in economy , you will be able to take the speech as a whole and to make a balance between law and economic interests .then your opinion seems to me more valuable to me .on a more practical point of view , i think that , in today society , we must be able to adapt to very different situation .for example i will certainly have to change of jobs several times .if i am very specialized in one specific subject , i wo nt have a large scale of possibility .thus , the larger the scale of my knowledge , the more chance i will have to find a job that suit me .in addition , employers now ask to their employees to be able to adapt to different situation and to be able to manage very different issues .therefore they need to have broad knowledge of difffent subjects .but on the other hand , i am conscious that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject should nt lead to have only superficial knowledges .it is also important to be able to go depper into a specific subject .but i am of the opinion that if you are able to understand a large scale of subject , it will then be easier to focus more specifically on one , being able to understand all the implications the subject can bring , not being trap in a narrow way of seeing things .
