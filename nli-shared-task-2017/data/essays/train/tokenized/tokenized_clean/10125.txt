i ca nt help thinking that people who take risks have to be rewarded .but there are all the same numerous limits at this judgement .first , i am convinced that when a person takes risks , she must be aware of the dangers of a possible failure .when that person knows these dangers , i feel that if she achieves what she wanted , she is rewarded for numerous endeavours she did .for instance , when a man or a woman decides to open a store or a restaurant , he or she does not know the success of it .if this person works hard in order to improve his or her way of life , it is normal that his or her situation changes positively .furthermore , ambitious people can employ other people and help the society to fight against the unemployment .in general , good things come to those who have the ambition to change their life .however , numerous people make efforts to change their life but they do nt succeed .they do nt have the success they hoped and are not rewarded .what s more , people who do only what they already know how to do well should be successless than people who take risks , at the conditions that they are aware of what they do .we must also take into account the level of risks .indeed , the success may be proportional to the rate of risks , it is tantamount to saying that people who take more risks should be more rewarded .for instance , when a man becomes a manager , he takes more risks than he was a simple employee .he earns , therefore , more money than before .i would like to conclude by saying that i agree with this statement because , as i see it , people who take risks should be rewarded .however , they must know the consequences of a failure before starting their business .
