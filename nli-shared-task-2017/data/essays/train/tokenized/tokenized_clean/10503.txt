the life brings out too many alternatives for a person for enjoying the life .the hard thing for him/her is being able to do that thing .the reasons behind this `` ability  can be the age , environmental factors or family situations .but if we consider only the age , i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .altough i am only twentytwo years old and have not experienced being old , i agree this statement from my observations .my basic arguments and observations are as following ; young people have more physical abilities than the do older people and they mainly do not think about all the apects of a situation these two help them while enjoying the life .first of all phisical abilities are very important .because if a person is not able to go , do , or reach something there is going to be a limitation for him/her .for instance , i think that sea holidays are important experineces for people .although it seems relaxing , it contains traveling , adapting a different weather if the person has gone a different place , and lastly sitting under the sun .these are very very vital elements that can harm an old person s health conditions .he/she has to think very carefully before going and if she/he is gone she/he has to take care of himself/herself .but mainly young people do not have these kind of limitations and can go if the conditions let them go .additionally , older people mainly think deeply about the situations that they face .i think this is an unconcious fact and a result of being experienced .the experience that they have help them to predict the results of the situations and they may hesitate about doing something .however , i think this case being unexperienced is more advantageous .bacause , a person with lack of experience does not consider mainly the results of something .in this point i am not talking about considering the circumstances at that time .the point i want to reach is caring too much about the results and i think what the older people do is that .this makes them too caringabout the results and limited .in conlusion , if only the age is considered , younger people have more advanteges for enjoying the life than the old people .but in fact it is not the only parameter for the enjoy a person has from his/her life .an old person can enjoy life than do a young person if additional parameters like family conditions are included in this statement .
