i disagree with the statement that argues most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i think most people are mislead by few aggressive opinions and blaming advertisements for wrong reasons .however , i admit that there are some advertisements , especially in food , hotels and restaurants , that try to make false impression on consumers by adding colors or increasing the volume or showing pictures of long time ago .but in most cases , i think most advertisement are honest about their products .especially thanks to the arising public awareness , companies are being more careful to be truthful and honest when communicating to consumers through advertisements .the main purpose of advertisement is to make people want to consume or buy a product or service .in order to do that , advertisement focuses on getting attention to draw interest from consumers .that is why they use famous actors and actresses or flashy visuals or loud and upbeat music .but that does not have anything to do with making the product or service look better at all .if a pair of clothes looks better when it s put on by famous actress in an advertisement than by yourself , it is only your imagination that it looks better in the ad .these effects make people feel happy or imagine something fun which lead them to think that the product looks good or beautiful .but it is important to be aware that it is not because they did something to the product .advertisements are only adding context to the product to let the people imagine something fun or beautiful and have that imagination relate to the product .when people watch or see advertisement , they should be aware of this effect to protect themselves from false impression caused by their own imagination .in addition to that , partly due to regulation , there are advertisements which describe not only the strength and benefit but also risk and weakness associated with the products such as prescription drugs .it seems contradictory to the main purpose of advertisement but in the end , honest communication should be paid off by trust and loyalty from consumers .i think the importance of honest communication between company and consumer are being recognized in the corporate world .
