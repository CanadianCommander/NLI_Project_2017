i am inclined to support both positions because both have their own validity .however , i believe that , in the next future , there will be more cars in use compared to now .i am deeply convinced , in fact , that many development countries , such as china or india , in the next twenty years , will improve their economy .althought they have different traditions , and diverse ways in witch they move in their country , they will probably start to buy cars .at the moment , just a few millions of chienese people have enough money to buy a car , but in the future , they will be able to afford it .moreover a few days ago , when i was at home , i wacthed a tv s program about this topic .it was focused on the chinese s reality and it tried to explain what are their dreams .i was really surprised because they said that car is the most important dream for this poplutation .in fact , they admired our society and they probably would like to have the same `` quality of life  as we have .althought we already known that cars are doing many problems in our earth and plante , in fact , will still using it .i am deeply convinced that if you live in a big city ( rome or barcelona for instance ) you will have pollution s problem .for this reason when i became older i decide to sell my car .i have nt had a car since 2000 .after that my father decided to give me a gift : a bmw .it was so nice and i was so excited , but two years later i decided to sell it .i believe that car does nt improve our `` quality of life  and for this reason i really do hope that in twenty years the situation wo nt be different respect i have just written in this essay .
