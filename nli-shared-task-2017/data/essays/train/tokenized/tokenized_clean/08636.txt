i strongly agree that students should have a good understanding of the topics .they should have a deeper knowledge of the concept and ideas .whereas learning from facts can be additional to it but one can not solely depend on that .various examples can be given in support of it .a good student is one who thoroughly studies the topic .goes deep into the understanding and then correlates it with his views and ideas .in this manner he/she will have strong basics .for example , in science subjects or in physics conceptualisation is the key factor .if we do nt study the intial steps like in physics various theorems and priciples we can never solve difficult problems in future .a strong basic understanding of all areas will help us to deal almost everything .furthermore , if ideas are put on paper or uses them one will comes out with novel innovations .like while doing experiments we put some reported ideas of a reseacher to our work .and we come out with entirely new results .so by putting someones idea which he had thought of we accidently or intelligently come out with a new concept .so surely studying well and applying ideas can improve our capabilities .facts can be a guiding souce but true knowledge comes from understanding things .this can also be applied in other fields of music , dance and art .in these fields if do not know the basic concept of - do re me fa so , one can not proceed futher to specialise in music .on the other hand in art work like in painting one should know the standards of using a painting brush , how to use it at the first place ? .similiarly , in dance as in salsa or any other western dance one should know the basic way of doing it then only can learn other difficult steps .so i would conclude by stating that one should make their basics strong in order face difficult challenges in life and this applies to all fields .
