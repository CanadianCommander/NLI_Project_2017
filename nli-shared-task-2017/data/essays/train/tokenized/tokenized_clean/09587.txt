nowadas , advertisemnts become a very hot topics that everyone want to discuss it .some people thinks that advertisements are quite good ; however , others think that most advertisements make products seem much beetter than they really are .from my point of view , i agree with the second opinion .first of all , the purpose of the advertisements lead the businessman to lie to audience .there are a lot of same products in the maket .every businessman want to sale their own products and make money .why people buy their products ?they can persude consumer to buy their products by making the advertisements .however , if they do not describe the products much better than they really are , consumers will not buy this products , so thay the businessman will not sale the products and make the money .secondly , the famous people like to make money by telling the lie to audiences .people are always very curiostiy .they want to know more about the live of sport stars , singing stars , moive stars .one way to know the famous people better is to buy the products which they introduce by the advertisement .the producer know that people always believe what the famous people say .for example , a famous movie star in hong kong tell the audiences that use this mask wil let you look like 10 years younger in a mask advertisement .after watching this advertisement in the tv , a lot of women go to the shop to buy this mask .alll wise audience notices what the movie star says will not come true .there are still many people believe this advertisement .three months latere , a news report that this mask is very harmful to woman and it will be banned to sale .in conclusion , it is true that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .in order to be a wise consumer , you need to know what is real and you can not believe everything the famous people says .
