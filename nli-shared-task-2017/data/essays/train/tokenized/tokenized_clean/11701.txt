nowdays , before the launch of the any product it is usually advertised .the advertisement of any product helps alot in its marketing .advertisements are so catchy that makes the viewers to think over the product and sometimes they are convinced to buy it .but usually it has been observed that the actual product is so effective as shown in the advertisements .i have been also misleaded by one of the advertisements .i was having dark circles under my eye .so , one of my friends suggested me an under eye gel .she came to know about the gel from its advertisement .in the advertisement it has been given that it will decrease the dark circle .and one have to be regular in applying it .the course period was about 3 weeks .so , i tried the under eye gel .in first few weeks it was giving positive results but as the time passed i noticed wrinkles under my eye .and my dark circle were also not improving .the gel has the side effect of causing wrinkles to my skin .and was not helpfull in clearing all darkness .i was really dissappointed by this .so by this i came to learned that product in the advertisements are sometimes are much better than they actual are .the advertisement companies do this in order to promote their product .but they actually are foolishing the customers .like this there are several examples .another example can be the good , actractive packing of the candies , toffees , icecreams and etc. but in actuall they can be tasteless .also this in dress materials this is been seen .thus from the above points i believe that advertisements does nt given the actual picture of the product .
