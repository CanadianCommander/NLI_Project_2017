eventhougth , some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject ; there are other people that think it is more important to have a huge knowledge about one specific topic .based on my own experience , i can said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , so i agree with the statement .i have been working in a big oil company since 2000 and in these time i could do a lot of thing and i learned a lot of things of many subjects .in fact i am geophycis and i am going to do a master in business next year and it is a result that in these six years i did a lot of different thing in a different position in my company .i think that if i can do a master in business i will have more skills in order to reached a good position into my company because i will do the same work that i am used to do , but in addition i will be prepared to face a different challenges .i am sure that is better have knowledge of different academic subjects because this give us the skill to do a lot of different works , it is very important in a world where the technology are changing very fast , and where it is difficult to know how the reality can change so it is neccesary to be prepared for these changes moreover to have the skills to survive into a competitive world .in conclusion i strongly agree with the idea that is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects because in this way we can have a open vision about any problems and we have more skills in order to survive in a competitive world .
