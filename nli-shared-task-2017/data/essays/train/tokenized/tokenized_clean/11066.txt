nowadays , it is known that a lots of cars are being used and that companies are selling a lots of them because people can buy them .moreover i think that people want to buy them thereforet it would nt be a normal fact that the number of cars decreased in the future .nevertheless could you imagine that it happens ?it would be a terrible new for me because i lovew cars !first of all i think that cars are very important for us and that everyone would have to have a car because it allows you to drive wherever you want whenever you want .in addition , i think that the number of cars will increase insted of decreasing because some countries had already allowd 16 year-old boys to drive .that means that more cars are going to be bought .another reason why i think that there wo nt be more cars in the future is because the market and companies are improving their models .that s why people are more interested in cars .additionaly the market produces what the people want to buy .finally i must say that i have already pass my car exam and i also have bought a new car .i love my car and i think that it allows me to do a lot of things that a could nt do such as going out at nights with my friends without paying a taxi or going to the beach with my girldfriend .in conclusion i do nt agree with the sentence because when i wanted to buy my car a recieved a lot of information about the topic and i really think that it is imposible that the number of cars decrease in the future because everything is improving the car-market .
