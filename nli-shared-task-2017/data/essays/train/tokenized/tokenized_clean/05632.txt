the massive development of advertisement strategies represents one of the most relevant characteristics of the `` consumption society  we live in .the goal of the marketing is not necessarily to make the product seem much better than it really is , but rather to attract the consumer s attention on the product .first , in many cases , emphasis is put on one special feature of a certain product , rather than on overall quality .we will illustrate such claim with an example .advertisements of soap to clean the kitchen board have been some of the most common commercials on tv at least for the last twenty years .producers know that , in spite of minor differences , all the competing products are very similar .market targets are likely to be aware of this , too .therefore , these commercials usually do not try to convey the message that product a is better than b , c , d , but rather they aim to stress a particular feature .for example , one advertisment might put the emphasis on the nice smell produced by the soap , another on how fast it is to use .in this way , each producer aims to differentiate her product from the other along a particular dimension and to become attractive for a particular target of consumers , thus creating a special market niche .second , advertisements usually rely on a specific eye-catching image that stays impressed in the consumer s mind .referrign again to the example illustrated in the previous paragraph , companies often hire a movie or tv star who acts as housekeeper in the commercial .such tactic has nothing to do with emphasizing how good the product is .however , it creates a reference point for the housekeeper who is about to go to do the grocery .it is a somewhat subliminal message that conveys the message : `` if i use this product , i coudl be like her one day !.another good example refers to the commercials for cars .most of them show the car crossing deserts or magnificient coast roads in exotic places .there is probably no consumer who really cares about whether or not the car can really cross a desert .yet , such image stays impressed , and the consumer will inadvertently associate that model of car with an idea of freedom , long travels , adventure .in addition , there are some commercials that are just deliberately stupid .they rely on some joke or message that provokes the same reaction in everybody : `` who the hell created such a stupid commercial ! ?.well , if potential consumers wonder about this , the goal has been achieved .the product has a place in the consumer s mind .and maybe that brand name will come out when he or she goes to the commercial center the day after .in conclusion we want to stress how it is of course important that consumers perceive the product as a good one , not as a `` lemon  .however , this is probably a secondary point in the mind of a creator of advertisements : the emphasis is not on the exaggeration of the quality of the product , but rather on the way it is possible to attract consumers  attention on the promoted product , through the usage of particular creative messagges .
