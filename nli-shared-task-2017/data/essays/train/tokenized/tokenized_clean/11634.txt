in my opinion , the given statement is right on the one hand , but it is not able to be used to every specific subject on the other .classes of different subjects have always been different and will always require different strategies to handle the material which is taught in them .for those subjects who tend to be in the technical and scientific area , understanding the main way of working is far more important than any detail .in general , understanding the facts of how something , e.g. a motor of an entire power plant works is more important than learning and knowing any single detail without really knowing what purpose they are for .in my opinion , especially scientific subjects like chemistry or biology and technical subjects like engineering will get along wonderfully with that statement .for those kinds of students , it has to be important to understand the function of techniques they are confronted with while attending their classes , omitting minor details ( which are often omitted by professors and teacher themselves ) .after university , being confronted with your job , there is no use for those who learned by heart any single detail of a machine they are confronted with now , but not knowing the way this particular machine works in general .in addition to that , minor details are also often described right on the machine , but their general way of working is not and should have been understood earlier .moreover , i think ideas and concepts are were and still are the basement for development and research .with monotonously learning and repeating facts , it is far more difficult to understand and without knowing about the core concept , there is no possibility for progress and new development , e.g. in the medicine and biochemistry .but nevertheless , understanding the concepts is not always the one way to success .being very helpful in technical subjects , i still think that you should not use this method in subjects like history .in these specific classes , detailed facts of our past are equal in importance as understanding the concept , e.g. the concept of communism invented by lenin .to put it in a nutshell , i am convinced that the given statement , which is to concentrate on an idea than to the facts , can be very useful for everything concerning development and technique , but it should not be used to those classes that deal with the past .in these particular subjects , you should spend half the time for the ideas and the other half for the facts .
