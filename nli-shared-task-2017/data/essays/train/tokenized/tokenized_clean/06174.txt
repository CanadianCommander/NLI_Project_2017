usually , when we think about globalization and its consequences , we often focus on economics implication or technological ones .one major change that this controversial process has brought - but that is too frequently omitted - concerned the way people are travelling .as a matter of fact , since the internet has started to be available almost everywhere , a lot of destination that used to be unaccesible for the common traveller are now safe and cheaper .this whole new environment led many travellers to quit the traditionnal way of travelling abroad - in a group with a tour guide - for a wilder type of trip : alone without anybody to guide you - no matter what your destination is .as far as i am concerned , i truly think that this new wave in the travelling industry is a good thing since it is way more interesting and exciting than the oldfashioned one .first , travelling alone give you more liberty to visit what really you are really interested in .if you do not like art museums then you wo nt be obligated to spend hours of your limited amount of time in a specific city admiring the work of picasso .travelling on your own allow you to make up your personal itineary according to your tastes and not on the tour guide ones .in the same order of ideas , travelling in a group can imply a lot of other constraints that may make your trip less enjoyable .for instance , you often have to be at a specific place really early in the morning so you do nt really have the `` right  to sleep in the morning , go the bed late etc .however , the main disadvantages of travelling in a group with a tour guide is that it does not give you the opportunity to fully `` live  and understand the culture of the country you are visiting .usually , tour guides bring you to the touristic hot spots where everyone speak english , have a camera and is able to act in a western way .consequently , you do nt really experience the real way of living of the locals as you do not get the chance to share their everyday lives .on the opposite , travelling on your own - either with your backpack or in a more luxious way - allow you to explore hidden place , to get in touch with ordinary people from the street and to take the time to learn about the other .i could go on with many others reasons that support my idea that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide but ultimately , i think than choosing the way you want to travel is more a matter of personality , of budget and of interest .there is bad way of travelling .but there is certainly one that suit you better .
