helping our communitis is very important .sometimes we can see some students giving time to helping their communities , but it s not very often .i agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .one reason that i think that young people do nt spend much time for their communities is the school rul .in high school and college they have a kind of rul - like a homework - that a student have to help his or her community at list 10 hour per year .we could think that school has this kind of rul to teach importance of helping community , but the truth is they have this rul because it s hard to see young people giving time for their communities .some people would say i saw many young people helping their communities but they are doing it because they have to .second reason is commuties are in need of helpers .they have a lot of things to do so thay need many people .almost communities do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people .as long as there is no young people who wants to help the communities , communities leave works undond and this is happening a lot .why the young people do nt help their communities ?it s because young people think that spending time ofor theit communities is such a wasting time .to change this mind of young people , we have to give them programs or opportunity to make them realize the importance of helping communities .
