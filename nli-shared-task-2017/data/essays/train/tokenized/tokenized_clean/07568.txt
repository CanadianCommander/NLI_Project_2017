talking about the future is always a very difficult thing to do .so to decide wheter there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years one has to discuss several aspects that may influence this gesture .firs step , there is the definition of cars .if cars have to have an engine that uses fossial sources , i am sure that there will be fewer cars in the future , even when talking about such a short point in the future as twenty years .if also other sorts of powering a car are within this definition i will need some more steps .second step is the aspect of population .up to now the growing of the world s population is said to maintain the way it does .if that will still be true in twenty years we will definitely have fewer cars .as an example take vienna , the city i live in .roads and cars , and parkings spaces need that much space in the city , that the space for houses and people walking is limited .so if there are more people , i suppose they will need more space , and therefore this space has to be gained by abolishing , or at least deminuating roads .third step is to think of other sorts of transportation and their progress .undergrounds are already part of almost all big cities and their positive influence is obvious .if there is no negative trend , thinking of security within public places , caused by sustaining terror threats , this means of transport will have its effect to decrease the number of cars .trains also may become much more important than they are today .i suppose this since i think of the growing size of the suborbs .more people need more space , which results in longer distances to the working places , which have to be passed by faster .so if technology mangages to control higher speed and can ensure this by a higher security standard , trains will overtake the car s function for taking people from and to their working place .so as an conclusion i suppose that in twenty there will be fever cars than there are today , since at least on of the aspects above will become true .
