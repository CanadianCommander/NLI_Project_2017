i agree with hte statement because undrstanding ideas and concepts is alot better and easier than learning facts .because of many reasons .first understanding the idea make easier to remember and make memorible in their brains .for example , when i understand an idea about the `` earth movement  ican easy remember it later and explain it to another person .the second reason is if someone understand about a subject it will help him later in the future at work .for example , when we were children they tought u at school the basics of math then we understood it then know hoe to deal with big math problems nowadays .the third reason is a lot of subjects need to concentrate with it and understand it such as chimstry because with this subject you neded to understand the numbers the words so you ca nt just lesrn the `` facts  and if you did you make a mess .the fourth reason is , when you have an exam you will write the answer easily because you know it and biswade with it and it s stored in your head .on the other hand `` learning facts  is not to bad because some people are working with it works with them .but there is alot of problem with it but it can be a temprary situation then you can proceed to the better level wich it `` understanding  .and on of the problems with learning facts that it s not easy with math , chimstry and physics .so it wo nt help you with these subjects , but also works with history a lot .so there advanteges and disadvanteges with the both .bit if we put them in a scale we will see that the `` understanding ideas and concepts  is the winner style .
