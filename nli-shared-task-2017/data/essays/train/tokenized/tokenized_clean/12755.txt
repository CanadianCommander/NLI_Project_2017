in our country we have an old tradition in our education system .even if you are a primary class student or a university student you will experience the same : `` we like repeating words , lectures or whatever we told , without understanding the ideasfirst of all , history classes in the primary school , i remember our teacher told a lot about the war that took place between our country and a neigbour , however right now it is really difficult for me to remember the reason or the result of that war .because all we did was to repeat several times the reasons without understanding and get rid of this knowledge after the exam .another memory that also affected my life was passed in the high school .we had an exam on math .in the result of the examination i failed because i could nt remember the necassary formula .however my best friend who also forgot the formula passed because she also learned how to get the formula .nevertheless i am still failing in my works because i do nt know how to find the solution .in turkey we have a saying `` do nt catch a fish for someone but tell how to fishing  .as a result in my opinion it is really important to understand the idea than to learn the fact .
