i actually did nt get the question very well .i mean i could nt get what you mean by this , but i ll give a try .well , i totally agree the statement as understanding ideas and concepts are the key elements to undertsanding the facts .without giving the understanding of the concept one can never expect the students to the reasons behind the facts !i believe that it would be better for them to get the main topic first , before they actually get to know the facts .understanding the ideas and concepts would give students teh chance to analyze the facts .when the students simply learn the facts and do not enough understanding and the background information to think about the reality .the understanding of the ideas and the concepts will not only provide background information but also help students to create their own thoughts and comment on the given information .in the academic studies , students are introduced the theory first , and then they learn the facts .with the theorotical acknowledgement provided , they get the chance of the understanding .the ideas lying behind the theory and the meanings of the concept .after that , they re introduced to the facts , what really happens and why .they try to analyze the situation and detect the reasons why something specific has happened and why others have not .this clearly demonstrates the need of the understanding of the theorotical basis-filled with ideas and concepts right before the learning of the facts .the more they are familiar with the leading thoughts the easier it would be to understand the topic completely and accurately .although i m for the argument , i m also aware of the importance of learning the facts .one should of course eventually learn the facts .otherwise it would only be a brainstorm activity .applying the information provided in the theory part is crucial .as i said before , describing the ideas and concepts is really necessary , it would nt mean too much without the facts .in order to be able to find the answers to the questions you need to look at the results which are lying in the depths of the facts !consequently , there s no doubt that we need to face the truth at the end , it would be better to understand the ideas and the concepts that are very useful in understanding the facts .
