at school and university , students are asked to study an enormous range of different subjects .also the way students confront classes differ widely according to what they re being taught .some courses require that the students memorize facts ( e.g. , history classes ) , others try to develop students  particular skills ( e.g. computer science classes , sculpture classes ) , and in others students are asked to concentrate on particular abstract concepts ( e.g.philosophy classes ) .i therefore think that a successful method of studying depends on what is being studied and focused on .it is not possible to state whether it s more useful to understand ideas and concepts or learn facts , unless we consider what time of subjects is being taught .the topic of one subjects may be mainly factual , while in other classes the focus is on the discussion of concepts .if we take a cooking class for example , we see that both concepts and facts are important .we may want to learn where and why italian pizza was created , what the conditions of the land that concurred in its creation were , and why it is called pizza .but at the same time , because we re attending a cooking class , we want to know how to cook it .the ingredients that we need and the kind of manual work required are the basic elements in our lesson .so , in this case , both concepts and facts have the same importance , depending on the emphasis the teacher or student give to what they re examining ( in this case , the creation of a simple but successful food ) .this example demonstrates that there are more than just one way in which one could approach his/her subject of study .therefore giving more importance to one aspect ( fact ) rather than the other ( concept ) or viceversa is not a successful way to learn .
