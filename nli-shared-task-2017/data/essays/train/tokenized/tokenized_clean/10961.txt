i disagree with this because the thought does not exactly consider the situation of young people nowadays in the modern community .and really does not have support for its arguement .it will be acceptable if proposed that this is a general situation for all people but not for only young people .in the days we live life is getting harder for all , living is seem to be getting harder .people have certain needs to survive like food , house and such like things .moreover if the person is the only worker in the family and have kids she or he has more responsibility .despite this most of them really try to work harder to help their community aware of that if thair community does not exist this will also be the end of them and their children .as in my situation although people need to work to earn money for them and their family to live they spend all their energy to dig all the ground to live .but in such a bad condition too , they try to help others in the community .i have many friends that can run to help anybody that they do not even know before .a short time ago one my friends saw somebody shot in the middle of the street , after the voice and overcoming the shock he has he run to help the man who was shot .after his attempt everybody in the street came there to help .in such a dangerous situation too you can find more people than you aspected .they create groups and teams to participate in social works to help improving community .we have one of this teams .and in this group i have met many people full of desire to change to condition not only for them in a selfish way but also for their community and for the human being too spending a really much time for only those kind of things .this sentence has absolute judges does not mean sense to me .as having such experiences i can not accept this thought .
