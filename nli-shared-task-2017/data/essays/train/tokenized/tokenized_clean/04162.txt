i agree this opinion .i have three reasons about this .first , the age of communities is growing up .there are usually many older people in the communities with enlonging the mean age .older people have many witness , skills and cultures , so young people have to absorb it to heridate the new generation .indeed young people are difficult talk with older people because the interested thing are quites different .we have to get those things .second , it is safty to protect our communities themselves .the ratio of damaging by the thives could decrese with power of protecting themselves .in fact , it is possible to decrese it by walking around the communities at night .we are be too careful to close at doors and windows as possible as we can , but thieves are often appears .it is necessary to prevent from invading thieves with communities powers .finally , humans live with groups .we can not live alone .while young age , it is little opportunities to be helped by other people .if they need , they take a telepone some friends at long distance .they get not helps but opinions , we can put it off .
