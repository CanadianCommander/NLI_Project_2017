in the past , the educational system was designed so that students would learn the `` truth  .this means they would have to learn by heart all the capitals of the world and know all the important historical dates perfectly .with this methodology , it was common for a student to get hit in a classroom for not being able to do exactly what the teacher wanted .this concept of education is now days been reevaluated .the new way of teaching is much more productive .now the teacher tries to make the student understand the ideas behind the facts and not to repeat them like a parrot .for example , is does not make sense for someone to know exactly on what day and what time did all the important battles in world war ii took place , but to understand the historical situation that led them to occur .also , the teacher instead of hitting the student for not knowing , he encourage him to speak his mind on every subject .that way the discussions on the classroom are a lot more productive .the new system is more useful , in the sense that the person learn how to understand ideas , discuse them and take a position towards them .the student s opinion is given a lot of importance and so he will learn to think on its own and not believe everything he is told .in the future , when the student faces real life and will have to get a job , most information learned by heart will be unuseful .on the other hand , if he knows how to handle difficult situations and has an appropriate mental structure he will be able to do his job a lot better .this does not means that the students will not have to learn certain facts .every theory is , in some way , supported by facts and this should not be forgotten .personally i like the better system better .not only because this way is nicer attending to school , but beacuse it will help us prepare a lot better for life .although , as always , i think that we should not believe completely in a model or system , because there is not such thing as the perfect methodology .we should continue to learn and reevaluate our system whenever is necessary .
