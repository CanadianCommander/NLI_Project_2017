the purpose of traveling is to discover and explore more of what the world has to offer .it is a chance for someone to fulfil their curiosity and their imagination .there are many ways to travel and explore .someone may choose to travel alone or accompanied by a group .most of the time , the group is led by a tour guide who is an expert on the history , past , and sites of that specific area .other peole travel alone because they do not have a specific destination , and would rather explore at their own pace .i beleive that everyone has different interests , and that the standard tour will not necessarly satisfy everyone .i think that there are more benefits to traveling alone than traveling in a group , and being led by a tour guide .one of the major advantage is the fact that the person is able to solely visit the sites that he/she is interested in , and therefore is able to spend more time at that location as oppose to having to report at an other location that may be less interesting to him/her .i also think that everyone travels for a different reason .some travel to make research about an area or a subject that is fascinating to them , while others do not have a specific goal .traveling in group will not allow someone whose intention is to research to fulfill his needs .that person would need time to focus on his/her area of study without interruption or limitations .there may also be some difficulties when traveling alone .one of the most common one is that the tourist who is not familiar with the location may not be able to locate him/herself and find the historical sites .the history and information about each site that a tour guide provides may not be available .i personally disagree with the statement because i do not think that someone should limited when traveling .i think that before traveling , a person should make some research and familiarize him/herself with the area he / she will be visiting , and define his/her priority .no one knows what the world has to offer until all the possibilities have been explored .i also beleive that the true and best way to explore the world is alone .
