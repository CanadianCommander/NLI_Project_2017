some people believe that the number of the cars will decrease , while others do not think so .in my opinion , the total amounts of the cars will diminish largely because the people gradually realize that too many cars will cause serious problems .the first reason for my viewpoint lies in the fact that nowadays more and more importance and attentions have been attached to the problems cause by cars .for example , the cars caused the serious environmental problems like the air and water pollution .moreover , the cars cause too much noise which largely affect our sleeping and study .in addition , the increasing cars have used a relativley high rate of the precious oil on which our quotidian life and industry development depend .these detrimental problems brought about by the cars , if not handled in time properly , will lead to a series of severe consequences .luckly , we have seen a lot of endeavors and efforts to solve the problems of cars by both the government and public .for instance , the government has offered enough financial support for a lot of scientists to invent new vechiles .what s more , the media like the newspapers are trying their best to call for the public and the students to ride the buses to go to work .these efforts may be effective to decrease importance of the cars and reduce the total amounts of the cars in the future .of course , we should not ignore or underestimate the difficulties involved in the reducing the numbers of cars .the cars is one of the most effective and convinent way of trip .many people want to purchase a car because they want to work or go anywhere anytime .they will not be restricted by many outside factors .they may think the car as the status of the themselves in the society and do not take into account the cars in a pratical way .all in all , the issue about the cars is the a complex one that needs the analysis on the case-by-case basis , accordingly all three reasons mentioned above intertwine to form a whole organic becoming more persuasive that any of them .in the final analysis , though the danger of cars call more attentions increasingly , it is also important for us to change the feeling of the cars in the public  mind to reduce the nuymbers of the cars .
