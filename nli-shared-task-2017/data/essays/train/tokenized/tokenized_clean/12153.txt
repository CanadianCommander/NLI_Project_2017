young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i am disagree with the statement .generalization of young people absence in helping communities can not be made .community is a group of people who live together and share some commen base and solve problems of each other .it can be a small residential community where the people live , or can be a hostel dormatory in which student lives , or can be a hospital or a university .with time , societies grows , and communites within the socities also changes .this changes may be due to modernization .young peoples are part of communites , and if one says , due to modernization , young peoples are not much involved in communities , this is a wrong interpretation of the situtation .present conditions in society , has exposed young peoples to new challanges .they are getting bigger plateforms to develope their qualtites which are eventually helping the communities in more effective and innovative way .for example , there is a peasent boy , whose duty is to go with his father to the farm and grow crops .this definitly serves the community .but because of modern interaction and globalization , that illitrate peasent boy is exposed to new technology of agriculture , he will learn and improve his qualities .the learning might take time and may cease the direct involvement in the community in short , but in long run , being a educated talented farmer , he can give the time to the community by producting more effectively .today we can see young people in various position in the community itself .they are leading manufactures , they are docters , they are engineers , and even in the univerisites , there is large enhancement in the young people taking teacihng as a social proffesion .all these facts show the enthusiam of young people is helping each community in both direct and indirect manner .hence involvement of young people in communities has improved a lot in a effective manner .
