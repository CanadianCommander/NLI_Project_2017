although i can understand people , who think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , i think that speacializing in one specific subject is better .i want to point out my opinion with the following 3 arguments .first of all , in ancient time , the greeks and romans needed manz academic skills .for example , aristoteles was a philosophist , mathematic and a astrophologist .they needed these many specialisations to earn money .but since henry ford invented the construction band , the specialisation expanded .secondly , you have to be a genius to have a broad knowlodge of many academic subjects .for example students need three or four years to study only one academic subject .so it would cost the person a lot of time to get a broad knowledge .furthermore studies are not for free .the person would also need a lot of money , and this is not very effective , as he or she do nt earn a lot more money , when they start working .so in fact , you should study two things side by side .but this request a high iq , which only a few people have .last but not least , as mentioned in the beginning , specialisation is needed today in every work .today companies search for specialised workers in only one specific subject .the work does not require other academic subjects .so a person with a broad knowledge would propably be annoyed , doing this job .so the company will propably prefer the specialised worker .i study business , this is already a specialisation , but i have to pick out only one part of business .for example , controlling or finance management and when i work in a big company i even have to go deeper into specialisation in one aspect of controlling or finance managment .and by doing this i have to learn every day new things , so i will never have the time to learn other academic subjects .
