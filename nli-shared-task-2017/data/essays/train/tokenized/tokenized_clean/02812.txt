is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , or to have a more specific subject specialization ?first , i think that this question is quite difficult .in fact , in france we use to have plenty of different courses , therefore as we come at the age of about twenty , it appears to be a good thing .that is to say , i got a basic knowledge on a lot of different things , and i am capable to understand basic problems or discusions , for instance on radio .and i feel glad of it .but , of course , a broad knowledge has also got drawbacks .actually when i was a child , i thought it was a wast of time learning how human beings descovered fire , how dna functions .it is hard to interest somebody in a subject that is not its cup of tea .thereas a specific learning can really be a good way of catching attention .thus students , that just focuse on a specific problem , are really aware of it , and when time comes for them to work , they are efficient .i think that a reason of the american power , and the fact that often american searches recieve the nobel price .however , i believe that a good balance between a specific topic and a broad culture is the best .in france we generaly agree that americans do not even know where europe stands .i think it certainly is a prejudice , but it reviels may be that we can not just consider a single subject whitout considerating the world in which we all are .to conclude , i would say that a balance policy in teaching is almost impossible to find , but i do trust that both a broad view of the world suroundings us and a specific culture are a wounderful utopia .
