i do not think that traveling in a group lead by a tour idea is a great idea .while many would point to the benifits of having a seasoned , knowledgable resource who understands the lay of the land , the local language and is familiar with all the places and facts in the area , the idea of traveling in a tour group definitely does not appeal to me .my personal experiences have not been very good with tours led by tour guides .first , the guided tours try to squeeze as much in as possible and as such the schedules are very gruelling and tough and one does not get to enjoy the things one wants to do .it is not always easy to tailor a trip that suits everyone s requirements .human beings are different and have different preferences , for example someone interested in art may want to visit london only for its museums whereas someone else may prefer to go to london primarily for its fabulous shopping .it would be very difficult to tailor a tour that keeps both these interests at heart and the outcome maybe a combination which satisfies neither .secondly , there is always the factor of control and independence , an impulsive side trip or extended stay may not be an option on these tours .imagine being worn out from a trek up the hill to see a castle and not having the ability to turn back to go to the hotel because the tour bus has a schedule to see five more places .finally , there is the question of lodging and dining choices .individual tastes are very diverse and since its is very difficult to cater to the tastes of different individuals the tour guides may choose the least common denominator which again will leave many dissatisfied .to summarize i would not recommend guided tours as a way to travel on account of problems you may face due to the reasons highlighted above .
