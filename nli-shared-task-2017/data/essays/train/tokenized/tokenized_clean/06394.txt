i agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .i think that life is about risk taking and when you do not take risks you let opportunities pass you by .if you were bold enought to take the risk and you managed to accomplish it in a succesful way you will have gained a lot , yet if you did not accomplish it in an accurate way you still gained a lesson .doing what you already know how to do well is a convenient way of spending your life , yet by the time you are older you will realized that you could have made much more .by not taking risks you are sure that you will not have negative consequences but , you are also sure that you will not gain more that you have in that moment .it is well known that most of the discovers and inventions that build the theories we use today , were discovered by researches that took many risks .for example , say you are making a research project and you know from theory that by letting the variables unchanged you have big chances to get a certain result .if you continue with the experiment in this way , you will prove the result you expected , and will have a research project that proved something that was know before .this does not mean it is not valuable , on the contrary this type of research is also valuable since theories were made years ago and there may be some conditions today that can change the results .but what if you decide to change a variable and see what it happens , you might be discovering the cure for aids , for example .in cases like this , taking risks can lead you to succesful events .there is a mexican saying that states `` if you do not take risks you have less opportunities to win  .and it is quite true since by not taking risks you diminish your poll of opportunities .it is also true that taking risks do not guarantee , every time , a positive outcome it may in fact turn out to be a negative one ; yet you will not know what would happen until you try it .
