travling one of many things the poeple like to do it .each persone or group ( families or friends ) who travil togther has or have own way .one of these ways is travel in group led by a tour guid .i diagree with the people who do or like that for many reasons .first of all , always the tour guide has a specfic time to do his jop every day .if you miss the group you miss all think .one of my friend who tried this before he unhappy and advise me to do not take it all of my live .when he was in italy with the group .the people did not wake up in the morning and all days scuall was done .second , some of the tour guide give the people who wuold like to travil with them the deams vecation .the try to make the group begger and complite the seats and rooms withch they maed reasvitions .in addation , when you spend this days you see lots of diffrentces .then you understand them .thired , you can do all of activeties by your self with your friends or families .search on the internet ask people who visitted the please you would like to spend your vacetion .you will save many , time , and have privesy ( privet ) .we like the tour guide ads and programs .but still the travel with your group is the best .for all thes reasons i complitlly disagree with the people who do or like that .
