to become a more experienced a erudite person , one would have to have broad knowledge of many academics rather than just one .i strongly agree with the following statement : `` it s beter to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than t specialize in one specific subject  .for instance , a ballerina would be a more respectful and better artist if she only knew so much about physics .dancing has so much to do wth physics .in order to be able to lift herself in the air and rotate her body at a certain speed she would need to have had taken courses in physics .being more knowledgeable in so many accademics would increase her chances of success .i d have to say that a broader knowledge of many academics would be very similar to biology .in order to understand the human body you need to learn more about all the organisms instead of just focusing on one , and how they are linked to each other , also how they would benefit the system .that is why when one is studying biology in college , he or she would have to study for a certain amout of years about biology in general to find out how things link themselves and how they function all together .if this statement were incorrect then why would schools offer a variety in courses ?they might do so to prepare a student for life but in specializing in one specific subject they would have to be more ignorant of what is going on around him/her .it is essential that many gain a broader knowledge of many academic subjects thant to specialize in one specific subject because that much variety would lead to a better understand in other subjects .everything is linked together in space and in our society .if we were to specialize in one spefic domain we would have to leave out a great amount of interesting and intriguing information that would be very helpful in certan situations .considering the example of the ballerina .if she were to walk on the streets alone and suddenly she just fell and injured herself .and if no one were here to assist her then she would have to do it herself .in order to do so she would have had taken classes in health care or any courses that are similar to biology .if she does not cure her wounds then she would ruin her future .professional ballerinas are very concered about their health and their well being .`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one sepecific subject  because of how the word is linked together .they all the sensations are in the foot .to heal a person one would have to press on a certain location on a foot to stop the pain .
