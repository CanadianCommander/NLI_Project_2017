i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .many products have advertisements their paccage or poster in the street or shop .i have not see same thing about products and advertisements .first of all , we often see advertisements of new products at street or shop .the advertisements make us want to buy .i have a experience .this is abut shampoo .a certain country broadcasted cm about the new procucts of shampoo .this made me wanted to buy , because the woman s hair after used the shampoo is different it before used .actually , i used that , but my hair did nt change .also , we can say about foods .foods paccage looks delicious , so we want to buy it .however , we have situation that actually it is not delicious .the campanies that want to sell more products try to use good pictures and phrases .in couclusion , we have a right that can choose food or something to use .we should not credit the advertisements easily .sometimes we need to think more seriously about advertisements .in addition , we do nt have to forget that the advertisements is trap made by company to increase customers who buy the products .it is dangerous us to buy without thinking deeply about truth of foods .we should decide to buy more seriously .
