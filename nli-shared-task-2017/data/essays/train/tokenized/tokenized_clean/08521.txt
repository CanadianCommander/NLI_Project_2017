the understanding of both ideas and contents are important .there is therefore , a slight difference for me that makes one more important than the other .first of all when we learn about facts , whe are using our memory to get some info on somethig that works , exists and does not require any further experiments or resaerches .on the other hand , when students learn concepts and ideas , they may put them together with the pourpose of conducting some researches .when students are curious and have enough information , concepts and ideas ; the results of their experimets could lead them to get some facts by themselves .thomas edison for example did not have the fact about what light represented , he had lots of ideas and concepts as the result of his various researches .he was curious enogh to be able to put all these factors together ( curiosity , ideas , concepts ) to be able to make a wonderful , revolutionaty invention .an invention that created many everlasting facts .all the modern and the new school methods zero in on leading the student to the learning through his ideas and the curiosity these may generate on him .nowadays , i have also have the chance to test myself and put into practice all these methods .i am a person who likes learning through experiences and getting plenty of information by myself .achieving facts , or learning about facts on my own is important for me , but needless to say that all the existing facts you may learn about also give us abundant richness of concepts , ideas and kwoledge .in short , ideas , concepts and facts are all necessary , but what really makes the difference is how effective well - structured concepts can lead a student to a more self-exploratory environment .thank you .
