i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the reasons that i agree with it are that they can change the color of products to look better and they hide the bad points of their products .first , when the companies advertise their products , they always monitoring and editing the advertisements to make them nice .they also design the advertisements so that the products colors and shapes look better .however , if we see the goods in stores without fancy effects , they are less attractive than in advertisement .for example , in i-pod advertisement , they use fancy colors to make it cool , but it is just computer graphic .second , the companies know that what are the bad points of their products , so they hide it .in television , we ca nt figure out if they do nt show to us .we can do to the store and figure out that what is error of the products but still we can miss it .for example , some food restaurants put some chemical material , but they do nt tell the people that they put bad portions in foods .they always say these are chuicy and jucy , not fatty or harmful .thus , many companies make their goods look great to make money .they want to hire the person like as advertisements designer in order to make their products fancy .they also want creative person to create new strateges of their business .we know that they want to make money , so we must think and choose carefully when we buy our products .
