i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having a broad knowledge , it would help people find a better career and have a wide range of choices to choose from especially for students .having a broad knowledge of academic subjects , students will be able to choose a best fitting career for them .for example my friend always had great interest in geology , but had no such class in highschool and could nt find anyone to teach him in such area .soon he changed his interest to studying history .if he had more knowledge and a person to talk with about other subjects including geology , he could have been happier .specializing in only one subject , students might have a hard time finding a job if all the openings are filled with other experts .by then it would be too late to start studying for a different subject .of course it is not bad to be an expert in a subject .actually it is a brilliant thing .but i think it would be better if people were aware of alittle bit of everything than concentrating on a specific subject for exmaple studying in college , students should try to take many kinds of classes as possible to build information and then from the knowledge collected over the years , find a job that interests them most .i believe having broad knowledge about various subjects will also help us out with surviving on earth .there is a saying in korean , ` a frog in a well .a frog in a bottom of the well only sees the little circular sky , which is opened at the top and does nt relize what is happening beyond .the frog sees the little sky as everything on earth .i agree that people should have broad knowledge of subjects than specializing in one specific subject .
