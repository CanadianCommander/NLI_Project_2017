ecologists would say there has to be fewer cars in the future , in order to protect the environment .by the way , when the peak oil will be behind us ( and that may happen quite soon ) , we will not be able to use fuel-using cars any more .scientist are currently working on new cars , but they may be less productive .at any rate , we would have to change every car .maybe that would be a great opportunity to think our urban transports differently .actually , with the urbanisation ( which will never stop , as the populations rises ) , other ways of travelling are developped , like trains , underground . ..there are more and more trains , that go faster and faster .because of the urbanisation , it becomes also very difficult to drive in the city : between paris and its very near suburb , you need more than one hour to go to work morning and to come back home nights .people do not accept this situation any more .to let them prefer buses , the government decided to restrict some roads to buses only .at the end of the day , the bus is quicker than the car in many situations .nowadays , the basic customer still prefers his car to train or bus , as he likes his autonomy and freedom .but we can seriously think that he will change his mind .nevertheless , the car industry stays an important economic and research domain .countries like china , japan and india will certainly try to exploit this domain , since it is still essentially developped by western countries .thus , it is highly possible that , in the next twenty years , there will be quite more cars made up by these upcoming countries .furthermore , we may have to consider the probem differently in the various regions of the world : in america there are still some space .in developing countries like african ones , the problem of traffic does not exist neither .conversely , the implantation of more cars would assist the developpment of the country .to conclude , the diminution of the number of cars seems to be an evidence in western countries , mainly in big suburbs .the reasons are environmental and practical .nevertheless , some other regions may still see in cars a possibility of economic and basical developpment .
