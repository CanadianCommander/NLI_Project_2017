nowadays , our society is based on communication .not only , information , but also advertisement .in a newspaper , on television , food industry , banks , music , ... , all companies explain us why we should buy their own product and not the one of their opponent by using advertisement .this brings me to a topical issue , the accuracy of advertisement .some products often seem better than they really are .on the one hand , advertisement is mostly inaccurate .it shows you prepared meals that you just have to warm up and eat , that should be better than home made meals .it demonstrates that the new technology of mobile phones allows you to make a call and take a photograph . ..of course your old phone is not good any more !the number of examples is unlimited .it helps me to come the point that advertisers show us what they want .there might be a disadvantage of a new technology , but they do not mention it .the prepared meal shown in the tv spot might be a home made one before being frozen .as you do nt have the whole information , you are not really in a position to take a position .but it seems to the great majority of people that products are not as good in the real life .on the other hand , there are lots of controls done before the broadcasting of an advertisement .for instance , products that contain zero percent of fat are really fatless .but this does not mean that the product has a good taste .it just indicates that it has less fat than the product of another brand .the product seems much better on tv than in reality , paradoxically though , the advertisers has nt lied to the consumer .in other words , the product respects the characteristics announced in the advertisement but is still not as good as it seemed .to conclude , i have a mixed opinion about this question .advertisement often show images of the product .those images are mostly manipulated ones and show a better image of what we are going to buy than the reality .this brings us to believe that products appear better on television .but sometimes , the product shown is not displayed for its taste , but for some other qualities .those qualities can not be seen on a tv screen .in that matter , the advertisement is accurate .
