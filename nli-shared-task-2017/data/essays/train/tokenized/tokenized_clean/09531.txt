the most efficient method of learning cen be debatable but on one point all methods that were produced has the common feature of teaching the main ideas and concepts to students .if one learns the way , the process of problem solving , he can also create , introduce or experiment new solving methods or new solutions .for a student of architecture or design , if he can learn how to cope with the idea of design , including not stealing or not reproducing , he can manage create his own item and express it whether it is liked or not .he can have the courage if he learns the concept behind the designing process .in a social field , for example in sociology , the strudent s main aim is to learn the ideas and the concepts instead of the facts .the history behind the thinkers or the idea makers should be studied in order to understand the philosophy of these people .if a sociolog had learnt these main ideas he can also have a chance to make his own research with the available methods and introduce his own thoughts .unless a sociolgy student does not know the ideas and the concepts , just the facts does not mean anything alone and does not lead a student to an approvable research .for an engineer student the fact also means just the result of a problem but it has no meaning if he does not know the process of the experiment .the aim and the method of an experiment are the ideas and the concepts of engineering .the facts are like the results of any disicpline it is like a finished building .wheter it is a social science or an applied science the theories including ideas and concepts are the main bricks to be built first .instead of these bricks one can not hold a building even if it was built , depending on false structures .
