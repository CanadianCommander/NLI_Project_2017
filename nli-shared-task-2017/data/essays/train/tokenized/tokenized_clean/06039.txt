i disagree with the statement that says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are several reasons why i disagree .the first reason is that if students only learned the facts than they would not be as creative as the other students who actually understand ideas and concepts .people have the ability to think so that if they just learned the facts they might memorized the facts and not understanding .for example , i have experienced that situation .i studied for my test and not understanding but memorizing all the facts .so i could not think of anything outside of the box .i failed that test from that now i usually try to understand ideas and concepts .the second reason is that if you understand ideas and concepts you will eventually get the facts too .like i kind of said at the first paragraph , understanding helps you study more .it stays in your head longer and you will not forget easily .on the other hand , learning facts , you will forget easily because you just memorized it and did not understand .the third reason is that understanding ideas and concepts are the basic steps .if you want to use anything you have to understand ideas and concepts first .for example , if you want to use a computer you have to understand ideas and concepts of how to use it , like reading the direction .it is not just learning the facts .to sum up , i do not agree with the statement .i seriously think that the more important for students are to understand ideas and concepts and not just learn facts .i think that learning facts would help students for at the moment but not for the long run .
