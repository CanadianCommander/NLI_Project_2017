i agree that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learing facts .in our society , people study in school for long time and learn about lots of things such as math , english , science , and history .when we learn concepts or ideas of any courses in the school , we have hard time to remember concepts and facts because we do not understand ideas .i believe understanding ideas and concepts are important because we can remember longer than learning facts and easy to learn new studies .first , if we understand ideas and concepts , we can remember longer than learn facts .we learn processes or concepts before we learn facts because it is the easy way to understand .although many people learn facts , they can not remember for long time .for example , i am in anatomy class and the beginning of the year , i just memorized facts and i did not try to understand concepts ; i did not get good grades on my report card .but , after i got first report card , i tried to understand concepts and i got a good grade .understanding ideas is first step to get knowledge .second , in my opinion , .all studies that we learn in school connect to other studies in high school or college .after we graduate high school , we go to college for our dreams .if we understand concepts ; we can learn other things easily .for instance , my friend , she is college student and she stuided european history in her senior year and her major is art in college .she realized that the history connect to the art alot although they are not same kinds subjects .in addition , she thinks if we understand any concepts .they connect to the other studies ; it is easy to learn new things and get better understanding of studies .in my opinion , understanding concepts lead easy way to remember study and convenience way to study new study .i believe understanding is one of the most important concep of the education .
