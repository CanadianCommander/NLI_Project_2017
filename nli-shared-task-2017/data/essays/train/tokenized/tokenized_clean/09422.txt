in every summer , a lot of people go paris and visit many museums , and some of them just give a short look at every paints and sculptures .it s easier to travel in a group then travel by alone .it s , however , in doubt if this is the best way .traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .the rationale behind this is that this kind of travel will never satisfy personal interests and it donse nt have flexibility in schedule .the first reason why traveling by oneself is good is that a person can go and see what they want .unlike to touring in group , an individual can show specific interest on art or customs .to illustrate , a newspaper article shows that a culture of an country has a lot of things that needs about a year just to see what there is .thus , it s ridiculous to going through not participating on certain parts of an culture .secondly , taking a travel with nobody else allowes the flexibility in schedule .since it s hard to know of a region without visiting the place , a person may feel like to change the time they spent on certain city or country rather than going other place .according to an survey done in the airport , visitors who have nt come to a country before changed there perceptions they had before in many ways .in this sence , traveling alone gives benefits to understand the country more deeply by giving changes to a plan .to conclude , it is good to travel individually because seeing what they really want to see on a trip is important and allowes giving change in plan , even though there are good features of group traveling like time saving and being with a person who can speak languages foreign to a person .if you are planning to join in a group , think once again if i m giving up the opportunities to broaden my sight for a little convinience
