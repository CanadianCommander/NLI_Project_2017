with the increasing of instant communication , advertisements have become much popular .and nowadays most of the adverts are shown by tvs .these advertisements includes from very useful products to the products that cause regretfull days for customers .there are so many situations we are encountering today .how many of us rushed to a market to buy a very simple product that pulled us like a magnet ?it can be a pen or a hi-fi .it does nt matter .but there are many other products that do the same job like the adverted materials .and also , they can be much cheaper than the adverted one .but it does nt matter .once we are hypnotised with the advertisement on a tv channel , no one can make us buy the other crappy thing , or it seems like a crappy thing .so many feedbacks are made by the customers till today about lots of unsatisfactory things .and what is more ; these can be a material that was being advertised over media .i also encountered such problems .once i brought back a bad book that became very interesting for me with an advertisement before i bought it over internet .this was becouse of that shinny advertisement .if i had see the book in a store before , i would even never touch its cover with my precious fingers .it was just a game played over those easly effected customers who watch advertisements , like me .also , there are so many movies that we wanted to see them so much and jumped into the cinema saloon and running away with an incredible speed after the credits .even there are lots of people rushes to the exit door of the saloon during the movie breaks and never come back who ca nt resist .but as you think ; these movies had been advertised so successifully before the watchers spent their hard earned money .in conclusion , it is possible to show a product much more better than they really are with an advertisement .as this happens so much , especially nowadays , do nt buy a product or go to a cinema or even reserve a holiday before hearing some comments .dogcan bicakci .
