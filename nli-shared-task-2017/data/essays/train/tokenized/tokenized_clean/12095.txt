i disagree with the idea .i want to travel alone .i have 2 reasons for this idea .i do not have a lot of time to travel .also , i want to visit as much as the sight-seeing place i could go in limited time shedule .the first of all , i work for a company as a full time worker .i have the annual summer holiday .however , it is difficult to spare time for a trip .in this situation , i would prepare the travel before to go travel .that s why i do not need a tour guide in sight-seeing .i woud read , ask and resurch about this place where i am going to visit .i spend this tour guide fee for extra service at hotels or another service .in addition , my time to stay there is really limited .i do want to visit places which i really want to go .i can not control my shedule when i travel in a group .i will miss some of them if i go with the group tour .also i can focus on visiting when i am alone better than in a group .second , it is not free to move personaly .the tour guide is the controller in the grouop .also i can not change my sheule when we go in the group .i want to go where i want to go .that s why i would like to go travel alone .therefore , i prefer to travel alone better than a group with a proffesional guide .my time is limited so it is important .
