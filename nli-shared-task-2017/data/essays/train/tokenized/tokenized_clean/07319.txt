some people may think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .however i disagree the statement for two reasons .first , individual traveling is more interesting .scond , the tour guide is not always leads some good places .let me explane in detail .to begin with , backpacking is more interesting in travel .it is obvious that group tour is convenient , but i ca nt do myself in that case .and i ca nt improve a sense of independance .let s take my experience for an example .when i was sophmore , i had planed to travel to easten-asia .that is the first trip to out of korea , thus i was too confused everything such as making passport , reserving ticket and scheduling my trip to think the method using the traveling company .however i decided to do own my on .finally i traveled to thailand and gained valuable exprience .after that i can do it everything myself and improve a sense of self-help .in this sense a group tour is not the best wat to travel .next , some bad tour guides leads commercial place to make money rather than good place .in the past , people does nt go travel to other contry through the travel company .now , many peolple use tour-agency .thus there are so many side-effects .let s take my friend experience for an example .he traveled to baly with his wife for marrige tour .likwwise other people , he used a tour guide in travel .first day , the guide leads beautiful place in baly and gives interesting mentions he prepard .however the second day , the guide leads the coupple to a treasure shop and silver shop and explansed that these goods are most popular in this country and persuading him to buy the good .so he disappointed greatly .this shows that the guide is always good .in conclusion , a tour guide is not the best way to travel for the reasons that
