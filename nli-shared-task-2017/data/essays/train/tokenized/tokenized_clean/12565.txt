the question is if it is important for students to understand ideas aand concepts than it is for them to learn facts .for many classes or subject it is necessary to combine both that means learning facts and to understand ideads or models .according to a study many students prefer to understand the idea of the theory , because this is more useful in an exam .i think everybody have to understand an idea or concept because you can not write a good mark if you always learn some facts .most you must conclude to give an good response and not only list some facts .therefore it is very important to understand the topic or theme really .for instance , a student who studies mathematics he has to understand the algorithmus which is used to calculate something .for him is it not important to list only some facts , he has to think logical .otherwise in some classes it necessary to learn facts for a testpaper .if you do not learn this you would not pass the exam .i think only learning facts is not very important for your future .everybodey need it to collect life experience and therefore you have to understand what you are doing .when a student get started with work or a job many companies prefer such students who have a good general education and not only knowledge in their studies .mabe ssudents who learn only facts will forget it after a short time , but somebody who has it really understand will do not forget after the exam .additionally it is important to be satisfied with that what you .some students are not interessting in learning facts .everybody has its own method to learning or understanding something .a student of medicine has to learn more facts than a student of electronics .sometime it depends from the subject .for the last one it is very important to understand the function of condensator or transistor , but he can experiments in a lab and maybe understand the function of it .in conclusion , it is very important to combine both methods of preparing for a test .some facts a student have to learn but on the otherside he must understand what he is doing in the exam .in a job everbody train new concepts or maybe he can remember on that what he has leraned during his studies .
