during my study i learned a lot about advertisements .our professor always said that advertising should convince people to buy a product - but not just one time !this means that if the advertisement promises something the product does not have the customer will not buy the product again .moreover he will tell his friends about the negative experiences with this product so that his friends also will not buy it .years ago i would have totally agreed with the statement , but with this backround information i have to say that i have a different point of view .i think that most ads try persuade the customer to buy their product by showing them how the product can satisfy their needs .it is for sure that they do not show the negative points of the product - but i am of the opinion that nobody really would expect that .i believe that today customer know how to handle with advertisements .they know that they have to compare the product-specifications to make a proper decission .furthermore i think that not a single customer believes everything which is mentioned in an advertisement , because they know that everybody wants to sell their product .to sum it up in a nutshell > advertisement is to persuade customers and so they will just show the positiv points of their product - but i am convinced that those are nearly like the product is in reality .in addition to this all customer knew that they should not belive all the things they see on television , read in newspapers or hear on radio , because no product is perfect - even if they promise it .and , as i mentioned at the beginning > when an advertisment really promises something , that the product can not fulfil , customers will buy it just one time .and no one can afford to loose all customer after such a short time .
