i m agree with the statement .succesfull people risks , in their life , rather than the other people .normal people have nt risk in their life and they do nt like to try new things .to be a succesfull person , instead , you ca nt stop yourself to do what you already know , you have to be ambicious and you have to be ready to take some risk .the persons , that live their life like a movie , do nt do anything for change it .but the persons that know what they want and fight to obtein it , they have to take some risks .the strong of the life is in the risks and in the new things .we ve to try all the new thing but never forgot the old things .if you are a champion in a particulary sport you have to continue the practice everyday , but that do nt means that you have to do only your sport .the mind and the thought that the sky gave us are the most important weapon for the war of life .the ambicious person and the person that does nt stop himself is the person that will win in the future .the influence of television should be used to talk with the persons about this topic .the movies , the songs , even the literature should be used to teach at the children the importance of being ambicious and the importance of tring new things .the fear of the common person is the reaction of the other people ( friends or even parents ) if they fail their new experience .but it is nt a problem .if you do nt do anything , you ca nt fail .only who does something can fail .and the sad of a failure is like the kiss of a wife .so when you re sad for a filure in a new thing , you hold the hand of your wife a your smile will stais on .
