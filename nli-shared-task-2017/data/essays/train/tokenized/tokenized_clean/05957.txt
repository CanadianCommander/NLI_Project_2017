i disagree with the statement .young people have hard time loving their life because of the stage of adolescence .on the other hand , older people spend their lives as they want to because they are far more experienced than the young .i am a teenager , and i have seen a lot of my friends struggling in their lives because they do not know what they should be doing .also , this is the time of adolescence where many teenagers view the world differently from adults or children , and often become too emotional or revolting .for example , when i first enrolled in my high school , i was very depressed .this was because i kept believing that school was a place where young people my age were being measured by the grades that they received .as i kept thinking that this was a horrid idea of recognizing one individual as good or bad , i found anger in my self , and i could not enjoy my life .i also did not know what field i wanted to persue my career in , so i was very confused and pressured .i think this time of my life was a time of struggle because i was quite young and did not have enough experience in life to make important decisions .being young means learning about life and going through different emotions .young poeple suffer internally and this is why i believe that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people .my grandparents are one example of why i think that elders enjoy life more than that of the young ones .since my grandparents are both retired from their jobs , they have plenty of leisure time to spend .my grandparents travel every month to different places in the world .since they have earned enough money in their younger years , my grandparents are able to entertain themselves more than others .also , they have more life experience , which means that my grandparents are able to figure out what is the most fun and benefitial to themselves .like this , i believe that older people can live a free life , doing whatever takes them to be happy .young people often have to go through difficulties in their lives , such as finding their true talent , peer pressure and worries on how they will survive in the `` real  world .on the other hand , older people can live a relaxed life doing what they find the most joy in .they also have more experience in living , so they are wiser and know what is best for them .therefore , i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people .
