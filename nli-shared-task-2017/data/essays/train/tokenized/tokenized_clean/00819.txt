i strongly belive success requires to try new things and take risk in the life .everyday is first day of rest of our life and can be a new refreshing start .a new start / change gives more energy to accomplish .as we all know ; all methods and ways change by the time .even the way we think , we see the world need to be changed as well .the way people travelled , dressed has been continiously changed over years .the way govermenst admimistrates , companies advertises changed as well .even today war strategies changed .keeping same way and insisting in doing things old fasion way can not be a key for success .we were not burn as a fully experienced educated person .during life or school we continously learn and experience things .one time things we thougt was best to do may not be right to do later .even the the right things we have been doing may not be best to do an other time .i exprienced these from my own life .i worked as a pizza maker for 3 years in the past .i was a good professional pizza maker but i was not happy with may job and never felt i was successful .i never thought it was right for my caracther and abilities .i wanted do a different job have more action involved .i took risk of changing my job and established a company .now i sell overseas and earn lots of money .i go different part of the world and do different things every day .i feel more happy and successful .successful is the level of life makes you happy .if you dont feel happy with what you have or what you are doing you should take risk and change it .
