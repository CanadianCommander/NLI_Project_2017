considering the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  , i feel that the statement would be much better changing it to the past .the way we live now and the way we will be living in the future may change .we know that science has developed a lot and everyone is aware of the recent developments .vehicles which are running on the fuel ( petrol ) now , may not work on the same grid .latest inventions like electric , hydrogen cars have come into existence .many facilities like charging points availability in the petrol bunks is done .this rapid growth results in the much more invention and development .people who go for the economic and best , will be sure of purchasing these sort of cars .since initial purchasing amount will be quite low , where maintainence cost is lowered , with cheap recharging of the engine at near by locations .people generally have awareness of the pollution in the future and have concern towards it .so opting these cars is favourable and helping .comparing the past , present and future , we know the olden days cars were very expensive .but now many people could buy them .since the cars which run on electric charging were cheap , people will be buying them too .infact we may see the increase in cars in the future due to this reason .hence , even though the number of cars have increased , they are not creating the pollution problem .the statement mentioned will go well with the past circumstances , not with the future .
