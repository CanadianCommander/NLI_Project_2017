this world is dazzling , various yet institutionalized .some compays use advertisements to illustrate and attract customers to buy their product .however , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in order to get people s attention , advertisements always use some special cases which might not be suitable for every samples .comercially , it is the primary goal to get the benifity , wich make the experiment results showing in advertisements are more like a story instead of an academic strictly paper report .some advisements will even provide inaccurate experiment data in their product and bambast for them .this situation is much more serious in most of asian countries because of their goverment s careless attitude for popular media .take one notorious case for example , chai-ca , one of famous communication ic design campanys in taiwan have ever proposed a cell phone called nan-chi .in the beginning , nan-chi was so popular because that the advertisement meantioned it can still work in some rural areas even the density of signal base is sparse .however , that kind of assumption will only work in east part of taiwan because of the specail reason .in conclusion , i highly aggree with the statement that most advertisements will make products seem much better than what they really are in view of the advertisement i have ever watched .and it is really necessary for goverments to face , handle and make the related law to this probelm .
