will we success if we always make a decision through the old way ?in my opinions , this is a quit clealy answer .i believed that if we want to creative a really achivement , we have to make change that s for sure .if someone wants to be successful , he or she must have the characters bellow : first of all , old things wo nt attract people .for instance , we wo nt buy another product for their same function or appear .we will purchase something because of its newest and fleshest nomatter in any aspects .in addition , ability in make a right decision is a key to success .the differents between the leader and members is determine alility .it is obvious to look their position in salary .leader were the one got the high payment in a job .finally , the most important character in successful people is a precisely foresee .this is the heart for a person who will earn the respect and acomplishment .those people always saw the opportunities we will never see and seize this adventage to make a big profits and large benefit .to sum up , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because they have the talents or abilities to convince people to join with them , make the right decision without pain as well , and saw the chances advence .
