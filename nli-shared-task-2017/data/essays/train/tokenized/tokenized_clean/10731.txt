well i actually agree with this statement .i will explain briefly some of the personal conclusions that led me to think this way .the first one has to do with environment .almost every person in the world knows that the gases produced by cars are damaging our environment .they are a lot of arguments to sustain this idea but one of the most important is the destruction of the ozone layer .this terrible problem explains the appearance of many groups and individuals that are protesting and trying to change the rules of governments and the habitudes of world population .because of the concern of these organisations and many individuals and under the advise of many , many scientist some world leaders are engaged in this fighting , trying to avoid the world temperature to grow too much and attain certain levels .one of the consequences is that governments are trying to promote the common transport .for everyone having a car becomes more and more difficult .you have to pay a great deal of money to get your car insurance , you have to pay for parking in the streets of many towns all around the world ( london , madrid , paris . .. ) ...another important point is the decrease of world oil reserves .the experts calculate that in about a hundred or two hundred years oil reserves will almost dissapear .a lot of studies are being conducted to try to find a material to sustitute oil .the findings are really amazing but for the moment they didn  t find an appropriate substitute .well they tell us so .many people think that there must be many substitutes for oil but that oil and car companies does not want to promote these ones because of the money .if these inventions see the light and prove to be good it will affect the market share held by these firms and in the future it can take to their complete dissapearance .
