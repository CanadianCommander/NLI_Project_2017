in my opinion , traveling world with group led by a tour guide is a waste of time and money .first of all , while they give you time to explore places , it s a time very short time , so you miss out on lots of things that is necessary .secondly , crumped in a bus that drives for hours and hours without knowing anybody or anywhere just is nt a fun thing to do .finally , some tour guides do nt even know what they are talking about , and do nt talk when they are suppose to , so you have to take risks on picking the right time and date .let s say that you went to an university of harvard , and they have lots to see like the science center , and famous people who graduated in that place like bill gates .so the tour guides tell you to explore places within half an hour which is a very short period of time in such a large place .so while you are looking at unnecessary things , time goes by , and you miss out on the importants things like the golden statue .also if you do nt make it in time for the bus , they all complain about waiting for you eventhough it is just for a minute .eventhough , you go to places with your family or friends , they have lots of other people in the bus who is traveling with you .you could get bored only by talking to your family members or your friends .but some people do nt care , because they also have tv s in the bus to entertain you , but it only entertains me a bit .then all you here is chattering going on and on beside you and infront of you .you ca nt tell them to be quite , because they will point fingers at you and even curse you .the other things are that if you want to sleep , and lean back your chair a bit , they complain to you how unfortable it is which is very annoying .the great wall of china .it has lots of history and legens to it .surely , people want to know about it , but the tour guide does nt even say a word about it , and even he talks aloud , he does nt know what he is saying .well i am not saying that every tour guide acts like that , but if you pick the wrong time and date , you must face the consequences .therefor , i disagree with the statement .first of all , the tour guide do nt give you the right timing for you to explore place .secondly , you barely know anybody in the bus except for people who came with you , and finally the tour guide would stink if you picked the wrong bus .
