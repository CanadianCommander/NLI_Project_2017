it may be a rel problem , if young people do not feel responsible for their social environment .but it remains the question , if this is really the fact .one might think , that teenagers only want to spend a good time , and therefore they tend to neglegt their social tasks , which everybody who lives in a society has to fulfill .they are to much occupied in having fun with some friends or lerning for school or univesity .therefore it would be important to give more incentives or commitements to the young people to help their communities .but in my opinion this is not the fact at all .i think that there are several ways somebody can contribute to a community and i think a lot of youg people do so .this is because there are some activities which are likely to be made , that means there are cases , where helping is nt only work , but instead of this also a lot of fun .thus , helping in the community can sometimes be seen as a hobby , where one can gather experience for his life .it is also possible to meet some friends while working , or also to get to know new friends .as an example , i would think about the work in the teenage section of a political party .on the one hand the positve work of such groups indicate a benefit for the community , on the other hand it is also a great opportunity to lern about the life .so for interested teenagers , this is a good option , which is nt only theoretical , but can also be found in the reality .furthermore , there are several young people who start as trainers in the local sports teams .it is often the case , that they do this , because there is a younger family member in a team , which they want to support , but obviously they thereby help others as well .in cases like this , one teenager can follow his own hobby and by the way he is able to do a good job either in the family and the society .of course one has to be aware of the fact , that although there is plenty of kids who help in their community , there are always some others who do nothing like that .but i think it is unfair to say that everbody spends too less time for helping others , because it s always worth mentioning the helpful ones as well .and of course there are lot of teenagers like that .
