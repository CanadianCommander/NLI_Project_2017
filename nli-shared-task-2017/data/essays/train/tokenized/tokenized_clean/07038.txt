have you ever dreamed of going back to the past when you could enjoy as much as you wanted ?the older you are , the less interesting your life might be .do you know why a lot of people are eager to be yeonger although our lifetime remarkably went up ?we are all dreaming of the happiest moment of my lifetime .just because you are younger than others , it does nt mean that you enjoy life more than older people do .still , i take it for granted that there are more chances for younger people to enjoy life because they have more time to meet friends .besides , they do nt have as many experiences as older people do .younger people can enjoy something jolly with people whom they like .although most of them go to school , there are also so many freinds as well as fellow in the school , whereas it s extremely difficult for older poeple to gather their pals because each of them has thier job .they should make money to take care of their beloved family who can be much more important than friends .on the other hand , younger people can go to the bar , club , concert and their chun s house .no matter how much time they have , they can meet their friends whenever they want .next , they have less experiences than older people do .it is one of tremendous advantages .they can do something that old people regard as something boring because it could be something special and uninitiated for them .for examples , hard trip is pretty pleasing for them because it s not only something new , but they can also undergo new and precious expriences .personally , i was allowed to go to south-east asia at first becuase my parents think it can be absolutely hard and dangerous , but it was very attractive and gay for me to go there .i could go there after i had been allowed to go there in the end .i have never gone though such fantastic things .if i had been older and less active , i could nt have undergone .in conclusion , yeonger people enjoy our lifetime more than older people .they can do anything they want with their friend , and they can even enjoy something of which older people are already sick .that s why i alleged affirm that younger people have more opportunities as well as time to enjoy themselves as far as i m concerned
