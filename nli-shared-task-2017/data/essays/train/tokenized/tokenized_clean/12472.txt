it is reasonable that it can be helpful to travel in a group by a tour guide .if we used a group tour giuide service to travel , we could easily connect with a way to travel .however , i disagree this statement on the ground that to travel alone or with close persons is more meaningful to traveler .admittedly , to travel with tour guide is the way to travel easily .a tour guide serves to assist traveler .a tour guides have an effort to have an reservation about ticketing and traffics and they list somewhere travelers to go .also , tour guides know more about travel region than traveler .they explain about the travel region professionally .these facts reveal needs of a tour guide .however , the virtue of travel is achieve the knowlege of a travel region by himself or herself .the point of traveling is to achieve a character of the region and to understanding as well as to visit the region .also , if the travelers searched and got the information of travel region , the information would be remain very long time .these informations will be helpful to live .besides , travelers without a tour guide have a choice to travel where and when they want .they do nt need to visit region they do nt want and they can plan to follow their wanting by themselves .on balance , tour guide in traveling is helpful to travel .however , to travel without a tour guide has a great advantage .to travel himself or herself make achieve informations about the traveling region and have a choise to travel .therefore to travel themselves is meaningful to travel .
