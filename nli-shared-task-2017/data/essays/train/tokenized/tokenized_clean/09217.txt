the issue statement is youngpoeople are now days do not give enough time to helping their communities .this is an important topic .i agree the given statement that young people did nt have enough time to help their communities .because their are busy with their works and studies .now a days we are seeing the competitive world how the ccompition is going on in every thing and especially in the studies .people are unable to enable to tackle it .they even have no time to sleep .they are totally stressed from morning toevening with their busy schedule .to day young people doesnt have no enough time to eat and sleep .because we have to get up early in the morning and we have to think over our studies from morning onwards .parents are forcing them to do several things which they are not interested .either it may be in studies are another thing .their are getting totally tensed that they are not fullfilling the parents goals .they are toatlly stressed form all of them .no time to think any body just they are doing therir work and finishing the fullfillnness of their parents .secondly , i want to say that young people are diverting their thinking in other way by seeing different things likemovies which they want to be in that passion .they are smoking , bruzing and they are neglecting their health by this things .andthey arenot concentration their studies and behaving rudely with other .so where is the time to think other communitis to them .another more ican tell you that day by day the helping nature is decreasing in our world .it has many reasons .so , i think it may due to more population and jelsy in thepeople .we are seeing that we are not helping eachother especially in ourfamily when they are enable to solvetheir problem imean they are in any risk .finally i want to conclude that young have no enough time to think for helping their communities .ultimately i feel that they are totally concentrating their future goals which they want to get succeed .
