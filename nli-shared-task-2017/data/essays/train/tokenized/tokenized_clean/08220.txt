i disagree with the statement and believe that specializing in one specific subject and being a master of that area is much better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in today s complex world , each field or subject has become so complex that it requires more than a lifetime of dedicated effort to master that subject .unless one gives that effort , his knowledge about that field remains only superficial .specilization leads on to new frontiers .unless we have specialists in various fields , it will be very difficult to come up with new discoveries and inventions .each academic field has become so complex , it his highly improbable for a generalist today to come out with something new unless aided by chance or luck .specialization also leads to confidence in one s personality .if somebody is a specialist in his field , that person can be trusted to do that thing better than most people .he can be expected to take responsibility related to that field , so that other people can focus on their own specialist fields .since a specialist is a master of his domain , he can pass on that information gained by investing time in one particular thing to the next generation .a generalist wont have the depth and would not be appreciated by his audience when he talks about any of his various known topics .there is no course in the world which gives degrees to students for having studied about 20 different fields .all the degrees offered by colleges all over the world focus on one or two areas of specialization .this itself proves the worth of specialization viz a viz general knowledge about various academic fields .if one looks around , almost all the successful people are masters in their domain .they know about one subject in detail and hence gain respect from their peers .even a generalist post like the president of india is occupied today by a scientist who helped the country further its satellite program .there is a saying which goes like : `` jack of all trades , and master of none  .unless we change it to `` master on one  or `` master of some  , it will continue to remain derogatory in its usage .
