this statement does not offer a definition of `` successful  - unless success consists solely of doing new things and taking risks regardless of wether or not one succeeds in these new things and risks .this is to be doubted .trying to find out if i can fly makes me daring , and probably a hopital inmate at the least , but not successful .therefore , i would have to disgree on a formal level .more importantly though , i would like to challenge this statement in regard to its meaning as well .by not offering a definition of what `` success  means , the sentence is not only malformed , but furthermore appeals to a kind of common sense universality .immanual kant proved that the only maxims that may be universal imperatives or truths must be rationally applicable to any thinking being .if we now try to formulate this statement as a maxim - that is : if you want to be successful , you have to try new things and take risks - and see if it holds true for any given rational being - let us say immanual kant - we find that it is false : immanual kant lived in the same city his whole life , never changing any of his habits ; he positively did not take any risks regarding his work either : he worked an entire decade on his major book before publishing it , just to be on the safe side .but immanual kant is undoubtedly one , if not the most successful philosopher in history .his speculation on maxims can help us further along in solving the question of success : if a maxim can not be proved universal , its scope needs to be smaller .thus , if we enhance the statement by saying that people who try new things are successful if trying new things is important to them , we end up with an applicable maxim .as a conclusion , i would like to suggest that a more appropriate statement on successful people would be the following :successful people do what is important to them , rather than doing what they think they are supposed to do .
