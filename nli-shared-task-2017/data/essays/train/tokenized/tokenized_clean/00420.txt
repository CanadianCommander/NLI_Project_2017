i do agree with the statement that it is very much important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .let s take a common example of a student listening to a science lecture .it s very much important for him to understand what is dealt about before forming an opinion on the topic .if the lecturer just put the facts infront and ask him to byheart them it wud be of no use .the student might forget those facts after sometime as that do not create a strong impression in mind .but rather if he understands the ideas and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chance he can remember that for a longer time .another important aspect is that just learning the facts would not lead to the development of the subject .it s only when one gets a thourough idea of the complexities involved in that , one would get an idea of how to develop the concepts .for example let us take a student doing his project work on developing automobile efficiency .unless he knows what are the factors involved in developing efficiency he can not succeed .it involves the student to learn the ideas and concepts behind the subject apart from learning the facts .in most of the cases it s proven that false understanding of a subject would lead to an irrepairable situation .and knowing the facts without probing into them always leads to a false conclusion .secondly probing into the facts and understanding them also helps a student on a personal front .in one s daly life one may come across many complex situations , which if one considers only the facts might land oneself into trouble .let s take an example of a student getting angry on his father for not providing him more pocket money .the father would not give more money as he perhaps feel that his son is involving in illegal activities .the student should probe why his father s not giving him the money rather that to blame
