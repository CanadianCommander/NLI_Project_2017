by virtue of this text , i would like to express my opinions regarding the given subject .as a student in research , i consider this question mind-boggling to say the least .for years now , people have been debating on the subject in an attempt to decide whether students should learn fundamental or pragmatic knowledge .moreover , institutions are also pondering the issue ; wondering what is the true essence of learning and mandate of scholar institutions .considering my experience as a student for almost 16 years now , i truly believe that the learning of concepts and facts are tantamount in importance .as for many things in life , homeostasis between elements is always the essential resolution in case of doubts .somehow , both are crucials to the attainment of a solid education and mental representations of knowledge .on one hand , learn facted served as an empircal visualisation of our realm ; on the other , concepts and ideas help us to conceptualize the invisible such as the atom or the creation of distant galaxies .it is my profound impression that one can not appreciate the richness of reality and a deep phenomenological experience without both perspectives .to illustraste my point , i could use the analogy of a student wishing to comprehend psychology .it is in my opinion pretty simple to know as a fact that self-esteem is an important key indregient in child development .but in itself , self-esteem doesn < t exist as tangible matter , only its mere conceptualisation guide us in knowing one particular phenomenon .therefore , when we look at it we can observe a fantastic process happening before our eyes .our conceptualisations help us identifying new phenomenon which in return , help us to establish new facts .thus , when we consider education as a way for students to be competent and autonomous we inescapably have to promote the acquisition of both through the learning of facts and concepts .
