i am not really agree with the question .in a first view it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .they take all their life with a smile on their face , they are happy for all thinks also for a stupid thinks .young people have not a problem , they depend of their family , their parent , they are `` on the clouds  .young people enjoy themselves with the major stupid thinks , for example i have a brother that is 20 years old and he with him frinds laught for all thinks , they enjoy with videogames , they spend all day play football or gooing away .but the difference about the older people is not that the older people do not enjoy life , they also enjoy life but in a different way .older people have a big thinks to resolve , they have a responsability of their home , they must pay the telefone , they must cook the dinner also for their children that could be outside playing with their friends .older people have less time than the young people have .they have all day full , they can not enjoy life if not during week_end and also they have a different way to enjoy their life .when you are old , after 22 years old , you look to life in a different way than when you were 16 years old .you have a different way to enjoy life .for example now i am 23 years old and i like to do different thinks from 5 years ago .i enjoy my life going to mountain and looking with my boyfriend the landscape or to go to eat , in a famous restaurant , some good fish drinking a good vine .so i think that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i think that cahnge the way in which young people and the other do that .
