due to better possibilities of communicating and optimized wazs of transport , in the last century a process took place that incorporated the world : the globalization .one result of the globilazation is the increasing advertisements for products all over the world .on the one hand advertisement helps us to inform about products .but on the other hand you have to ask yourself if this process of advertising is really neutral ?and in my opinion the answer is no .when you watch tv , you can see beautiful cars driving through the landscape and beautiful womans sitting in it and enjoying it .but the question is if you also will enjoy to ride this car ?when you go to cinema you see several advertisements for films that are promised to be exciting .but again there | s the question : is it really that exciting when you see the whole film by yourself ?there are cases that confirm that the promises become true .but in my opinion , in the most cases you will be disappointed of the product you decided to pay for .the globalization certainly has positive effects on the world if you just think of the possibility to convey products or information .but in my opinion it causes that quality isn | t anymore guaranteed in every case .let | s take the example of the advertisement for the car .in tv you saw the car with all the beautiful impressions and it | s great equipment .but you | re not able to judge the quality of the car by only seeing it .so you may be dissappointed when you actually buy the car .this is a typical example of the thesis that advertisements make products seem much better than they are .in earlier times , you offered someone a service or a product and what you got back was also a service or prducts .this was the process of exchanging things directly .and you there you were able to judge quality .but the globalization caused competetion .and competition causes lies , so that the products seem better than they actually are .because of the increasing competition between big companies , the promises become better and better , the quality of products instead becomes worse because of mass production .so you can definitely say , that , not in all cases , but most of the time advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .and in this case the question i asked at the beginning of this text is answered : globalization does not have only positive effects .
