travelling is an activity that most individuals enjoy , may it be for its adventurous quality , innate curiosity for the unknown or the joy of simply having a relaxing vacation .this leads to the next question : is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ?personally , i believe the response to this question depends on the individual , his or her expectations and above all , the opportunity costs that this person is willing to take .travelling with a tour guide can imply a series of opportunity costs that some people are unaware of , such as the beauty of the adventure and the immersion in the culture .on one side , travelling with a tour guide has its pros .for instance , if there is a limited time to travel this can be efficient , less expensive and in essence the most importante places will be visited .there is no uncertainty as to where to go , what to do or how to plan the day .it simply is relaxing and enjoying your time .however , there are a series of opportunity costs inherent in this decision .for starters , who says that the tour guide will be fun ?a couple months ago i travelled to macchu picchu with two friends ; we backpacked .it was an amazing experience because the spontaneity , the adventurous nature of the experience and above all the liberty to do what we wanted was truly priceless .not only did we meet a series of travellers along the way , but we also got to immerse ourselves in the culture .i have to say this has been one of the best trips i have taken in my life ; i would truly recommend anyone to be brave , take a risk and enjoy the beauty of true travel .from personal experience i have to say that travelling without a tour guide is the best way to go .it is important to go informed , but even the getting lost and not knowing where to go form part of the magical experiences of travel .
