nowadays young generations are involved in a lot of activities , which absorb all their energy .these activities can range from something related to their studies , to something completely different as sports .all of them , however , are really demanding , and , therefore , they have to choose what to do .besides that , nowadays all young people like me are more interested in themselves , and in what they have to do in order to increase the number of skills they have , rather than in what other people are doing .this is also related to our society which is becoming more and more individualistic .all these things lead the young generations not to take care of the needs of other people , and , therefore , not to help them .this is what i experienced few days ago .i was walking with some friends of mine in one of the main streets in the city center of frankfurt , and , all of a sudden , a poor joung guy came to us asking for money .he stated he was very poor as his father lost his job , and , therefore , his family did not even have the money to buy some food .i felt very sad and i tried to give him some money .i am not rich , but when it comes to help someone , who is less lucky than me , i usually try to do it .on the contrary , the other young people who were with me did not even look at him and just passed by .they did not even took care .it was unbeliavable .they told me that , as they are working hard every day and have to face a lot of problems at work , they do not see the point in helping someone who is not trying , as they do , to work hard and improve their life .this is only a small example , but i personally believe that nowadays we have no time and aver all we are not anymore , as in the past , willing to help one another .this can also be seen in the decreasing number of young people who do not anymore take part in social activities within their community .
