in my opinion it is better and gives you more advantages having broad knowledge of several academic subjects than specializing in only one subject .this can also be seen in daily life : it s always good to have common knowledge .to have a wide information pool can connects the single knowledge of each subject .this gives a good way how to manage problems and solutions in a certain subject .for example in my study electrical engineering and information technolgy , if you have knowledge in a subject image processing you gain more advantages in mastering the other subject computer vision since the two subject share paralle and almost same information .that means by a broad knowledge the single information of each subject completes each other .that way you , the knowledge holder , have different aspects and views how to solve a problem as an engineer .nowadays it is really essential to have an interdiscipline knowledge as a researcher .the classical thought of having one product in only a specialzised subject region is not up to date .as a researcher or engineer you might have to provide a solid interdiscipline knowledge basis in order to do work out your research or doing your job .taking medical engineering for instance , this subject for its own consists of several other subjects : you need to have knowledge about medical parts and engineering aspects as well .e.g. in order to procede minimal-invasive operations as a doctor you must not only know the way how a human body works , you also need the knowledge how to manage those surgical instruments like a laparoscope , endostitches etc .last but not least by having a wide knowledge information pool you can work out problems as well in a team build up of different researchers .for example , the team with people having wider informations on different topics and subjects can better communicate with each other since the interfaces between them is provided by having a broad knowledge .that way communication problems concerning stuffs from different nature can be handled easier than not having those interfaces .for me as a result of those mentioned facts i think to have a broad knowledge is very crucial nowadays in order to competete with others researchers and mostly to interact with them easier .
