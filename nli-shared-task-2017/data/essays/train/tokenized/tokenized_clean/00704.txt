quite often management gurus thrust an age old aphorism , `` it s better to be a jack of all trades , than a master of one  .ofcourse , specialization is indeed beneficial , however , what s needed to succeed in this cut-throat competitive world is not just depth but breadth of knowledge .from my perspective , a broader knowledge base of many subjects is what i call for and agree with the statement .if seen in the corporate context , a typical manager is required to know not just about his immediate area of interest or work , but also about the work assigned to colleagues and sub-ordinates alike .for example , a building contractor , today is not just responsible for overseeing the construction part but also various other aspects such as dealing with artisans , wood craftsmen , masons , architect and many other such people , so as to accomplish the set goals wihin the stipulated timeframe .moreover , today students at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activities .why ?because , this inevitably involves growth and development and better and broader learning opportunities .gone are the times , when parents insited their kids on becoming a gynaecologist or a paediatrist or an optometrist and started grooming them at a very young age .medicals schools today churn out more general physicians than cardiologists and experts in other medical fields .admittedly , specialization in such fields in the form of masters is indeed imperative , however , that happens mostly for a purpose of a job or a career to start with .furthermore , as people grow , learn and develop , a variety of skills will be needed to cope with abundant and rapidly changing knowledege and information , especially in this information age .a broader skill base , is what even professional organizations ask for .for them , it s all a win-win situation in terms of more skills , responsibility and work load in the same cost as for a specialized person .a ceo or an entrepreneur would nt have been what they are if they concentrated just on their area of expertise .they are master strategists , skilled in various business aspects - finance , accounts , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in b-schools ) .in sum , a general perspective and view of things and subjects is required in current scenario .people with broad knowledge are more likely to succeed than the ones with a specialization .
