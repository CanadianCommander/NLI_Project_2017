learing a fact , we ( human ) are always curious about knowing a fact .we whant know what happning , what was a result .i disagree with the statement that student learning facts is more important than learning concepts and understand ideas .first of all , the reason why i disagree with the statement is because i strongly believes that understanding ideas and concepts leads to develope students thinking skills .specifically , if a teacher teaches about the global warming , and say just a fact of it ( like `` global warming is progressing now badly , and the earth s temperature is increasing .then how student will take that teachers voice ?most student will understand that the global warming is happning , but they could not know what elements are causeing the global warming , because that teacher only did teach a fact ( global warming is happning ) and did not teach how and whyhappend ( ideas/concept of global warming ) .therefore due to a lack of key ideas and concept of global warming , students only knew about a fact and they do not understanding process ( ieas/concept ) of the global warming .only knowing the fact is a big problem , because if they do not have inside story ( ideas/concept ) and only knowing the fact .then they could not evaluate the issue from there , becuaes they do not have data to estimate the issue .so , if they only knew about the fact , then they could not solve the global warming issues or other issues which happning on the earth .from above reason , i disagree whith the statement that teaching student facts is more important than teaching ideas and concepts .more over , teaching only fact is not ideal educational way .to develop students thinking skills , educator must teach ideas and concepts of each issues to develop students thinking ability .
