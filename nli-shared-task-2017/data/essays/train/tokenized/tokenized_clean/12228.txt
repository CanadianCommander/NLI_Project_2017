the days when one could be genericly called and a scientist or an inventor who knew it all are long gone .like leonardo da vinci was a painter a mechanic a biologist among many other things .in our modern times there is so much knowledge that one lifetime of constant memorizing will not suffice to acquire it all .technology and science advances as people contribute to it , and to be able to contribute to it one must have mastered what has been previously done .todays academic subjects are very deep and extensive .in addition , considering that there are a lot of subjects , a superficial broad approach will not lead to significant contributions .although it is mandatory to have a borad understanding of things to be able to relate ones work with other areas and find uses for it .failing to have awareness of other subjects can be considered as ignorance , but this kind of attitude and lack of interest has no place in academics .broader knowledge will get you in to many plesant converstions and you may be able to orchestrate a bunch of specialists from different fields to collaborate , however it is not enough for individual contribution .i personally passed a phase where i was hungry for information and tried to learn everything but then i discovered that eveybody in the world knows at least one thing better than me .for example i was repairing my own automobile and makin my own surfboards when i discovered that someone else can do a better job than me and it will cost them less time .it will also cost me less money if i spend it working on what i know .the same applies for academcis .now i believe that you should do one thing that you know and do it it right .
