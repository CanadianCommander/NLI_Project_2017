i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .from the simple obversation , young people have more activites in their everyday life than the older people .they go out for travels , go sporting , or dancing , and so on .they seem enjoy life more than the older people .but it is superficial .we ca nt get the conclustion just from the more activites they take .whether it is enjoying life or not depends on the quality , motivation , emotion of entertaiments and other deep factors .the motivations and quality of activities differ between the young people and the older people .this leads to the fact that the older people more enjoy life than the young people when doing entertainments .the older people usually have more spare time than young people .therefore , when they do their actitives , they really enjoy their times .but for young people , a lot of pressures always make their activites rush or pushy .most of time , the activities of young people just help them release and relax a little bit , because they will put themselves into tougher situations later or they just are exausted from a very tough time .the deeper factors affecting the conclusion come from social and psycholigical side .the society usually gives more expectations to young people .on the other hand , the young people are still in the developing period .thus , there are many uncertainties enfronted by the young people .they need to develop themselves , recognize the society , and adjust themselves into the world .therefore , for the young people , chanllenges and unstability are good for them but they really bring many difficulities or obstacles for them , including physically and mentally .it is really hard to say thta they enjoy their lifes while facing so many problems .but for the older people , they have already experience most of their lifes .they are more calm , and stable .so , they are more enjoying their current time .in sum , young people do nt enjoy life more than older people do .
