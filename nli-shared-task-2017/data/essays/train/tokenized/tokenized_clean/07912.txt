i concur what the statement says .since i went to a lots of countries in many different kinds of ways , the best experienced i had was to travel as in a group led by a tour guide .when i was eleven years old , i went to phillippines with my family and we thought we would have fun not chasing by time becuase usually with groups we are chased by time .but throughout the trip , since it was our first time visiting phillippines , we did nt know any places so just looking for the good places , we spent one day just researching for places .the following day , my parents borrowed a car and we bought a map but then it was hard to get to the place because all the poplular places were far away .there were always full of people and there was traffic jams , when we got to the place , my dad was all ready tired .but if have gone with a tour guide , since guide knows where to go and about the places , he will explaing to us about that places and give us great information .those are the reasons why i like to go trip as in a group led by a tour guide .travelers do nt have to drive and we can look at the views in relaxed mood .we go to trip to have comfortable and have exciting time and we go to travel to get away from our normal same day lives .what is the point of going to travel , if we are having tired days like as normal days ?also , if we go as a group , we get to meet a lots of new people with diffrent chracteristics .i am outgoing and social so it was always fun to meet new people .in conclusion , i again agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .traveling in as a group is a best thing to do !
