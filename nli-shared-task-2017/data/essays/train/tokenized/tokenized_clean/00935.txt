i do not agree with the statement .this can not be said .because i think that every age has its own taste .so everyone at every age can enjoy life .but this is related about being pessimistic or obtimistic .what is enjoying life .what is the meanning of this .this chances people to people .for me enjoying life means being happy .and to fell happy there are a lot of reasson .but if u try to be unhappy u can do this it is very easy .if u are young that means your body let s u do a lot of thing that u want to .because u have more energy .u can make sports , go out with your girlfriend , go a lot of entartainments etc . ..u can do whatever u want illegally .and all of these makes u happy .also young people have not much responsibility .and they feel the life endless .when u get older the taste that u get from life chances .if u have a wife that u love , if u have good sons and dougters u are the most happy person in the world .u get happy with the good things that happen to your sons or dougters .your vife s worm hand makes u happy .beside all of these if u have grandchildren and if they likes u that makes u happier .maybe u have not the same energy as u were young but now u have more reasson to fell happy .so we can not say youn people enjoy life more than older people and we can not say older people enjoy life more than young people .every age has it s own beauty .everything is in your brain , if u teach it to enjoy life it always enjoys life in every age .so be honest to yourshelf whatever your age is raise your head u can see a lot of thing will make u happy ,
