people is talking about controversials things or topics .one of these topics is if the next twenty years will be fewer cars or not .some people support the idea that there are going to be less cars and othres have reasons to think that the number of cars will go down .on one hand those who support the idea that it will be fewer cars in the future , they think that oil is not going to be as cheap as today .so if people have to pay more it will be not so used .they also think that oil is not going to be there for ever .lastly the public transport is getting more popular than the car , that in big cities is sloweron the other hand , the people that support that the number of cars is going to increase or at least by the same .firstly because is the main way to move and people is used to it , and changing that is dificult .they also think that cars companys will change oil for other energy , that it will be cheaper an cleaner .lastly they think that car industry is too strong to stop it .i support the idea that it will be fewer cars in the future .firstly because of the oil the cars need .not only because of the price also i think that people is reallising that cars consume too much oil , what is bad for the air that we breath .secondly i think that publis transportatio is getting better ( at least in madrid , spain ) , so some times is faster than the car , and sure that is cheaper than driving .
