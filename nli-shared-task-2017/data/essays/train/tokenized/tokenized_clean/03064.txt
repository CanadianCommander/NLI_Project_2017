i agree with the statement because i think that if you only do what you know and even if you are very good at it you will not learn anything new from it .and i think that to take risks it might not be successful everytime but its a new way to learn .if you risk and is not successful you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistakes and how to not ever make them again .so i look at taking risks as a way of learning somthing new .if you do nt risk your live will never change and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situation of taking risks you probably would do nt know what to do , or what to say , or how to react .taking a chance to do somthing with your live like liveing in a different country , with a different language , different culture , and a lot of different situations , its to take risk because you dont know how people will act , or you do nt know peoples costumes , or even if you do nt know the language .but with time and a possitive actitude you will eventually learn about it .i belive that opportunity is taking risks and opportunity does nt come very often so i think even if you do nt end up been successful after it , i m sure you would learn something from it .i took the opportunity of liveing in another country than were i was born .and i did nt really know where i was going and how was it going to be .but with the time i have learned a new language and new culture , a different way to look at the world preaty much .so i think that i m preaty lucky because not a lot of people has done what i have , but i the same time i took a risk and i did nt know if it was going to be succesfull for me .that risk i took it s made me enrich my person .
