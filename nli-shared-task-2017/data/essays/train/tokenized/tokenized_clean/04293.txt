i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , as in the future carreere working on concepts is needed .only knowing some facts of a special theorie does not help to resolve a probleme , for example !example : in my interneship at the company lavazza i receveid a task , namely to resolve a problem in the marketing departure .therefore i did need special facts about the problems topic , but the facts were not required from the company .i had the possibility to look the facts up in the internet if i needed them .but the important point was to know how it is the best way to form the concept and how to develope the suitable ideas of this problem .the companz required these factors :1. understanding the problem task2. working on the problem task3. finding solutions for the problem taskmoreover i think that facts are the base for working on special topics or better an advantage for working on a topic .one should learn facts , but the most important point for students is to learn to understand special ideas and concepts in order to use them in the future .otherwise , only knowing the facts , without knowing how to work with them , is not helpful for future tasks .sure , there will be people who would be impressed , when they hear that you know various facts about o topic by heart , but only facts will not fulfill the requirements of a company one works in .as a resume it can be said , that facts are basically important to learn , but not as much important as understanding ideas and concepts , as it is not enough only knowning facts without having the capabality to work with them , for example to make a concept .the combination of learning facts and on the same time understanding the idea or the concept would be perfect !
