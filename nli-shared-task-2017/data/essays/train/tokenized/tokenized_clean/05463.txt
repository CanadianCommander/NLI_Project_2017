i firmly agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to learn how to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts and data .it may be true that facts are basic for a successful academic career , however for all the rest of the human beings it is just personal enrichment .it may also be true that learning raw data is a very rewarding experience , but again i would suggest to focus this desire on more stimulating and challenging activities .first , facts are much easier to forget than ideas .i am sure that no friend of mine from school will remember all the names of the rivers in our country , but they maybe can remember why the pc has been so important in the development of our culture .therefore , it is much more useful to learn something that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsense tough data , which you have to read over and over because it does nt have any logic behind !second , in our work we hardly use specific facts .but we certainly use ideas , concepts , arguments and logical discussions .at least i do in my consulting job .i have learned to structure my thoughts and put into practice improvement levers simply by understanding and applying ideas , not by remembering facts .third , facts can be looked again and again in books whenever we want .nowadays , there is no problem in finding information .we can just connect to the internet , make a search and find it right there .when i do nt remember a formula , i just do that .google is my good friend when i have memory loss .maybe other people just have a neighbour that knows it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field .i could go on saying that what the world lacks are good ideas , revolutionary thoughts that can improve the society we live in .this last idea leads me to my final argument : facts are part of the past while ideas are the raw material of the future .the formula of a circle has been invented many years ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pending subject and only with good ideas we will suceed in this matter .we should be engaged in providing an outstanding ideas-focused education to the future einsteins .for instance , during my education in high school in the usa i experienced a quite different approach compared to the european one .we should foster this type of education .summing up , my opinion is that students should learn what will be useful for them and for the society as a whole .consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .
