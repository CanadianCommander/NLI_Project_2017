i am 24 years old and a student , so i have not so much money and i am unsure about what the future will bring .therefore i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .one reason for my disagreement is the perspective for the future , which differs between younger and older people .younger people usually do not have concrete plans for their future .therefore it is difficult to really enjoy life , because one always thinks about what the future will bring .i know these problem when i have to decide wether to spend a lot of money for a new computer , an enjoyment for me , or better save the money .due to the reason that i do not know wether i will get a job , it may be better not spending so much money .older people mostly have a job and spending the money will not have such a big importance .another reason why older people enjoy life more than younger people do , is their opportunity to spend more money for certain activities they enjoy .for example i would enjoy learning how to fly a plane , but i do not have enough money to take courses .older people may have enough money to learn how to fly a plane and therefore can enjoy in doing so .beside these examples , enjoyment may also mean to have a wife and children .this is something generally older people have .so from my situation today , i look forward to have my own family and i think i will enjoy it .the reasons and examples above show , that older people may have less problems concerning money .they also may have a familiy and may be able to perform cost intensive activities they like .in contrast to that , younger people do not have these possibilities and often have to think about their future .therefore i think that older people can enjoy and do enjoy their life more than younger people do .so i am looking to the future and think that i will enjoy my life when i am older .
