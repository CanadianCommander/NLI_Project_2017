students often have to learn a lot of things in their studies .the basis for them is to learn the facts and then to understand ideas and concepts behind these ideas .so it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because it is impossible for students to keep all facts in mind , because they would not be able to connect the facts they have learned in one subject with the facts of another subject and because they would not be able to interpret all the facts  consequences .of course it depends on a student s course how many facts he or she has to learn but in 4 years of study , there are a lot of facts which are impossible to keep them all in mind .i study history and i am now in the 6th semester .each day we learn a lot of facts and dates .i , personally , know only about a 10th of all facts and dates i have heard during my studies .and these 10 % are already a lot .moreover a student would not be able to connect the facts he or she has learned in one subject with the facts he or she has learned in another subject .the student would not see a dependency or other relations between two facts .a friend of mine e.g. studies economy .there he has to learn facts in finance and facts in marketing .one might think that these two subjects have nothing in common but it might happen that something has to be calculated in marketing in the same way it has to be done in finance .here would be a relation which a student who only learns facts , would not see .then the interpretation of the facts  consequences is important .the students have to know how some e.g. key numbers are created .it might happen that they are not true .all in all it is to say that the basis of studying are the facts .without these facts it would be impossible to come to new ideas and concepts .but more important are ideas and concepts to see behind the facts and to discuss them .only by learning facts this would be impossible .the student would not be able to connect facts of several subjects and he would not be able to see the facts  consequences .
