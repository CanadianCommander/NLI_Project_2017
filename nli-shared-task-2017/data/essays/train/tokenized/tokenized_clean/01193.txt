people are thinking about their future or what they are going to do when they are still young or old .some people think that older people can enjoy life more than young people .because they have lots of time for lesures .but i do nt thinks so .i agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do ..there are some reasons i agree with this statement .first , literally young people are young .that means they have times to do their work , have fun within the life they got .actually they have to earn the money for the future , study for their college and so on .in the united states , people work since they are 16 years old typically and they earn their own poketmoney .young people can do whatever they want .but the older people ca nt .because they are too old to do fun thing in the world .the body gets really slow , sick and lazy .they might have just little energy to do it even if they have lots of free time or money .secondly , most of young people are open-minded .that does nt mean older people are close-minded .in my case , if i want to do something , i would do whatever i want .i do nt think about advantages of that or disadvantages .i just enjoy what i get to do .people like to do stuff what they like .and young people can try anything .but for older people they have lots of limits for that .for examples , they are not able to climb up to the mountains a lot or go swimming , get drunk , ride fun ride at the fair and so on .third reason is that they know a lot of things than older people .the world is changing constantly .sometimes new things are coming up and sometimes old things are being thrown away from our society .so i am saying that young people can get a lot of information about that and get to know and have fun with it .actually i like to do something new with my friends .that makes me challenge for that and eventually have fun .young people do nt fear about the new things .and they can accept well than older people .since i am young , i understand i can do anything whatever i want .young people have dream , thought , goals .but i think the most thing we have to do is to have fun in our life because we are still young and have lots of time to do other stuff , open-minded and we know lots of things coming up recently and enjoy it .so i agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do ..there are a lot of things to have fun in our life .i do nt want to miss it and we can have fun than older people do .
