as we all know , life is changing very fast and new inventions are rising now and then .some may say that some of the older inventions will come to an end and some would say these inventions will still remain .one of these inventions are automobiles .in my opinion i dont think that cars will fewr after twenty years from now for several reasons :first , a car is an essential thing to have nowadays simply because one could not do anything with this precious gift from science .the main reason that gave the first idea of inventing the car was the difficulties man had faced during his daily life either because of the distence or because of illness .some may argue that there were animals which can support people , i think that dealing with a thing that has senses is really hard specially when it comes to meuls or horses .another reason is that people cant stand - and i m one of them - living without having an automobiles .in these days and in the comming years , an automobile will be a sign of leasure and wealthiness ; some may prefer to say , but generally speaking it is an important invention that scientests have done .i think , like other people do - that technology is very costy .if we assume that cars will decrease because of a new thing that scientests have invented and this invetion will decrease the ammount of cars to the half , a simple reason will be that this kind of invention will be very expensive and not all people can manage to have it .from what i stated above it clearly shows that i have a pissamistic point of view , maybe because i dont belive in science , or simply because the increasing numbers of needy people who are the source of new automobiles .
