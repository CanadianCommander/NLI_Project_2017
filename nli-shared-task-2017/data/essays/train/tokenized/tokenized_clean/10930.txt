in my opinion , most advertiments make products seem much better than they really are .most advertiments establish for endustrial competion between thousands different companies .their competions are fair for their realm but they dont have to be honest for their work .on the one hand , today we are living in techonological world , using satallate and web , watching tv , movies and reading news .always we see advertisements every where for instance , on bus , on wall , on building .i belive they dont tell truth every time because they dont need it .most advertiments company just consider an amount of their sales .they dont care people who buy their products .on the other hand , when i watch tv and see some products which i know so well because i am used to it before .i am just annoying these companies .indeed , they are liar therefore i cant trust on them .my point of view is the most important thing related to especially food advertisements .let me give you a picture about fast food companies in united states .for example , mc donalds is one of them , this company is common fast food place worldwide .today , we have to endovour and to reveal the most significant problem about obesite in this country and developement countries .every day and every where we are facing and watching all this fast food advertiments and feeding ourself and our children in this place .we dont know really what we are eating as well .besides , they could be dangerous for our health , they could be deadly for us .i watched a video about mc .donalds and i saw that they are killing us .in this video ther is a man who ate hamburger and fried potatose every day and he got very serious health conditions after thirty days .he had to give up eating mc donalds foods .there is no doubth about most advertisements dont give reality for their produc
