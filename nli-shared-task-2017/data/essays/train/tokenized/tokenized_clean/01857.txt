if it is about students , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .there is pro and con for this issue .however , i think it is much more important to learn about ideas and facts .first of , we all sure that education is the most crucial subject that influence a societys development .today the competion between countries and companies is global .so how can you differ your product or company from the others ?the answer is creativinity .if you can think different , you will eventually produce different and live different than others .to improve creativinity we should urge the students to think different .nonetheless , it is impossible if you just make them learn the information .secondly , we have to consider the aspect of learning .the natural way of it is experience .that is why the best schools around world have also the best labs .you should let them experience by themselves .since the experince is the most valuable and the expensive knowlege .just consider how the civilizations rise .it is more permenant to help someone to comprehend someting than to force them to learn .i think , this is the problem , which we have in my country , turkey .for instance , i study engineering .the more i make experiments , more i feel confident about my knowlege .therefore , it is more essential to learn the ideas and the concepts .if you just memorize somethink , believe me you wo nt keep it for a long time .third of , we also should consider the joy of learning .would it be enjoyable just by learning the facts .for example , lets think about the magnetism .i can assure is is quite boring if you just give the facts to the students .on the other hand is really interesting when you see it yourself in a lab .in conclusion there are many ways of learning .learning by understanding ideas , concepts and principles could have some drawbacks .however this wont change the fact that it is the best way .
