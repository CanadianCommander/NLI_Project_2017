a graet man said before in a long time ago `` the small ones are the once who rise the city up or take it down  .his words were right because that was the truth .nowadays kids refuse to help others and they wo nt give enough time and effort to help thier community .i think that this is a great big fact .so , i agree with the statment for two resones .first , nowaday teenagers do nt do what they are supposed to do and they do nt carry the responsibility of thier behaviors .they always act sush as babies and never care about any thing exept if they will have something as an effort if they took care about that thing .that s a bad acting and wo nt help them even when they grow up because that effects thier community .in this way , thier children will act the same way and there wo nt be any exampels of cooporation .another thing is that the young people are more active and have more potinsules , so they can effored more than the older ones and they truly can rise their community by helping it and taking with it hand .and so , every one can live in a nice , loving and cooporatoinal sosiaty .in the end , i would refear that young poeple should do thier jobs and help their community to rise and be better .
