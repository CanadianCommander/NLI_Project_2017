i most certainly agree with this statement .as a music teacher myself , of course i want my students to learn their facts , but it is more important for them to understand it .i believe that a student should be able to understand what they just learned because that is why we learn in school .we go to school to learn and understand the materials to apply it to our lives .if a student did not understand something , then they are not going to be able to use it in life .the best way of knowing what they have been taught is asking them to use it .if they can not use what they had learned , then that means they do not understand that certain topic .it is absolutely pointless for a student to go to class and just memorize facts .to understand something means you can use it , teach it to someone , and be able to go further than just  memorizing  the facts .to me , in order for any student to excell is for them to be able to use what they know .i am not saying that learning facts are not important for a student , but sometimes there is no point in teaching that topic to the student if it means they do nt know what just happened .a student can walk in a class and ` learn the facts  , but that student will come back out with only facts .for example , there is a math student who just learned all the numbers of a problem .sure , he knows all the numbers , but how in the world the numbers got to where they are is a completely different matter for the student .that is why teachers today take time to pull things apart and explain them in details .this situation can happen in any class .poetry can be read and the students can read it and learn the vocabulary to only read a poem .although to go through the details of the poem would be much more effective in a student s literature skills .i do not agree that facts is all we should learn about in life .there is much more to learning than just facts and statistics .being able to truly understand what was taught is the same as saying , `` okay , i know how to use it now and it definitely makes more sense than just memorizing notes .
