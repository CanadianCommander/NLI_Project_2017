knowledge in any form is welcome be it in depth or breadth .for the development of a society both types of people are required , those who have in-depth understanding of a particular subject and those who have a generic understanding of many subjects .in my field of consulting it is important for me to have a broader understanding of businesses rather than focus on any one .therefore the pattern of knowledge would primarily depend on a person profession and futrure aspirations .i support the statement that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects are required , but even specialists are necessary .there is no-doubt that specialization in subjects leads to further development of technologies and theories which help the society at large .for example the invention of various kinds of vaccines were done by eminent researchers and scientists .however , research alone does nt guarantee the success of an invention , it was a collaborative effort of businessmen who funded this research and made sure common man has access to it .so it is not only specialists but also generalists that we require , who have a bigger outlook and can co-relate things .but again it is the job of a person that should decide the apttern of his knowlege .for example if the aspiration of the individual is to become a professor or researcher , then surely an in-depth understanding of the subject is indespensable .which would require him to focus on a particular subject .on the other hand , if the person is a journalist or a politician , a broader perspective of society is requred , to perform well in their jobs .on conclusion , i would like to add that both forms of studies are important .generalists and specialists both are required for the development of the society .
