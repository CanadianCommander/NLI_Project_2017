people always have liked to travel , but there are two principal ways to do that , travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel alone .both ways have advantages and disadvantages .when people travel in a group , they have to follow all the instructions of the tour guide .they have to start and finish the experience at the same hour , and if somebody does not like the rule , he can not do anything for achieve his wish .there is no freedom .for example , in the rome s tour , there is not time to visit all the places in the city , the tour only visits the coliseum and the vatican .however , if you like the speech from the tour guide , you can enjoy the experience a lot , because you do not have to look for the interesting sites and its history or its data , the tour guide provides it them to you .this way to travel is so easy and comfortable .altough many people prefer the way to travel alone , because they do not have to follow another group .they decide all that they will do by themselves .they use a map , a tourists book or the advices of some friends .they visit all the places that they want and stay there one day or one year .in this way to travel you can spent your time or your money in your deepest wishes , your doubts about some places and cultures or attending your necessities .in my opinion , i think that it is the best way to travel , because i have the freedom to chose what site i will visit , what food i will eat , what time i will spent and at what hour i will wake up and i will start my experience .for example , i want to visit quintana roo but the group led by a tour guide probably visit cancun in the morning not either tulum in the midnight .
