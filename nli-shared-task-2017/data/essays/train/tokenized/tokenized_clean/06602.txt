conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they did nt have to many sad experiences yet .i think that it is ironic since most of people want to live longer .but it is also true that everybody wants to look younger .first of all i think that old disabled persons who live with an amount of pills can not really enjoy their life .but older persons like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people .it can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously .teenagers often consider high school period as the worst period of their entire life .in fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes .they often contest the authority of their parents or their professors .this is the expression of an unease .on the contrary to teenagers , adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoy life .children do nt want to become adult because they are reluctant to have too many responsabilities .they are not aware of the violence and of the other problems that one could encounter , if they are to protected by their parents .parents think that their children are happier thanks their protection but on the contrary , children will be more disappointed when they will discover how harsh the life can be .when one looks in the past , one often thinks  i was so dumb  .i do nt regret this period of my life because i was ignorant and i do nt want to balk now .i want to go on and make new experiences .life is a surprise at almost any age and this is why one can always enjoy life .
