i do agree to the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  in many ways here are the someyoung people can enjoy their school and campus life more than anything else , since they dont have any responsibilities like leading a family , taking care of the office work , managing finacial status an so on as the older people have .more over older people have to struggle all the day and then they dont have any time to spend with their families .but the young people can enjoy thier campus life all the day and then they have time to spend with their family .for example : i have seen my servent working all the day at different houses to earn some money for her children .she helps her children in buying any items which they ask her .in this example you have seen that younger people are enjoying and getiing what they need in life but the older people are working all the day .of course my servent feels happy in buying a gift or any thing their children want .once if any one gets married in his/her life that might be the end to enjoying because i have seen many people changing their attitude or working even more harder than used to before , more responsibilities come into place and they dont have time to enjoy .most the young people can enjoy their life because they dont have any worries or tensions in their .young people can do what ever they like to do but the older people cant do because they have to think a lot before taking any decision .i conclude that `` young people enjoy a lot more than the older people  as i explained above with examples aand reasons .
