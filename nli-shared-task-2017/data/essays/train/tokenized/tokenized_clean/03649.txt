i agree broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .when i was a child , my parents want me to study a lot of things .for example , except that i study my lesson , and must play the piano , learn dancing and ride a horse .they want me to become a broad knowledge people .they think there are three reasons .the first .when you grown up , you may make some people or recognize a little person .different people you should speak different words .so you should ues different knowledge .if you just know a specific subject .you can not play with some different kinds of people .you do not know what you should said and what your some different friends want to hear .for example , my friend want to make a friend that is a america girl , .but my friend does not understand english , so at last my friend does not make a friend with a america girl .the second and the important .if you know broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you can have more chance of job than specialize in one speciflc subject .because you know different knowledge you can work in different envieroment and recognize different people even increasing your another knowledge .for example , if you know english , you can work in u.s.a or england and a lot of countries .if you just know chinese you may work just in china .so you lose a lot of chance .so i think better to have broad knowledge of many academic subje
