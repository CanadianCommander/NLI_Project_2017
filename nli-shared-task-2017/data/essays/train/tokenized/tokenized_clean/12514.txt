the quality of successful people is usually discussed .some say that they are more prone to be adventurers , trying new things and taking risks , rather than doing what they already know how to do well .from my view , i totally agree with this for the following reasons .without trying new things , nothing can be created .when we look back what the great people in the past like albert einstein does , they made a lot of imaginative assumptions , and finally he revealed the famous physics equation and the great theory of relativity .all these discoveries have brought about many benefits to us since their establishments .beside theories and discoveries , all inventions we usually every day would not exist should the great scientists did not try new things and take risks .think about the richest person in the world , bill gate .he designed a software that our lives greatly rely upon it - windows .without the ventures and new ideas , our world is just the same compared to our ancestors  .not only scientists but many successful political leaders have this quality .for instance , the first american president , george washington , taking the risk to be arrested or even killed , led people to overthrow the colonial rule .others include the drafters of new ideologies like democracy and fair world trade .they dared to introduce and more importantly , to implement them .all these bring about significant impacts today , even they might live thousand years ago .another reason supporting the statement is their faith to success .their desire to find new things is a strong motivation for their work .if people do not try new things , they recognize all what he can do .there will not be new impacts on their lives .consequently , they have less motivation to strive for success and are easily conceited with their past achievements .on the other hand , imagine a very diligent but conservative person who does merely whatever he knows .eventually , he is just a master of the present knowledge .he can not move further and stays at whatever he is .without new things and ideas , it would turn out to a very boring world .every thing repeats as it used to be and there is no surprise at all .considering the above , we see that trying new things and taking risks are important attributes to successful people .
