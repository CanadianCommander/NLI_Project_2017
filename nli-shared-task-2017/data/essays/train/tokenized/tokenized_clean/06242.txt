in general speaking , a lot of people love new things , especially young peole .i suppose that everyone need ambisious feeling for many thing , therefore i agree with that successful people should try new things even there are some risks .for example , there is one successful person with art , and he already has a lot of jobs belonging art .but one day , he really interested in to be auther .however , if he quit his job now , he can not avoid from the position of the person who has no job .in this case , he has to think carefully about his future first , and then , if he really want to be auther even there are some risks , he should be the auther .however , he has to efforrt to be the auther very much .if he notice that he shoul not to be the auther later , and there are no jobs , it is his responsibility .it was good for him to notice that he should continue his jobs same as before .if someone who want to try new things even there are some risks , they should try .there are no experoles of own lives only doing what they already know how to do well .even the people who love to dong only one thing , they might had a time to think
