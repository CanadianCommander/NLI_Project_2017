for decades researchers are to find an answer for this argument .who enjoys the life more young people or old .enjoying life does not really depend on age it mostly depends on how much somebody likes to live , wealth , and life conditions .the first step of enjoying the life is loving it .at the age of twelve or fourty it does not matter if somebody loves to live he can enjoy his life more than anybody in this universe .also the way of enjoying life depends on what you like to do .because of the age advantage people think that young people enjoy the life more than the elders .the main reason for that is appropriate and inappropriate behaviors .of course there are certaing things that differs the young from the old but still this does not mean young people enjoy life more than old people do .a wealthy person can do what ever he wants .he can travel all around the world , eat all kinds of food , and experience many different cultures .this is what majortiy of the people think about enjoying life .if this is the only way to enjoy the life how should a person who lives in an economy budget , can only afford living expenses , and barely shops for himself feel .again this is just a fact to enjoy life is not the only way to enjoy it .enjoying life does not depend on certain things , especially age , wealth , or life conditions .to be able to enjoy the circumstances and the conditions for everybody might not be easy but otherwise all of us would be unhappy and the life would be miserable .
