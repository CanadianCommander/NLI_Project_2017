i think that a successful person is more focused on trying new things rather than doing what he or she already knows well .infact a successful person is a person who wants to make the difference .let me explain .a successful person is a person who wants to be different from other people ; he / she wants to have some characteristics that can make him/her special in front of all other normal people .to do that , a succesful person has to try new things and not only to do what other people do every day .the history shows us many examples of men a women that have changed the world by trying new things .i m talking about inventors that , by doing new things , has introduced some important innovations .these men and women had taken a lot of risks by doing that .the inventor that i admire most is marie curie , who developed the x rays technology .x rays technology is very important today .however , marie curie died because of intoxication caused by the big amount of x rays that she absorbed .without her sacriface , today we wouldt have one of the most important instruments to diagnose deseases and illness .however , i have to say that a successful person is a person that is able to take some risks only when risks are proportionated to the benefits carried by doing new things .only a stupid person can take some big risks without the possibility to get some bigs benefits .for example , managers and brockers , who are the main actors of the financial world , try new things ; for example they try to invest money and time in new areas of the world or in new technologies .they do thatt only when the risk connecetd to the financial operation is as big as the return of money waited .
