in my opinion , i would rather like students to learn facts more than understand ideas and concepts .i will describe why do i think so , and give an brief example in the following paragraph .let me say we have some issue , for this essay .first of all , ideas and concepts are just surface of an issue , while facts are clarified matter .also , ideas and concepts are sometimes people s opinion or imagination which often unreliable , while facts are reality and truth .those factors let me think ideas and concepts are less important than facts ; wchich ever contains details and truth are more valuable .to give an example , several years ago at kyoto , japan , there was a political meeting where president bush refused to sign the issue of co2 .many countries were upset about it .in the argument , there were lots of defferent opinions and ideas which were criticizing or supporting president bush .for some countries , they even changed their mind because of the president reaction .the fact in the was that the president did not sign the issue period .fact never changes , but people s ideas and concepts do .i do not say having one s own concepts and ideas are not good .but when in the learning process , students need to know truths first before having their own opinion .i think it would be wonderful when a student has his own opinion based on the truth .
