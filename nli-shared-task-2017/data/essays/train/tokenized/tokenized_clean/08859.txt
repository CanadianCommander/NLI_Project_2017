i disagree with this statement .i rather think that there is no difference in intensity of enjoying life but in the way of expression due to biological causes of aging .one might come to the conclusion that younger people enjoy life more because they are more socially visible at the beach , in dancing halls , outside doing sports , falling in love , engaging in modern trends and so on and so forth .one might think , the world is open for them and warmly welcomes them in contrast to older people who are just sitting at home thinking about the past and only waiting for their end while the world s door has been closed before them for ages already .in a certain way , the first part is true .older people , with exceptions , simply are physically unable to do all the things younger people do and more often stay at home .and , taking this fact into consideration , older people must care for their health more intensively to be able to take part in allday life which leads to the fact that they are recognised by society mostly in association with health care and nursing homes .but this is only a matter of perception , and it will probably change in the future .the given statement is not about the way of expressing the joy of life but rather about the individual experience of joy .older people simply do other things than younger ones to make their life enjoyable .even if their toughts might go back to the past most of the time it would be just normal since they have witnessed and experienced more things than younger people .and , of course , to examine and assess today s events one mostly compares them with things that one has witnessed in the past .but apart from that , older people , for instance my own grandmother who was a children doctor throughout her life , now travels around the world at the age of over 77 , goes to classic music concerts and meets her friends .and she is still very capable both mentally and intellectually .in conclusion , i think that it is merely a matter of perception .and since western industrialised societies are getting older and older in terms of their population this quite popular statement will be heard less and less , on the one side since there are simply more older people and , secondly , because health care develops further inventing more and better medicaments and therapies etc .hence more and more older people can still take part in the outside social life which nowadays may be seen as reserved exclusively for the younger ones .
