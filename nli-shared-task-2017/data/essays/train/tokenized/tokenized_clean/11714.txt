no matter where you go , what you do or what your educational background might be , you will be confronted with advertisements every single day .you see them in newspapers , magazines on television , even at bus stations .thats why it is no wonder that companies spend thousands of dollars for the marketing of their products .in my opinion it is true that that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because most companies spend a significant amount of money to advertise their products , they obviously want as many peolpe as possible to buy their product .in order to do that , they must make their product sound as good as possible , probably even better than the products of their competitors .to be able to do that companies need to make sure that all the emphasis is on the positive features their product obtains .and therefore also try to hide all the imperfections a product might have .if you take a look at just the advertisements in a magazine , you can already tell if it is a magazine that is suppose to be read by females or males .if you think about a very well known magazine for women like instyle , you find one ad for lipstick after the next .every single one of them tells you how uniqe the lipstick is and what great features it has , but none of them points out any negative things like if they are produced in a 3rd world country or if any animals were used for the testings of it .companies need to make sure that their product stands out and that people feel they desperately need it in order to get people to buy their product in particular and not a similar one of another brand .companies try to give the reader of a magazine the feeling that they are only young and hip and fit in with everyone else if they own their product .that is why in my opinion products often seem so much better when they are advertised than they really are .not only because companies put the emphasis on the positive things but because they try to hide the things that would make their product much more difficult to sell .
