some students think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .i belong to this category of student because ideas and concepts are more general and easier to understand .the first reason why i think it s more important to understand ideas and concepts is the variety of situation i can apply the same concepts .sometimes , during their studies , people learn of lot of different ideas from their many courses .at the begining , students might think that all the concepts they learn are only related to the classe they are taking .however , students may be surprised that a specific topic can also be apply to other disciplines .for instance , when i went to the university , i enrolled in a seminar of ethical issues regarding medical interventions .at first , i was nt very interested learning this subject just because my major was in business .however , the week after the seminar , a dramatic event happend .in fact , my father lost his job without logical reason and after 25 years in the same company .at this point , i changed my mind and i saw that ethic can also be apply in business management because obviously the company in which my father worked had no ethic .moreover , i think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts because it s easier .when people learn facts , it could be very hard to understand the main idea or the conclusion of an event .indeed , facts often involve different points of view and conclusion might differ from a person to another .unlike fact , ideas and concept are the most of the time very clear .for example , if a student in an economic class learn the concept of supply and demand , it must be very clear because everybody agree with this concept .however , the fact that the price of tomatoes has increased after a twister because all plantations were destoyed is not always obvious .in fact , many other factos might be involved in this phenomenon .in conclusion , i deem that it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts more than learning facts .nevertheless , after having understand concepts , students may have the opportunity to apply these ideas to some specifics facts .
