i really enjoy to plan my trips by myself or with my girlfriend , it s a sort of pleasure for me to make researches on the web about all the details such as traveling , housing and main destinations , so most likely i disagree with the given stimulus .when you experience a tour organized by somebodyelse there are many things which are not under your personal control .many important decision are often taken by the group and i do nt really like to vote on things when i travel , by contrary i like to spend time where it s more valuable accordingly to my taste and personal interest .in addition i think that a guided tour usually presents events which are designed for tourists .i still remember when i went to thailand with my family in 1991 and the tour guide basically was always showing us cultural events and shows which were very far to be authentic expressions of the local habits .i prefer to manage my own time during the trips and do nt be bothered by any time constraints or scheduled appointments as usually happens with guided tour .thus i really like the intimacy of a romantic trip with my girlfriend , so i will eventually consider other options when i ll be older .
