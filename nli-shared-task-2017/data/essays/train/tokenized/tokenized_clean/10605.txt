i do nt agree with the following statement : `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i believe that they are in fact investing more time into supporting their communities that their predecessors did .to raise a few specific reasons regarding this point , they are as follows :first , thanks to political maturity and stability in korea , most of the korean students are not involved in the wild student movements any more .they purely think about their academic affairs and building whole character through helping those who are in needs .for example , it is often noted that many young stuedents visit the homeless people in the vicinity of their schools and provide food and some medicines .second , the higher educational institutions like universities and colleges restarted the education of theory and the practice of ethical education .these school authorities specifically have developed and initiatied multiple ` community support programs  , and are encouraging their studednts to actively participate in them .third , the strength of the students  community support activities are in that the students can enjoy sufficient time to help the communities during their regualr vacations in summer and winter .moreover , many of thier parents and their school authorities are not sparig any financial assistance for the people .fourth , from a systematic approach , it is very clear that almost all lower and higher educational institutions throughout the country are focusing on graduating students of whole character .it is known that the students are , to some extend , required to plan and carry out their respective community support activities during the summer and winter vacations .also , as a matter of course , the school authorities give credits to them .in conclusion , young people s proactive participation into the community support activities is very much desirable societal phenomena .their spirit and enthusiasm have to be further nourished and encouraged by every segment of the society .
