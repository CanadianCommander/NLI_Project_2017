i agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts  for several reasons .the reasons include the skills to do it practically , innovative ideas they get , able to answer the twisted question properly on the tests , participate in group discussions and if possible clear the doubts of the peersstudying some thing and learning should not be just for the sake of taking tests and getting grades , it should be for knowing the essence of subjects .students should be able to practically implement what they read rather than just cramming and giving the exam .only understanding the ideas and concepts help student to do the practicals not just learning .if student does not know how to practically use a computer what is the use of studying computers ?by understanding the concepts clearly student can think some innovative ideas to do the project .if the entire essence is know he/she can get innovative ideas and implement them and student can find lots of carrer paths in the area .there is lot of difference between a student who writes just a program and who writes effective program taking in to consideration execution time , memory space etc . ,the student ca nt expect all the questions from the textbook for their examination .if a student just learns the facts he/she ca nt answer any question given .they can just answer questions from the textbook .but the student who understands the facts can answer any type of question .modern day education system gives lots of importance to class discussions and group studies .few of the schools even give some percentage of marks for them .for the effective participation in class discussions student not only needs good preparation but also good understanding of the things .then only he can play a better role in the discussion .it is better to study in groups rather than studying individually .in group studies students will have more scope to understand things and discuss with their peers .students will get the confidence on some subject when they can clear the doubts of their co-students which is possible only if they have better understanding and knowledge of the subject .so definetely the way student understand things has a great impact on student s knowledge , practical knowledge and there by carrer in their future .
