i agree with the statementa stratege of promoting productsa way of attracting customers from existing marketas we are in the twenty-first century , we are facing more challenge in promoting our products to occupy the market than before , more especially the new products .therefore , manufacturers as well as retailers must find an efficient way to sell the products .advertisement is the very important way to introduct the products to the market .there is a marketing department in every successful company to promote the products or services to existing customers as well as potential ones .take cell phone company as an example , in us , we have verizon , t-mobile , singular etc .thus , their advertisements are really play critical roles in attracting more customers .so there are famous sentences such as : `` raising the bar  , `` the best network follows you  or `` get more minutes  and so on .cellphones serve the function of our communication , so i think those advertisements do not describe the real functions of their products , in other words , it is a kind of exaggerating .we have more products to compare and to choose in the limited market .i still take cellphone as an example , we can not use more than one cellphone in our life .we make our choice according to the advertisements of those cellphone companies or the recommendation of our friends .i signed my contract with verizon simply because they advertised their family plan .as a matter of fact , the `` best network follows you  sometimes did not work out in my situation .in certain area or in the moving car , i experienced bad signal problem .to sum up , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to survive in the competitive society .as a consumer , we should protect ourselves by purchasing rationally .
