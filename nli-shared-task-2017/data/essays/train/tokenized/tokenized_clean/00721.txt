most advertisemetns make products for many reasons .they want to sell their products to earn their money and many people have the experience that when you bought something home and realized that are not useful just like what it appeared in a advertisement .in my opinion , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better thatn they really are .the purpose of dvertisements is to make their products to be bought .they want to sell their products .therefore , they need to urge customers to buy .they will use everything to urge you to buy their products .althought it looks not good to eat , advertisements will use the pictures or sounds to let it look like delicious .then , advertisements use people s desire to sell their product .for example , a advertisement which a hot model hold a diet drink will make many women to buy , because they want to be a hot model .but , in fact , you ca nt just drink the diet beverage and become the hot model .advertisements use that idea to sell their products althought the diet drink are not really working like that way .finally , advertisements only show the merit of products .advertisers want to sell their products , so they exploit the fallacy of a products .they only show the good site of their products .for example , we can see a lot of televsion food advertisements on the television .they only tell you how delicious they are , but they have never told you that how you really tasted .they make you see the good parts of products , and you go to buy it , then their goal is achieved .because many reasons which they sell their products make the real products are not as the same as they look like in dvertisements .they can be based on the purpose to sell , the use of your desire , and showing the good part to persuade you to buy their products .therefore , i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
