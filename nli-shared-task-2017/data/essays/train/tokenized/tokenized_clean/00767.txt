with the rapid growth of our civilization , more and more people start paying attentions to enjoy their lives .indeed , with the passing of time , the meaning of life starts to change .many people realize that health is not equal to wealth .moreover , we are standing on the crossroad .in this turning point , young people enjoy life more than old peolpe do because young people intend to do a varity of sports , experience less pressure from the society , and obtain the tendency to try something new .it is no doubt that many sports are for young people .with the upcoming of beijing olympic 2008 , many sports are introduced at the same time .my daily experence is a good example of this , i went to ski last month in vancouver .when i was standing on the top of the mountain , i rarely see any older people around .in fact , it is estimated that there are more than 500 unique sports in the world .therefore , there are so many sports for young people to attand today ; however , at the same time , there are so few sports for old people to attend .perhaps the only sport i can think of is yoga .to be brief , when doing a sport , young people have more choices than older people do .besides , young people have less pressure from the society .in this comptetive society , all the parents in the world intend to keep their children from danger .on the other hand , some of the parents are trying really hard making money so that they would have a better life after the retirement .conversely , many young people think they have grown up .moreover , they do not feel the pressure from the society .therefore , they intend to enjoy their life more than their parents do .moreover , young people have the tendency to try something new than old people .there is a sport called `` ultimate jumping  . young people need to jump from a mountain or someplace very high with a rop tied on their feet .i have a friend called jimmy .he is crazy about this kinds of sport , and he was extremely happy after he jumped because it gives him a chance to relax .therefore , young people intend to try something new to enjoy their life .with all the aspects considered above , young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my opinion , young people think better than older people do because they know that health is important than wealth .
