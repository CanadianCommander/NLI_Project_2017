i agree with the idea that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .there are two reasons for that .one reason is because i believe that broader knowledge makes me possible to interact with more diversified people and this will result in creating a new view or new perspective in my mind .if i were someone who knows only chemistry and has no intimate knowledge of other academic fields , people with whom i can make friends would be only someone like me who is a glutton of chemistry .i imagine this would not be salutary for myself , being aloof from the rest of the world .in the contraty , if i had interest and knowledge about , for example , german literature as well , aside from the major in chemistry , it would be possible for me to get acquainted with german people as well as to join a literature club .in this way , i can broaden my friends network which enables me broaden my views .this broad knowledge would also be favourable for childeren when we conduct education .the children tend to ask us so many questions , this or that .if we could not answer at all , it would be disastrous for their growth .the other reason is a little bit more practical than the first one .in my opinion , having wider knowledge makes us more advantageous during job-hunting activities .this idea may not be applied if somebody wants to become an university faculty or scholar .in this case , we are requred to have very specialized knowledge on one topic .however , if you want to work in an organization , the personnel department checks whether we have diversified knowledge , so that we are such people who accept any kind of directions , which shows our flexible attitude .from these two reasons , i think it is better to have a wide-ranged knowledge .
