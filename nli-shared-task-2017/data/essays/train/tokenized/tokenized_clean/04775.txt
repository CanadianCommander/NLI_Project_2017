to understand the ideas and concepts and be able to utilize them is more important for students .once the ideas and concepts are clear to the students , they can easily relate those ideas or concepts to their own life experiences .i agree with the statement because this is how i learn in the high school .a good example can be seemed while my physics teacher is teaching us the concepts of volecity and factors .in order to make us understand that volecity is composed of different factors in different directions , the teacher gives an example of swimming in a river .as most of the students has experienced or known that when there is a current in the river and the swimmer is swimming right across the river , he will not actually go straight across the river because the current is carrying him downstrean as he swims forward .this really makes a lot of sense to all of us before we start learning any formulas .however , if the teacher just want students to learn the fact that the swimmer will go across the river adjusent to where he sets off by illustrating with a right triangle , i will probably be the first one to be confused .with the same source in my math class , this idea comes to me when my teacher tells us a story of his own .my math teacher used to be a straight-a student in the high school , and he did not care much about understanding the concepts of the course materials .instead , he solved the problems with formulas like a machine that does not know what exactly
