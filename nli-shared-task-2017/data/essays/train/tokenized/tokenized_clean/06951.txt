if we had the possibility to go to live for a short period in the past , but not too far , maybe just sixty or seventy years ago , we would have been shocked to see how many things have changed .if we speak to an elderly person , about 80 years old , surely he/she will say that he/she does nt recognise this world anymore .the behaviour of the people has changed , the way they consider and judge things which surround their town , they community , or their city is completely and totally different .as far as i am concerned , i partially agree with this statement .it is certainly true that the young generation does not give the right importance to helping the community they live in .infortunately , nowadays they are just interested in building up their careers , in climbing the career ladder , in going to parties , in getting drunk , and other millions of similar thing .i my opinion , however , in not good blame just young people , and the reason i am saying this is that we must not forget that is the society or , better said , the entirely world which pushes in this way .everyone must be rich , must have a fats and expensive car , everyone must have a huge and impressive house , etc . ..i am not surprised that young people are becomig more and more selfish and money-oriented .in these day we do nt have any more the positive values and the moral and ethical rules that our grandfathers had in the past century !moreover , my personal opinion is that this change in the behaviour and in the concern in the community problems is not just related to the new or young generation .in fact , also adults or `` old and mature  people are affected by this new disease : we can call it `` money-desire  .more and more grandpas or grandmas are left alone and without a real love and care by their relatives , because their children or their grandchildren are too busy too think about their lives .in conclusion , personally , i think that we should change the mind of the people who live in the entire world to assure a little more help to our communities and to our beloved grandfathers .
