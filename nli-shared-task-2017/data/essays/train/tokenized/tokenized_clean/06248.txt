in my point of view i would agree that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than today .lack of non renewable fuel , stress on ecofriendly environments and new technology will perhaps reduce the usage of cars in the future .the fuel which most of the cars in todays world use is the derivates of crude oil like petrol , diesel , gas etc. these are considered as the non-renewable sources of energy that they can not be recycled .once consumed they are lost for ever .keeping in view the current demand of this fuel usage , and the shortage of resources of supply , the production of oil will reduce rapidly .the price will be increased abnormally which does not fit the budget of most car owners .hence they have to shift to other means of public transport such as railroads or buses .the present soceity around us is slowly gaining the `` eco  feel .issues like global warming and the greenhouse effect are increasing the public awareness and thereby less pollution free environment is in continous demand .hence people of the future will be forced to use eco friendly means of transport .technology development is an unending process .every decade witnesses newer technological developments that benefit the people and society .the usage of electricity and other eco friendly fuels in means of transport is slowly picking up .may be advanced versions of the present day cars will come into use .these new transporters may gain popularity as they comply with the above two reasons of non pollution and also oil and gas free .finally as the time advances many more changes can be witnessed which serves in reducing pollution as well as ensure better comfort and efficiency .who knows ?the traditional `` car  that has become a part and parcel of todays life may be owned by a few and may also decorate the platforms of a many museums !
