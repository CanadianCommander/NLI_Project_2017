i do not agree that life is more enjoyable according to young people than according to elder people .it not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do .up to me , when you get older you will learn what kind of facilities and activities make you happy or unhappy .because of experiencing more than youngers , being older has lots of advantages .fistly , young people are more interested in trying new things .but it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do .they will experience an action to learn something .sometimes this action can lead young people to be unhappier than before .on the other hand , when you become older , i am sure that you will be more clear about new things .moreover , when somebody gets older , he or she generally becomes what sort of actions change the mood pozitively .as a result of these experiences , old people gets better time though they had fewer times to live than youngers have .secondly , the ages lived teach people to be more patient .that is why older people are tend to insist on doing something even though they were very unsuccesful on it before .usually insisting on something causes to an amazing success .tell me , who finds a succesful life lack of enjoy !as it is expected , instead of insisting on , young people tend to give up doing something that they are not succesful .this giving up is going to be a reason of not being succesful and unhappiness .finally , by the help of the experiences and the patient catched as a results of the experiences , old people like and enjoy life more than young people do .but it is very clear that one day everybody become older : as a result he or she is going to learn what makes life funny .
