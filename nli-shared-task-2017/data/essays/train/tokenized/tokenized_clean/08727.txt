many people think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and many do nt .both types of travelling have their advantages and their disadvantages .when you are travelling in a group , you have the advantage , that you do nt need to plan your trip exactly .you can just follow the tour guide and let him think about which places you are going to visit .like this you can see many beautiful places , which you have nt known before .the only problem you can have is , if you like to visit an other place , which the tour guide did nt plan before , you can not always do it , because you have to follow the guide s instructions .also , when you travel with a guide , you can get information about places and buildings you are visiting very easily .you do nt have to read in a book and look for the intresting information .a tour guide can give you information very fast and knows the intresting details .travelling in a group , you can also meet new people , make friends and spend time together on your trip .so , you are never travelling alone .but when you travel without a guide , you can also have fun .first you should organize your trip .for some people this can already be very excited .they buy books about places where they like to go .they can choose by their own , which churches , which other buildings and tourist attractions they want to see .and when they arrive there , they already know something about the place they are visiting .when you are travelling by your own , you can also change your plans .if you like a place you are visiting and you want to stay there for a longer time that you have planned , you can do that and you do nt need to follow the group you are travelling with .i personally prefer to travel without a tour guide .i like to plan my trip by my own and i do nt like to follow the whole time the guide and a group i possibly do nt like .
