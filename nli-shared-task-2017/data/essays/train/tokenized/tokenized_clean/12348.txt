i partly agree with that statement , but there is no point in lowering the neccicity of learning facts .they built the basis for further understanding .for example in biology , first you have to learn the facts , the terms and their definition .it s like learning a language you ll need for comunication with others in your field .so you have to learn the basic facts and terms and know them by heart to actually express yourself , your thoughts and questions .well , the facts are the tools but understanding the meaning of ideas and models is the actual work .one can use the tools for understanding the facts .and understanding is sometimes even harder than learning facts , because you have come to this point , i would call it `` aha  moment , and this can take very long .you probably have to repeat things you did nt understand at home on your own , and read secondary literature for better understanding .i would say , that understanding can be much more time consuming than just memorizing the facts .but once you really understood a theory or a problem you probably wo nt forget it , and you can built up on this .real understanding of ideas and theories can built the foundation for further questions or even own thaughts and theories .for example a student wo nt be able to present own thaughts in a topic he does nt even understand .additionally , understanding concepts is a cruicial requirement for a carrer in sciences .in sciences you have to understand the work that was done on your fild to built up on it , to add new ideas and create own thaughts .to sum this up , learning facts and knowing them by heart is neccecary to comuicate in your field and understand it , but understanding is the part that is cruical for own creativity of thaughts .
