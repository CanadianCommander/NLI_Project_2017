i do not completely agree with the statement that in twenty years of time there will be fewer cars in use as compared to the present .the present time is marked with great developments in the technology of cars .there is huge compettition in the market where industries are striving to design and manufacture more and more sophisticated and advanced machines .highly innovative and modern features are consistently being added to the older models in order to attract customers .there is a plethora of cars that require only their brand name to sound `` big  and thus maintain their superior postion in the market like the `` mercedeez benz  or the `` limousine  which are owned by only the very affluent class .therefore , at the time when the market of a product is at such a high and when further advancements have been promised by numerous companies in this field , twenty years is too small a period of time to mark a decrease in the use of cars .though in wealthy countries , cars may not be a very expensive luxury to own , there are countries where people still save money with a dream to own a car one day which would make family trips and outings more convenient and enjoyable .children aspire to have a car of their own with numerous features .the younger generation still craves for fancy models , racing cars , and other expensive brands .so there is no reason which can accont for and explain a decrease in the use of a cars in the near future .this might be a posiibility for more distant future when fossil fuels start to show a marked decrease , but then the future might be embracing solar cars and cars driven by other non-conservative sources of energy .today , when cars have become a household item , and when it becomes difficult to imagine of a whole day without having a car .it becomes difficult to pass even a single day away from your car when it may be having its share of time with the mechanic , and you feel handicapped .it has become a necessity today because of the conveniances it adds to our life .more and more companies are intoducing attractive and alluring models into the market .a fall in such a prospective and lucrative market in recent future has not enough grounds .
