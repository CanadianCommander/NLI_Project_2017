as the development of transportation , people travel more .the most common way of travelling is like this : going to a travel agency , flying to a place with a group people , listening what the tour guide said and flying back .i do nt , however , admire this `` common way  and never consider it the best way of travelling .the biggest problem brought by having a tour guide is the absence of freedom .you have to go to one place after another exactly as the fixed plan .the schedule was full of different arrangements and you could rarely get the chance of walking around alone in such circumstances .for instance , i once went to hong kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of people and a tour guide .as soon as she met me in hong kong , she started to complain about her trip .she said that she could nt go to the place she really wanted , eat food she liked , and even the shops she loved .all she did was taking buses to different places and walking around as a walking machine .she was very upset about her trip and did nt find any pleasure in it .another nightmare brought by group touring is shopping -- a group of tourists are often brought into a shop by the tour guide and forced to buy products .this is quite true in some coutries according to my own experience .since guides could get money from the shops , you may be badly treated by the tour guide if you did nt buy anything .nobody could have a nice trip in such cases , is nt it ?for me , i prefer going to places myself , without a tour guide or other unknown people .when i travelled to hong kong , i only booked my plane tickets and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agency .my travel is like this : i walked in the streets of hong kong , went to those small local shops that a tour guide would never introduce to you , eat those really `` hong kong  food that you may never eaten in a big restaurant , and talked with local people about their daily life .these are things you could never have when attending a group and led by a guide .leading by a guide is an experience of `` viewing and listening  , but not travelling ; only when you walked in a city or a place of interest on your own , can you find its charm and fall in love with travelling .
