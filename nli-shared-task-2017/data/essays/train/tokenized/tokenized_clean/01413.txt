i believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing to do .because of two reasons .first of all , succssful people usually think about new things and keep trying to be successful .they may do not like to do same things to the other .i think that they have a parsonality .however , if they want to do new things , they have to spend a lot of time and money .in addition , they do not know that will be succeed or not .i think they may contribute a society or they want to get a good job .at second , they try new things for some porpsose .for example , if they want to be more rich , they try to find more better job .because if they have personarity , they may invent something instead of money .in my opinion , i usually try new things eventhough i had to take risks .for example , i came in u.s to study nursing in a university .when i came to u.s before , my parents did not permit me to go the university .in parents opinion that i do not need to go to and university and get a job in u.s , because i already have a nursing license injapan .finary .i pasuade to my parents , and came here .however , if i go to an university , i have to spend a lot of time and money .but i believe that it is the best choice for me to study inu.s .so , if i have many risk now , if ican contribute a society , i think that is valuable for me .in conclution , i think that people require knowledge and skill .they will not succeed without it and also they will have a risks .but if they satisfied about that , i think they should do that before think toomuch .because it will good opportunit .therefore , i think that people should try to new things .
