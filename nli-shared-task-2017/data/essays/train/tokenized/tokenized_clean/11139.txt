some people think that the successful people have to only doing well in what they already know .it is really important to do well in well-known part .however , in my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks .first , trying new things improve their abilities .as they try continuously , they faced various problem , it would raise their ability to overcome the hardship .for example , there are my friends who have really different characteristic .one of my friend always try to speak with foreigner in english whether it is correct or not .he did his effort to improve his english skills , he can speak english fluently .however , another my friend did not any effort to improve his english skills .he did nt study english except learned from school curriculum .so he hates english , and never attach to it anymore .second , experiencing risks is also helpful .it can make people more strong and development their ability when they face to difficulties .for example , in my case , i was poor at physical works .as i worked in military , i experienced various risks such as using guns .when i was soldier , i had to keep my country , so i always practiced the using guns .it required really high concentration on using .a simple mistake could be a big accident .so i always did my best when i controlled the guns , it raised me up to get more self-confidence .people have their own thoughts about the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .some people might say that successful poeple have to do well in own part indtead of trying new things and risks .however , for these reasons , i think the challenging attitude enables them to improve their abilities and get more self-confidence .
