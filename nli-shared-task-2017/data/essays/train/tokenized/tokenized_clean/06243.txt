i strongly agree this statement .generally today people are more and more interested buying cars as an important necessity , and this trend does not seem to stop for the time being .however in twenty years a lot of changes will happens , such as technology will be advanced better , cyberspace will be more wider , and the concept of space will diiffer .first , in twenty years , there will be considerable change and advance in technology .that means new vehicle will appear instead of big cars .just think of the past .when people used only carts or bicycles , they may think that kind of vehicles are essential to their life .who could imagine cars or airplains ?similarly , we may not need cars ant more in twenty years .totally different vehicle , more convenient , more safe , will surely appear .second , more and more people now can work and study at home without moving .that is because we can use cyberspace or network system freely and efficiently .people maybe do not want crowded street , wasting precious time and taking risk of car accident any more .we wiil not need the vehicle itself in twenty years .third , many scientists from many countries now are working on discover more space over the earth .if it comes true , the concept of space will be different at that time .we can use only cars on the streets on the earth , but we can not use cars in the air in other planet .in different environment , we will use different vehicles or extremely we may not need any vehicle .in short , i think the use of cars is just appropriate for now .a lot of changes will happen , though we can not imagine what will be like .cars are just the useful invention of now , but it will be useless after humans are sick of them .there is no limit of human s satisfaction .
