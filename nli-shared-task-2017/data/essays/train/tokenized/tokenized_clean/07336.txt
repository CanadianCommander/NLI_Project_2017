it is my belief that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars than there are today .i feel this way because cars are too useful for us , in fact they support a lot of exigencies , and i do not think that they will be easily sostituted .one reason i believe this is because , nowadays , public transport can not realize the needs of people .moreover the tickets for using public transports are still expensive , and this fact does not permit to use them all times .for example , last week-end i was in forli , a small town near bolonia .my train arrived at 8 p.m. but i had to wait an hour for the bus that could bring me in the town s centre .and the bus ticket i paid was 13 euro !that is a lot of money for a student like me .another reason i think that cars will not decrease in the next twenty years , is because cars are often considered a precious thing .in fact they not only give the possibility to move in short time but sometimes they are also precious goods .for example , i can not avoid to use my car to go to the train station , because i would not have the possibility to go there in time .in fact the train station is at 40 minutes on foot from my house , and i would never be in time for the train .in fact i can not get up at 6 oclock in the morning for catch the train !instead , one example about the fact that sometimes cars are considered precious things could be this one .two years ago my father bought a blue porsche carrera , and for him this was the fullfillment of a dream .he really loves it !every sunday he drives it , and shows it to the relatives that have not seen it yet .for all these reasons i don  think that people who own this kind of cars will replace them easily , because they are considered like jewels .finally , as this essay has demonstrated , cars are still too much important for us for being replaced , in fact even if oil s price is higher and higher today , we can not think to sobstitute them with other means , probably because other means are not able to realize our needs .
