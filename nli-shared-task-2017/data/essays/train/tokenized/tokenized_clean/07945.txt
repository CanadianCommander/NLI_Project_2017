studying is a quite difficult and time-consuming task .for this reason , it is very important for students to know where is more efficient to put all their energy .one option is spend most of the time trying to memorize facts , such as numbers , formulas or dates .another aproach is trying to understend the concepts which actually explain those facts .i agree with the idea that it is more relevant for studens to have a complete comprehention of the concepts than just memorazing facts .also , i think that an aproach of learning based on understanding concepts is more effective than an aprocah of learnig based on memorized fact .there are two main reason which support my point of view .first off all , learning concepts is more enjoylable than memorizing facts .i remember when i was studing at the university and i used to hate all kinds of lists .in that time , i had to take a lot of history courses and it was quite common for proffesors to give long lists of dates of different events .because of my studies , i have memorized a lot of lits and i can say that this is not fan at all .secondly , i think that when we understand concepts related with some field , we can also use this concepts to understand differents areas of knowlege .this is the reason whay i bealive that understanding concepts is more effective than memorized facts .for example , at the same time that we are understanding concepts related with the biology of the human body , we can also be understanding ideas that make us able to have a comprehention of the others mammal s biology .all in all , i can say that i am sure that conceps should be considered more relevant than facts by students .basically because there are more enjoylable to learn and represent a more effective way to get knowlege .
