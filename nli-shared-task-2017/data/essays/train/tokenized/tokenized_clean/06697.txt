i agree with partly , in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use .using cars past twenty years increase rapidly .now these twenty years cars are not in use because of obsolence and out of fassion .it could be true in developed country because of their living standards are high as compare to the developing countries .they are prefer to by new one with more up graded technology and new fassions .in developing country like india cars use after their life was expried .these could happen only the economical conditions .in developed countries like usa their car do not meet their requirement they simply go for another one , which they have provided .india like countries most of the cars are in use after the twenty years .here the people living condition are low as compare to the developed countries .because of the economical condition not allow to change their vehicles .now the it boom has to give a scope to change their attitude towards their purchasing .in india after it revloution and mnc s people earning power has increased .computer professional are looking only to purchage new technology cars .it s leads use of car is increase .in developed country like usa is not big problem to maintain a car , even student are using car .their get cars cheaply as compare to in india .fuel avialablity are is there .there is few disadvantages as well as advantages to use cars .today every one use car and making fuel consumtion .after some year there will a problem to face to lack of fuel .we can not give better world to our future generation .now already exit the lacking in oil resources .my suggestion to my view point is to make better life with effect environment .using more cars will produce more pollution , please avoid the over pollution as possible as .
