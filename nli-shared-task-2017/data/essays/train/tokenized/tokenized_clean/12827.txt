nowadays peolpe are using advertisments in many and different ways .the huge companies main intresrt is to make an advertise for a certan product ; also the will hier experts in markiting just to give a good looking for the product .however , these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different .i strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the reason why i agree with this statement is because i dealed with many situations like that before .first , i worked for two years in an advertisement company bake home .it war really famous company and had a world wide name .one day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company , and theay had a meeting later on .in the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him , he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased .the man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him  do nt be worry , this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality .after two months from advertising for this product , it reaches a really high number of selling ; although it has a bad qeuality .second , i was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone .it appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal .therefore , i bought the cellphone , but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment .in conclusion , an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product .on the other hand , it could be used in a good or a bad way .however , some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >
