today in japan , i think some young people dont help their communities .i think it is because they are not interesting in their lives .some people say that they dont have much time to spend helping communities but i think those are just the reason why they dont want to do it .so i think they should be interested in their community and give enough time to helping their communities to see their lives again .some communities have some problems .i think the most biggest common problem is the environment .i am interested in these environment so i do want to know about these problems and want to think what i can do for communities .these environment problems are very important today i think , because those are depending on our lives and they are relative to our future lives .so i think that people have to consider about these problems again of course , but young people should be in mind these problems becasue young people will make our future life so that they should give enough time to helping thier comminuties .these a little helping can make our communities better .having siad that , some people against my idea because studying or playing sports or doing what they like are also important .however , i think young people can give more time to helping considering their communities because young people s infuluences are very big so that if they more pay attention to their community , i think their communities will be better .in conclusion , young people should see thier lives again and they should consider what they can do for the future .so i disagree with this statement .
