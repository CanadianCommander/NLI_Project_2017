the world is on a rapid pace .everyone is determined to try something new and employ larger and larger risks .it surely get results to some and failure to many .in my opinion , people who have achieved success can definately try and work on more things and get involved with the element of risk .they would be better off doing things they were into all this while but the crave to achieve more will not help them settle for less .firstly , successful people can employ better brains and skilled man power to help working on new things and exploring better avenues .with their past success they sure start believing in more things and are confident in their way of execution .eg : someone like bill gates can employ far better intellect in his business and afford more risks which isnt a trait for someone who is still striving to achieve big .another important thing one should think of and consider when getting into a newer thing is his past experience .a succesfull man stands more chances for better and varied experience and i believe can handle critical decisions and policies better than someone who is a fresher or less experienced .coming to our same example , mr bill gates today with his hard work and experience is in better position to make new business work and employ risk .through his detemination he has explored many more areas since from where he started .moreover , there are lot other priviledges that follows a successful person .not to deny his achievements but he is socially and politically more sound and strong to stand for his new risk and adventure .the urge to try new things might also come from peer influences .lastly i would like to emphasise and support my opinion for successful people but wouldnt want to neglect or limit the potential of any candidate or person on basis of his success .he surely can make it big but a succesful person in my view stands a better oppurtunity and chance .
