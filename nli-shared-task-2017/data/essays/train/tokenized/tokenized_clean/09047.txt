do nt young people care anymore ?have they lost all sense of responsability for their communities ?in recent years it has been often discussed whether or not young people still give enough time to helping their communities .as i can not clearly agree or disagree with the given statement , i will , in the following essay , present arguments for both sides before i draw a conclusion that is partly based on my personal experiences .unfortunately , it is a given fact that young people are less and less involved in their communities : when it comes to local elections it is usually the young people who can not be bothered to vote ; when it comes to helping out at social institutions , young people are hardly seen ; and on sunday mornings usually only elderly people sit down at the local church benches .at first glance it seems like young people are more interested in shopping , playing video games and partying instead of giving some time to their communities .partly , this might be true , but it is definitely not true for all young people .in my personal opinion the young people often are not properly given the chance to play an active and effective role in the society they live in .during my internships at local schools , for example , i would often hear the young students make remarks like the followings : `` nobody cares about what i do , everybody thinks that i am a failure.  , `` nobody is interested in my opinion , i am not capable of changing anything anyways.  , `` why should i care about others , i need to care for myself first ..the reasons for these and similar statements probably are very diverse , for example one reason might be the lacking support and understanding of the parents .if parents fail in teaching their children what it means to be social , it is more likely to meet a young one that does nt care for anybody else but himself .it therefore seems to me that the community and especially the educational system has to make major efforts to prevent such a shortcoming in social skills .communities , for example , should make it easier for young people to get involved instead of complaining that young people are nt interested anymore .for example , the local animal shelter could go to the schools and let the students know that they are in need for people to come walk the dogs , clean the cages , and so on .they should also point out that they need very responsable and honorable students to do the job and encourage the students to give it a try .likewise , other institutuions should ask for help , also .for example , i could imagine that places for retired and sick people would have a great need of young people to spend time with the elderly ones and , in my opinion , the institutions should point out how beneficial such a relationship could be for both parties .also , the community should offer activities for teenagers and young adults , for example regular meetings where they can get together and perform multiple sorts of activities that train intercultural and social competence .i truly believe that , if young people are encouraged , they will gladly devote time to their communities and , thus , one should nt complain about the young ones , but support them a little better .
