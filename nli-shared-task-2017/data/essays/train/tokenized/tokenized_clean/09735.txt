i think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in only one specific subject , and i have three reason for this conclusion .first , let s think about one situation , there were one univ-educateted student and he would work at a conpany , then if he learned many subjects , i think that he could get many types of works and he could show his all abilities .in this case , if he learned only one specific subject , i think that he might do good works , but he could get only one type of work and he could nt show his all abilities .this is mainly reason that i think it .second , i think that large studies might lead the person to a big heart .if you learnd many academic subjects , you might have a big heart enogh to get the subjects .for example , some learnd economics and politics at an university and the other leaned only economics at the same university .the former has a kowledge about politics whether it is deep or sarrow and the latter has no knowledge
