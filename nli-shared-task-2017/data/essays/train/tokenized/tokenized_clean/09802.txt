the statement that young people would enjoy life more than older poeple is to be questioned critically .in our society , especially in media youth and beauty are regarded as some of the most important values .this perhaps is the reason , why this statement is supported by many people .but reality is not the same that mass media wants to tell us .today older poeple have allmost the same possibilities as the young people have .they have a lot of experience in life and play important roles in many families , in society or in the economy .the more conservative part of the older generation helps raising the children or dooing the housework .this return to integration will increase , while our economical system will force young people and also parents to work more flexible and longer .other , less conservative seniors still have important jobs in society , politics and economy and do nt seem to agree to the statement either .the phenomenon of youth as a social vulue was born in our industrialized countries .but the current developement seems to be a change of view on this topic .today people get much older than they did a houndred years ago .achievements in medicine and pharmaceutica allow a longer and much more prosperous life for most people .further threre are less children born to balance the bigger count of older people in our society .the big firms allready realized this developement and defined a new group of customers .they call them `` best agers  .i geuss the name itself implies our societie s future view on the older generation and the older people s on themselves .today and in future the age of a person will no longer determine what to do or how to feel about one s life .
