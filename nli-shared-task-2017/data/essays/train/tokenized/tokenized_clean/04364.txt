it is a indoubtable fact that people get much older these days than in ancient times .though the media try to illustrate the image of a generation of youth where getting old is stigma old people enjoy life more than ever before .these days old people certainly also enjoy life like younger people do .never before the senior generation has had more financial opportunities than it had today .more poeple than ever before have their own houses and homes they live in .whereas young people have to spend huge amounts of their money in building homes or paying rent senior citizen can afford most of their pension for their own needs .furthermore , old people do not have to afford the expensive raise of a child which is an enormous burden for young parents .old people have much more time to spend than young people .due to globalisation young people have to work more and compete with other workers to archieve their goals .mostly beeing retired senior citizens have the time to do everything they want .maybe they could go for a timeefficient hobby or travel to far places of the world a working person could never go to due to the lack of time .thanks to great efforts in modern medicine the older generation can expect to live much longer then we ever did before .doctors nowadays can handle even serious medical problems .the decline in blue-collar workers is also the decline of hard physical work which also led to health problems before .globalisation also made possible to travel to almost each place in the world without problems .affording more money than any other generation before older people often decide to spend their last time of their lifes in their area where they dreamed of when they were younger .neither was a generation before able to do that nor do we know if today s youth will ever have the opportunity to do it .
