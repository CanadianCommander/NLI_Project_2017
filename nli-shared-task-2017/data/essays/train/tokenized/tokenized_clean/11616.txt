new thing gives successmany people believe that if a person wants to be successful , he/she should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with it .although there are many different definations on the term `` successful people  , i believe that if a person does not try new things , he/she would never be successful .there are many successful people as examples for this statement , such as albert enstein and bill gates .albert enstein is one of the most famous and revolutionary physists in history .what has he done , is used his radicular thought on situation with speed of light to contrast with sir isac newton s theory , which is called classical physics and contains most basic theoris on forces at that time .with this contrast , albert enstein established new physical theories .by taking a try on new thoughts , enstein had physical subjects step forward to new generations , and himself became a successful person .he has said : `` imegination is more important than knowledge .as he said , without this creative thought , physics would never have a progress .another successful person i want to show here is one of the richest person in current world , whose name is bill gates .he is the ceo of the biggest software campany , microsoft .with his great sense on the development of computer , he really passes a gate toward bill .when he was still in his teen age , computer was really a rare thing .ignors the objection by his classmate , bill quit harvert university and takes this new thing , and also risks .of course , if he has continuoued his way in havert , he may become a nice lawyer .however , to him , nice means nothing .he does not want to be normal .by running personal computer programming business , which is a new task with new risk at that time , he successed .trying new thing gives him rewards much more then any one can image .not only albert enstein and bill gates are the successful people who have taken new things and risks , the ways of other successful people like plank or schrodinger to success are also trying new things .different people have different ways to success , but successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
