on the one hand , i think that learning facts can be an advantage for students since they can have a sort of role model to help them understand the facts .they can easily learn how to do things by learning what someone before them did .they can easily make out the person s mistakes and see what went wrong and what not to do if they want to succed .but on the other hand , i believe that understanding ideas and concepts is way better for students because if one wants to repeat something , it would be easier for him if he has understood what he wants to do instead of juste copying something he has learned .in that way , he can avoid making the same mistakes .furthermore , he will be able to shape his own personality and we know that it is generally upheld that someone with a lot of personality is better treated than someone plain who just follows the flock .here in france , the way philosophy is taught to students is very peculiar .indeed , in france , students are nt only taught the doctrine of the authors but they are also taught to become philosophers .i know that can sound ambitious and risky but i think that it s an exellent way to shape the students  spirit .instead of just teaching them doctrines that they do nt reaaly care about , they are told what the philosophers said but also what they think about that .they do nt have to simply learn by heart some doctrines that they do nt really understand , they are also askek to react to that doctrine and to say wether they agree or not .i think that s great because no matter how intelligent and brilliant these philosophers were , we ca nt reaaly take all they said for garnted .as students and even as human beings we have to react towards some doctrine sucha as nietzch s .we can really learn what he said and believe that he is right just because he was a smart man .indeed , let s not forget that hitler was inspired by him and used his work in order to justify nazism .furthermore , the great philosopher , aristotle , thought that slavery was natural .all in all , what we can say is that as students , we can take all that our teachers tell us for granted .we absolutely have to think by ourselves and must not simply lear facts .thinking by ourselves will help us in the future for example when we will have to vote .
