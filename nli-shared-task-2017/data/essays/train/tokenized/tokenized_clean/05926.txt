`` it is all about the club , makes your shot have a lifetime expirience  ( wilson golf clubs ) this was an advertisment for a golf club about five years ago .why do i mention it ?well i bought their product .in the modern world that we live in advertisment and marketing are everything inside a free market .adverstisment is an important factor used by producers to sell their products , it makes the consumer become interested in the product and makes him most of the times buy it .bringing my previose quote again what i tried to show with it is that by just listening to a propaganda and its advertisment i became so interested in that club that i finally bought it .i was young and just becoming a part of a famouse hobby called golf .i wasnt aware of what brands were the best and so .so i just bought the one that called the most my attention `` wilson golf clubs .it had a great advertisnment wich assured me that its product will last foreever and that it will make my game improve as a whole .one year later it boke leaving me with no more than a memory .i asked myself why ?well in the business world companies want revenue for greater profits .one way of gaining it is by the means of advertising .if you have a firm that sells shoes who is just beign introduced to the market you imidiatly want money , through advertisment you can trick the consumer into buying youre shoes because they are top quality and they will never get old nor loose their power .through this mean of business you can expand in the market and the only one who could get hurt is youre client with your crapppy product .the world is filled with advertisment cartels and so .we people need to be aware that what we are buying has a good quality because most of the times things arent why they seem nor said to be .
