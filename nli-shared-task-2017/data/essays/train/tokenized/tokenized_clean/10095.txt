i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .maybe most young people do enjoy more of life than older people , but it all depends on each individual s situation of life .some people say one must take advantage and enjoy all life can bring when one is young because once older , there would be not enough time and energy to do so .but this is not necessarily true .it is a fact that as people get older , their bodies get stiffer , but if one exercises regularly , this wo nt happen as quickly as it happens to people who do not exercise at all .and older people might enjoy life more than younger people because they have many benefits that many younger people do not have .such as money , and maturity .one has to have financial backup in order to enjoy some kind of activity because most of the enjoyable activities that we humans seek , require a large amount of money that young people can not afford .a person who enjoys traveling , for example .traveling requires to pay for a variety of advantages such as , a place to sleep in ( hotels , resorts ) , food , souvenirs , tour , and many other activities one is likely to pursue when traveling .one also has to possess enough maturity because only a mature person can completely enjoy of some specific activity or action .since young people are likely to get into any kind of trouble which might instantly lead to displeasure and ruin the enjoying part of any experience .one example might be when one runs out of supplies when traveling again .an older person is more responsible and takes control over all supplies and resources that might be needed in any occasion , and enjoy at the same time .but most young people can not maintain the balance between enjoying and controlling .one young person might have taken a certain amount of money with him but spent all the money on entertainment for example .and end up without anything to eat for a whole day maybe .there are many other examples proving that most older people enjoy life more than younger people do .because a majority of younger people do not possess what older people do .
