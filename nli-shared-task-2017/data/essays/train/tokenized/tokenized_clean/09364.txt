i do agree with the statement that it s better to understand concept than to learn facts .infact i think that it is nt important to learn event , try to remember them without comprehend them , what you learn has not to be a mixture of information but you need to know causes and explanations of them .for example i can report my personal experience : when i studied at the high school i did nt go on very well with my history teacher because we had differen opinions about this same topic .she believed that students must know everithing happened in the past , battles , important people s lives , dates etc .on the countrary i thought , and i still think , that it is not so important to learn so many informations , i m interested in causes , in important events , not in details : i believe that if you focus too much on details you will lost the main ideas .it is also important to say that it s hard to remember facts while it s easier to remember idea and concepts which are related with themselves and wich have particular causes and effects .some yeas ago i took a course about technique of memory and i learned that to remember something you need to relate it with some other thing .in my experience at school i had the opportunity to verify that it was a true statement !i also think that ideas and conceps can be more utile in life than the kowledge of a particular fact , it is rare that you will need to know a particular fact in the future .what is important to say is that when you understand concepts you understand also a way of thinking , of providing argument to support a thesis .to understand ideas and a way of thinking is much more important than knowing three millions informations or events : you wo nt need to know informations or events if you ca nt relate them .
