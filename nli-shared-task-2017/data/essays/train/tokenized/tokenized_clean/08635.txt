poeple strive for success in many ways .some people specialize in what they already know how to do well .others , however , are brave enough to try new things and take risks .given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society , i agree that successful people are the latter ones who continuoulsy change their paths of life .firstly , trying new things and taking risks often leads people to see new opportunities .the technology and business are changing fast .if people stick to the old ways of thinking , they may be left behind by the society .so we should be open-minded to the new environment .for example , bill gates , the founder of microsoft , took great risks when he decided to quit from university and start his own business .that was indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make .because bill gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation , he gained great success .noy only can we have new opportunities by taking risks , there is also higher rate of return .when people only do what they already know how to do well , they have little room for improvement .thus they can not gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society .in contrary , high risks often implys high rate of return .those who try new things often get more because of the risks undertaken .my marketing professor , for example , changed his career several times from amanager to aconsultant to a professor .he really gains much life experience and at the same time makes good fortune .as stated above , trying new things and taking risks would bring people valuable opportunities and good return .we all live in a increasingly competitive society .that is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves .is exactly the way that leads to success .
