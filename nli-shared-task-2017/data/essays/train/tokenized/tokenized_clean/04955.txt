i disagree to this statement , for few reasons and especially when i am travelling in a new country or area :first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide can be a very limited way to discover a new place .most of the time everything is schedule in advance so no time to meet people , exchange , to really be in contact with the population .the best way to know a country can only be guaranted by taking his time , deciding to stay more time to a very interesting place .a travel with a tour guide does nt give this flexibility , .also , many travel with a tour guide will result by visit very commerical area .i remember doing this kind of trip in quebec , we visited a `` first nations  site near quebec city and by listening to the tour guide , this site was the only place where people was still living like a century ago .but i move in quebec 2 years later and talk about it to my co-workers , and of course i discover it was just an area for the `` touristes  .so what i am trying to explain by this exemple , is the risk to be shown something who is not the reality and to whom the purpose is only the money .finally the last reasons i disagree with this statement , is that only the fact to travel in a group of unknown people is a risk .it s difficult to know how people will react between each other by spending time together for a minimum of a week .
