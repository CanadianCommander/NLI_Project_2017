knowing about the place you are planning to visit is an important thing to do .having enough information allows you to be more confident when the time for you to travel is coming .i usually do this thats why i m not so sure about travelling with a tourist guide as the best option for me .it can be a hard situation for me to adjust my time to a schedule plan , being under pressure makes me feel unconfortable and with not energy to be part of a group even if that group is great and nice .i love being with people i love in a pleasure trip for example , and if i have to be with the time on my back the whole time , i would feel horrible for not enjoy the trip as i wish .i know that a tourist guide gives you a lot of knowledge and experience but i d rather make the travel by my own and be able to know about the things i m interest in .making everything i want and going wherever i want .step by step , not in a rush .that s what i mean by saying that knowing everything i can about the place i m going to visit is so important .also , it feels like a boring situation to me being with a group i do nt even know , i do nt have any idea of how they are and that could be a problem when it comes to share situations and happy moments during the trip .i admit that it can be exciting if i do the trip only by myself but not if i m travelling with the family or a large group of friends .being in a travel with a group is not an option for me in most of the times , but i can say i wo nt do it in the future .
