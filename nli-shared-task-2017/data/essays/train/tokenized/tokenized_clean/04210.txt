in my country i think that it is very difficult to help in communities .the school takes away most of the freetime that a student has .during the past year i have been an `` au pair  in the usa .one of the kids that i was used to take care , a 7th grader , had to help in her communities and do some volunteer work .i know that the school organize this kind of things and i think that is really helpful for life that a kid finds time to help other people .it gives the person time to be with other people , time to talk about the things that are happening around and see what your community needs to be taken care of .i don-t really agree with the statement .because i think that there is not enough time sometimes to help in this really important service .i can speak for myself now saying that soemtimes i cut a little time to help others but in this way i found myself in a hurry to do other important things that had a priority first .i experienced a community service in the states and i had no problem on finding time for that .i had to collect clothes in a tiny community center for a thrift store .it gave me a so much that job that i would recommended to anyone that wants to do a community service .and , there are a lot of other things that would need to take care of , also , some funny things to do with children while their parents are at work or give some help to poor families that doesn-t have somebody that can help them .i agree that many people have time and they don-t care on helping in this kind of services or they prefere to occupy theirselves in other things .but mostly , i think that the main problem is in how the community is organized and in how people expected it to be taken care of .maybe a little bit more of relation between school and services , also used for extra scholastic credits , would make a difference on having more time for students to help in communities .
