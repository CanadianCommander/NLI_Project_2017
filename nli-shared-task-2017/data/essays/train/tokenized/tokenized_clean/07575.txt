actually i disagree , since learning facts is the main part of building an idias or concepts , which will be reflected on the amount of facts they learned .the much you learn and study about facts and information , the much the clear idias will be ready to speak out about .many people sponsered an idais that do not stand or reflect any facts , these will be very fragil and will not found any field of practice since its not factual concepts .so in order to be in the way of good learning way we have to make sure we study the important basics and learn more facts in order to be able and more confedent to have a new idia and getting more advance in the field of knowledge .for me , understanding idias is secondary to learning the other part of facts and information since not all idias are correct or in other way it is still a theory rather than approved facts , so concentrating on this veiw of teaching the student will be more important to be in the side of producing a logical and practical type of mentality and getting more beneficial idias as we reflecting all on facts and concepts .further the more , it is really interesting to explain that facts and concepts are only the way to understand all idias as with out these facts we can not progress to a matter of making theories and adopting a new concept in any field of life .students are more willing to learn when they feel they are standing on a solid base that help them to understand more idias and they can learn fast when they feel more confortable with the way of getting the informatin and this will be through learning facts first the understanding the concepts .
