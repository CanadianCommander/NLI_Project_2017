i disagree that it is more important for student to anderstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .one of the most important fact that students should know is ideas and concepts are not more important that facts .because of tow reasons .the first one is ideas alway can change by the times and place .the science always change a lot of ideas about what we think in the past .for example people think in the past the earth is flat and the sun move around the earth , but with the time science discover that all of that is wronge .the second one is students can not egnore the facts , which other people concloded them in very long time , using large number of reaserches and experince .however there is a lot of ideas change our world by scienses the change there life and humen distiny by good ideas , but that is not a reason to looke to the ideas as afact we should excepted all the time weather its right or wronge .some times people can get a lot of ideas in the same time they will changed .all of these reasons are so important that make students understand that ideas and concepts are not important than facts .
