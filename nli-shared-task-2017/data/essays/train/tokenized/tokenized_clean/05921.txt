nobody knows how young people play more than older people ?even though young people can enjoy like an adult .but , they ca nt completely like a old people .they want to go to another place and they want to eat delicious food .and they want to be an aduly .but we ca nt help them .because , this world have rules .also we have to keep those rules .but young people who is under 21 their law is smaller than adult s low .therefore , they are freedom .if young people have to strong of law , they can not enjoy ther life .also i would like to come back childhood .just imagine !if one family go to picnic or vacation , their children what are they doing ?may be , they will play .but their parents will work like a make a food or convey their carry .also , their parents have to spend a money .their parents need a money for a vacation .that s too bad .anyway , they have to make a money .their children use thier parents money .therefore , they enjoy their life more than older people do .that was what i am thinking .
