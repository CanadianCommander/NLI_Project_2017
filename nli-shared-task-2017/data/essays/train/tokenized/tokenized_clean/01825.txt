i strongly agree that in the next twenty years , more or less , there will be less cars in use than currently are .or , at least , those cars will mainly use some clean sustainable energy source , other than oil .i think there are several reasons to support this forecasting .on the one hand oil sources are going to be exhausted most probably , in the next fifty years .moreover , roads are currently already collapsed by car traffic .also , people are becoming increasingly awared about critical environmental problems of air pollution and other types of contamination .what about oil pools .although oil industry is a very lucrative business and enterprises are main interested about benefits , rather than environmental safety , a change in the type of energy sources they use is mandatory because of scarcity of oil that in some years will prevent from using this energy for cars engines .this might explain why some car industries have already made cars with a hybrid engine that uses electricity and oil at the same time .regarding traffic roads , it is evident that any big city or even small town has to deal with daily problems imposed by a number of cars that overwhelm their phisical possibilities .transportation by car has become a very difficult task at any hour in our cities .people are now more concerned about their health and environmental problems caused cars .and
