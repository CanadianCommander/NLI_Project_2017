i disagree with statement about to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects rather specializing in one specific subject .it is always better to have one subject to get specialised more because it makes the person strong enough to compete for certain jobs which especially requires specialization in some particular subject .i have presented some examples below to support my arguement .i have got two friends who are studying their undergraduation in `` mechanical  , `` mechatronoics  as their majors .the subjects involved in mechanical are purely related to concepts based on mechanical .but the subjects involved in mechatronics are related to mechanical , electronics , little bit of computer science , i.e mechatronics is a combination of the subjects .when my both friends completed their undergraduation in their respective fields , i observed that the person who done his major in mechanical were able to hire or get the job easily .in case of other friend this has not happened .here he is eligible to attend the companies which requries mechanical .electronics , computerscience background knowledge independently , that sounds to be more specification in the subjects mentioned above .here my friend was unable to pursue the job as he lacks more knowledge in depth to be required for a particular company .therefore for every individual it is essential to have an keen thorough knowledge or specialization in particular academic subject rather than having a broad knowledge on many subjects .this case can better be explained in case of field of doctor s profession .as we all know that a doctor who is specialized in one particular organ of our human body , say eyes , heart , kidney etc. , are more valuedand paid than the doctors who have got enough knowledge on all aspects of the human organs .this is the reason why kidney specialists , heart specialists etc. , have more fame than other doctors who do nt have any specialization degree in any organs of oyr human body .
