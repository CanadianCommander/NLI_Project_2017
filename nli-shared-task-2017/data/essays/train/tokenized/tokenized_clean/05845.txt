i disagree because traviling with a group led by a tour guide is abad idea for my thinking .first when someone is travilng with a group led by a tour guide , itmakes him or her being controlled , so he or she ca nt have the ability to move freelly .for example , if someone needs to go to therestroom , every one should wite for that person until he or shefinishes .and also if someone does nt like the place or has been tothe place that group are going to , he or she should go with the group .the second reason is that travilng with a group could beunhealthy in someone s health .when someone travels with a group ,he or she may have healthy problems that could transfear tosomeone in the group .for example , if someone has inflo , it cantransfear ( go ) to someone in the group easlly .the third reason that when someone is traviling with a group thetravel based on a plan .when a group travels , it has a ready plan .so , whensomeone wants to change his mind about a place , he ca nt changethe plan he should go with the plan or leave the group after payingsome money .for example , if someone changes his mind aboutvisitng a musume with the group , he ca nt change the plan fromvisiting the musume to visit the zoo .so he should go with the groupby rhe plan or leave the group after paying some money .all in all , as you see , traviling with a group is a bad idea becauseof the ability of moving , the health and changing the mind .i thinkwhen someone wants to travel , he or she should go by themselvs .
