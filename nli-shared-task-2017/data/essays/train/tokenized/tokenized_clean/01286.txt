these days , there are the growing numbers of people tring to enjoy their life in various way .some peeple say the young people enjoy life more than older people do , while others disagree with this .in my oppinion , i disagree with the statement because i think the older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling the world and playing sevral kinds of sports .first of all , old people enjoy their life by traveling many different countries .as you may find on researchs of sevral tv stations , the number of people traveling other countries than thier own countries are highly increasing every years , and most of them are seniors who do not have particular jobs while other are busy to care their business than enjoying their life .due to they do not have their job to spend most of their time , they get a lot easier to travel arround and enjoy thier life .secondly , the older people enjoy thier life by playing many kinds of sports .with the development of medicine and health supplies , older people are getting much more stronger than before .these developments help older people to maintain their body condition enough to participate many sports activities .for instance , i have seen many seniors playing squarsh game very well while i work out at my fitness club .as i mentioned before , they have much more time than younger poeple who have to work hard to keep up thier jobs .thus , older people can spend more time to consider what kinds of sports they like to learn , and how they are going to enjoy their life too .in conclusion , i disagree agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i think older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling arround and learning and playing many sports .if people have more spare time when their are young , they can enjoy life more .however , they are still busy to work hard .
