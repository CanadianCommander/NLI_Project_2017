how many times do you see advertisements a day ?recently we live in the flood of advertisements and it is true that sometimes they can be very useful information to buy something new .however , it is not good to trust every fact which is in the advertisement .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .showing their product seem better than they really are can be considered as a marketing strategy .there are too many products which have the same function in the world , and if they want to sell their products , they need to make the advertisement of their product which has the same function but has to seem much better than other products .the problem is from that point .they decide to lie in order to sell their product more and the customers who buy that product wil be cheated .i had an experience to buy a set of equipments for cooking .in the television advertisement , it looked like magic .show-hosts could to everything with those eqipments easily and it worked very well on tv .and also the product was much cheapper than other products which were selled in real shops .however , i could not do anything well with the same equipments .the knives which had special purposes were worse than a knife which i had used before them , and i could use several types of pots and pans only for two or three months .and then , i had to buy new equipments .even though it is true that advertisements are necessary to show someone s products widely and easily , there should be only truth in the advertisements .
