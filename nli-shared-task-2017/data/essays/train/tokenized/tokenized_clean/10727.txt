i would have to say that the best way to travel is being your own tour guide .i personally like to explore places by myself , i am curious and i am not afraid to take risks .to me sounds boring just to think about the idea of traveling with a group of people and depend on somebody else s schedule and not on my own .when people travel with a tour guide they usually depend on the guide s schedule during the whole trip , and that could be one of the inconveniences .for example , in a group of people of different ages , the older ones would agree with some situations while the younger probably would not .if they have to follow a guide they have no choice to change the schedule and avoid doing things or going to places where they are not comfortable .personally , when i travel somewhere , i like to explore the place by myself , get a map , take a train and find places without having to follow somebody that already knows where to go and what to do .if i end up getting lost in an unknown place it is not a problem for me , on the other hand , it is fun !i like to explore cultures by knowing how their people behave .for example , during my last trip to rome i discovered the most friendly people i have ever had contact with before .i was lost for 3 hours , and even though i had a map and i knew how to find my way , i started asking for directions to people on the road , and i really loved the fact that they would stop no matter for how long and talk to me , try to help me in the most friendly way , and that is an experience i really enjoyed .to me , that is the only way someone can really enjoy visiting a new place : taking risks and exploring .it is also more expensive to travel having a touristic guide .sometimes we save money for a long time to get a chance to travel somewhere and it is not worth it to spend a considerable amount of that money paying somebody who is going to show us the place and probably talk about relevant historical passages of that part of the world if we are able to get a book and read about the same topic and take a train or any transportation media to get wherever we want by ourselves .the best way to travel is to go without planning too much .in my opinion it is more exciting the unexpected : being in a new place , getting to talk to local people , following my own schedule without having to think about what time is it , discover places by myself and have a really fun story to remember forever .
