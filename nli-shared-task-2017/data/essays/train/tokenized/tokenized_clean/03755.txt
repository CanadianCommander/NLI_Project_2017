advertisements should present a product on an objective way but most of them make products seem much better than they really are .by definition an advertisement should make the public buy the product and so present only his better aspect and properties .moreover , since they are a lot of company producing the same product they should emphasize the properties of their product .and eventually , there are always differences between a photo or a film and the real product .first , the purpose of an advertisement is to create a need by convincing the client that he should have this product .therefore the product should be perfect without any disadvantages .but reality is different .for example when you buy a computer , advertisement show you computers as objects everybody should have .you could have access to internet , a lot of information , it will simplify your life .however , they never tell you that sometimes the computer should have some problems like virus , that by using it for buying some products on internet people could see your credit card number .all the bad aspect of the computer are forgotten .nowadays , in our society there are a lot of companies producing the same product .so each company have to make the difference with the others by emphasizing the properties of their product .they should show that their products is better than those of the others .for example , cleaning product for cloths all clean the clothes .but one company will show you that our product is better than the other one for several reasons such as using less product .eventually , there are always differences between photo or film they made that are taken in the perfect condition to make the product seems perfect and the product that you received .for examples the color of clothes are sometimes different due to light .so you could see on the television a perfect black skirt and eventually have a grey skirt .as a conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are by emphasizing their properties , not talking aboute the inconvenients and showing the product in the perfect conditions that you couldny have .however in the way we always want perfect products are nt we a bit reponsible of this phenomenom ?
