in every country we go , there is a large number of cars , but this figure will decrease in the future .i think that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .nowadays there are so many cars in the world that we will be forced to abandon them in the future .there are certain factors that i want to point out that will favour this decrease .first of all , i think that it will be imposible for everyone to have a car .the car prices but specially the petrol prices will go up steadily in the future : the fuel is going up and up everyday , but it will get worse as they become scarce .petrol prices are expensive now but they will be impossible to pay for a large number of people .the pollution will be another factor that will decrease the number the cars in our streets .we all have to be aware of the dangers of the pollution that cars produce .the car smoke is one of the key factors of pollution in many countries .in is important to bear in mind that we are damaging the planet and soon this damamge will become irreversible .also , in a more practical approach , traffic will act a deterrent for many car buyers in large cities .in the future , it will be impossible to drive in the cities and more and more people will use the public transport .although there are many citizens using the public transport , it seems that figures will increase every year .regarding the public transport , citizens should put more pressure on government so they create an effective public transport network .in my opinion , if this objective is accomplished , people would rely in the public transport and would abandon the need of the car .in conclusion , i think that in twenty years there will be less cars in our streets than there are today .i think that we will need to consider these points in order to use or not use our cars .
