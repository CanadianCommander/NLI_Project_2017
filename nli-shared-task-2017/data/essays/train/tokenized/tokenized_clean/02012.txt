the cycle of life has not changed since the begining of the time .every humanbeing borns , grows and dies ; but the most important thing in this preiod of time is to fill out your life in the most proper way which fits to you .every period of this life cycle has it s own rules and conditions .when you are a child you are not able to do whatever you want ; furthermore when you are a baby you are even not able to tell what you want .this cycle of life may seem a little bit unfair to us but actually it is not .at that period none of us has to take responsbility or none of us has to work for earning money , so may be those times were the easiest and most favorable parts of our lives .if you are in the middle period of your life cycle ; i mean if you are a young person , you are able to do lots of things without permissions , warnings or even concerns .as i mentioned before while you are young you are able to do whatever you want and even stupid or risky thinks ; but in this case one important limitation comes into play , which is your metabolism .as a perspective explanation ; people are allowed to do things as long as their health and metobolism let them .if you are a young person without disabilities ; there exists about nothing to stop you or prevent you from enoying the life .you can go to swimming , you can go to scuba diving and you can even try bungee jumping ; but we all have to remember that we have only one limitation which is our health .on the other hand if you are getting older and , if it has been a while since you passed the boundary line of middle cycle of your life ; it means that you are not that strong as you were at your previous years .in this cycle people start to loose their strength and energy , moreover their metabolism gets slower and slower day by day .this of course does not mean that these kind of people are not able to enjoy , but at the same time it means that noe these people have some health limitations and not able to do whatever that they want now .in conclusion everybody in the world can enjoy the life ; but of course not in the same ratio or amount .and who can deny that young people have a big advantage under these circumstances ?
