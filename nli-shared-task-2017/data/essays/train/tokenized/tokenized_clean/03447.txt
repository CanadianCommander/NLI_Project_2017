from my point of view , a successfull person is someone who succeed in his life , someone who hit his goal , his objectives .for my concern , i vote for the safety , that is to say that to if you always do what you already know how to do well , you will get more and more experience in the sector you re working on .you ll specialize yourself , become an expert , and so as a matter of fact , will be successfull .let s take an exemple , someone who has just started to work , he s just started his professional life , generally he is going to do what he already knows , so , if he keeps working in his domain , he ll become an expert .but on the contrary , if he starts trying new jobs , specially in something he does nt know anything about , he s taking too much risks , and he may not succeed as well as if he would have stayed in his domain and specialized himself .this previous exemple implies someone who s just started to work , but let s talk about someone who had already a wealthy life and a good job .he decides to vary his occupations by trying new things , things which he is completly unfamiliar with .suppose that he manages to succeed in all of his new occupations , we ca nt deny the fact that among all of his activities , if one day there is any problem that pops and that he ca nt find any solutions .from one little problem he could lose lots of money by trying to save his affair , or even selling it .so , through those two exemples , i disagree completely with this statement .the only situation where i could agree , is that the person concerned , can afford itself taking those risks by trying new activities .i mean if he has a really good business and a safety bank account that ca nt be going down .but the safety is my priority for a successful person .
