our world develops rapidly nowadays .cars , buildings and other things around us change from time to time , some times for better and some times for wose , i think that in twenty years the world will have major changes , especially in the transfomation technology .i agree on the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the car technology is impoving rapidly and each year we hear about more developed version of the car , however , nowadays people are concerned about the invironment and how cars can affect it negatively .so , alogside the developments , i think that car manifacturers will take this problem into account and think about creative ways to prevent invironment problems and solve them , such as : pollution .in my prediction , i see the world in an optimistic eye twenty years from now , i think that cars will be replaced by less harmfull transformation devices , such as : a developed vesion of a bike or even skates .there is also a possiblity that car factories may create cars with wings or small air-plains which will keep the cars off the earth .another reason why i think that there will be fewer cars in use , is the economy and the oil prices .the demand on oil will increase which will make it s price increase , the high proces of oil may make people think of other transportation devices .plus , the oil resources may stop producing , because their is a possiblty that oil may finish in the future and cars depend on oil in order to run .in conlusion , i tottaly agree on the fact that cars in use will be fewer in twenty years , and i believe that it is an advantage for our world as well as our invironment .
