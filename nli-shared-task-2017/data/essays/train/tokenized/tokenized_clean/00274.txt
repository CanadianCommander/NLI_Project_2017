i agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .followings are my reasons and example .social competition is serious today , in order to survive in society , most young people have to spend most of their time on school .after classes , they have to study for exams and work on term papers .therefore , i do nt think they get time left to help ; sometimes it is not enough for sleep .another reason is that young people may think it makes them sound old if they help the community .as we know , most of the work in communities is done by old people who have been retired .in order not to be regarded as one acting oldly , young folks avoid to do so .take myself for example , i am 21 and admit i do not give enough hours , but i am not like people i illustrated in the third paragraph .often i go to the community library to help out the librarians .due to the lack of hours , i can only go there once a month , for i have to prepare for my school work .sometimes people are just being too busy to help rather than unwilling .in addition to what i mentioned above , there is still a limitation for young people to help their community , that is , there is no pay .it is a of waste of time to doing things without wages .tuition fee is extremely high today , young people have to earn more money to pay .therefore , people would rather work a part-time job than community work .
