the issue at hand is that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities  .i totally agree with this statement because in todays world man is a very busy animal .for him ` time is money  .therefore , man can not devote more of his time to various other soacial activities .firstly , i agree to the statement because life is too fast in todays scientific world .man today has many personal and professional responsiblities .he has to live up to the expectations of many and so he needs to be hardworking and enthusiastic in his work .this does nt allow man to work more for his community .seconly , there is a lot of competition in today s world .for example , students going to college have to do better in their academics as well as in extra-curricular activities because the jobs demand for students who are all-rounders .as a result student spend much of their time studying , doing projects , organizing events in college etc .this leaves them with no choice but sacrifice to the help they could provide to their communities .additionally , todays youth prefer to stay independent .they prefer being financially independent .as a result people along with studies even do part time jobs .this demand of time for one self has made man less interactive with his own people .as the saying goes `` god made man , man made money , money made man mad  , this statement rightly proves that todays youth is more concern about personal benefits than doing something for others .another reason , why i feel the youth is can not help their communities is lack of appreciation .this can be inferred at times when the changes the young people would like to bring in either organizing a event or festival in their community the people are not ready to accept changes as a result the young people prefer spending less time for communities .therefore , i conclude that man has become much more responsible towards himself than others and the various reasons above justify that young people do not give much time to helping their communities .
