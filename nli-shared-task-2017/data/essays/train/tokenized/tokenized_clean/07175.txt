a person is a student for all of his  her life because learning process continues in all life .a learned issue can be forgotten in a long time period .the fact that if the person know the main idea of the topic he  she would not forget it easily .so i agree with the statement that express understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than it is for them to learn facts .i agree with the following statement because of several reasons .firstly , when a student learns the idea or concept it is more stable because the main points are learned by understanding the idea .for example , in a math class a boy can forget about a formula .by using the prove method he could reach again the formula .so it shows that he get the idea-which means the prove method - and using the idea he reached the fact-the formula .secondly , without understanding the ideas and concepts its hard for a student to learn facts .it is a weak way of learning .actually it is named as memorizing .memorized information can not last long .but the information which a student learn is neccessary for his  her education life .for example , a memory of historic information can be forgetten in a several dayes .but if a student get the idea with a small practice he  she would not forget it easily .on the other hand understanding ideas or concept is not enough sometimes .as an example you can know how to prove a formula but if you dont know the formula then your idea learning means nothing .as an conclusion understanding ideas or concepts is more important for student than learning facts .the learned information can be forgetten but the understood information will last longer / .
