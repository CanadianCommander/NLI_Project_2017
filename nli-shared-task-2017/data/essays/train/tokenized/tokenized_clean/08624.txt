i would say that i do not agree neither disagree with both of the statements .personally i think that the truth is in the middle , as also the romans used to say .ideas and concepts in order to be well explained need some facts to be related to .an idea could be difficoult to be explained , but with a fact , an example , the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to be memorized .as an example , i can speak about the french revolution .what was the idea at the base of the french revolution ?accorsing to this subjects , in a class many idea can be explained by the teacher ( i would add in a boring way ) .supporting ideas with facts ( for example explained the idea that led to the killing of the king ) would be more interesting for students and also more beneficial for their learning .many ideas can be well explained , but to really understand them , we need to surround ideas with facts , interesting facts , i would add .another example in which facts have to be strictly related to ideas is for example if you want to descride a marketing concept to a student .of course the idea is really important because everytihg starts from an idea , but also in this case in order to support the idea we need to drawn some conclusion speaking about facts .of course i am speaking about old ideas , becuase what i stated before clearly do not match with new ideas .how is possible speaking about a subjective theme like marketing and separate the idea at the base of a marketing campaing from the results ( the facts ) .in conclusion i would say that what i described is my opinion the best way of how to teach .i do not believe neither in class full of ideas , neither in class full of real facts .as already stated both are importants , but also more interesting is the connection between them .
