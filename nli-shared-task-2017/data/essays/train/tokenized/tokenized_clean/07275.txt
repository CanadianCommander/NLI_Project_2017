the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  is a very interesting one & at the same time a really controversial one to say .it is interesting because this is a statement about two different age groups & controversial because enjoying life may be different for a old person compared to a young person .i disagree to this statement because i think enjoyment is different for different people .it is a personal feeling which does not only vary with age but also varies with each indivisual .maybe for someone partying will seem enjoyment and for someone else camping will be good enough to feel happy .there are a lot of people whom we come across , who are old but still enjoy life as much as a young person .it may seem that for a grown up person life becomes very complex , but it is no different for a young person as he/she also get to know about the complexities of life while they are growing up .it is not easy for them to face the challenges that life presents them everyday .life has never been easy for anyone and never will be .everyone has their own issues .no one in this world is perfect .i feel different people have different yardsticks to measure happiness .enjoyment comes to you when you feel happy and satisfied and are not regretting any decision you have made .even if you have done something regretfull you should try to make up for it and be upto the task of facing the consequences .this gives immense satisfaction to the mind .to conclude i would say that it is not your age which determines enjoyment but you yourself and how possitive you are about life .so just be possitive , work hard and enjoyment will follow you .
