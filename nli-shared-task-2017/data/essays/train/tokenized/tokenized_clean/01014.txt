i think that economical growth is strictly connected to improvements in people s creativity , that lead to new innovative solutions .i think that experiments can turn a man into a successful person .for example , when i arrived in my current newsroom as law reporter , the rivalry with my collegues spurred me to find new solution in order to reach better results .i suddenly noticed that my older coworker were too attached to obsolete idea and were not really interested in radical improvement , but i went forward with my ideas .i tried new types of telecommuting , from internet to laptop to digital photo camera in order to provide my articles in real time .the outcome was amazing : the productivity increase of 60 % and we were able to print more pages with better articles , thanks to the new speed of working .one time i had to take high risks that , fortunately , turns out in amazing results .i used undercover brand new tecniques , unknown in the history of the journalism in asti , my hometown , and i could unveil the biggest political scandal ever occured there .ten actors were provided with bugs and i eavesdropped drug bargains between a well-known mobster and a group of corrupted politicians .a prosecutor , on the base of the evidences collected by me and my assistants , took a successful judiciary action against these criminals .however , sometimes an experiment of new things can turn into a failure .before wright s brothers , a lot of scientists tried to built a plane but they died during the tryout of the devices .and some inventors , like antonio meucci , did nt reach success .infact , he actually invented the telephone but the merit was taken but another person , graham bell .in conclusion , i keep to strongly believe that being open-minded is always a success , even if it does nt make you richer or
