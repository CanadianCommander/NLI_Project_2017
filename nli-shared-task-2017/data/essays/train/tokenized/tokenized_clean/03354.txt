i agree that most adertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , the purpose of advertisements have already decided their nature - to attract more customers , no matter how to get it done .businesses want their advertisements to make a good impression to people , and to lead people to believe that their products are better than others .i have found numerous ways that businesses use to achieve this purpose .some advertisements intentionally give you the `` good points  of a product while hiding the actual , sometimes more important , limitations or disadvantages of the product .for example , some credit card company claims in its advertisements that its credit card service has 0 % apr ( annual payment to the service ) .however , when customers subscribe to the service excitedly , they find that there are actually other fees with different names associated to the service , which are not mentioned at all in the advertisements .in this way , the company successfully lead people to believe that their service is cheaper than others , while in fact it might be more expensive .another way to trick the people watching advertisements is to make invalid or incomplete comparisons with other companies  products .for example , some computer retailer compares his computers with the computers being sold by another retailer .however , it only compares the features that his computers are better at , while ignoring other important features that might limit the performance of them compared to the other product .however , people who watch this advertisement often have no expert knowledge of what features are important to computers , thus getting tricked to believe what the advertisements say .sometimes , advertisements even use deceptive means to attract customers .for example , a clothes-selling store gives an advertisement that it will give a sale on saturday .it then lists several prices of certain clothes compared to their prices a few days ago .however , the store actually increased the original price to make a bigger difference in the prices , which deceives customers .there re many more ways that advertisements exploit to make their products better than they really are .in fact , most advertisements do .
