cars have been considered to be one of the most important inventions of mankind , which went a long way in enhancing his mobility .today they have been transformed from the status of a luxury to that of a necessity .it is for this reason that there has been a noticeable surge in the number of cars .however , twenty years hence , the scenario would be quite different , and i firmly believe that the present day volume of cars is just the tip of an inverted ` u  and would defnitely go down in the time to come .the foremost reason why i believe that the number of cars would be less two decades later is based on the present day status of fuels .the utilization of petroleum resources is already at a considerably high level and their cost has seen a high increase in the last one decade .the exorbitant price of the fuel would definitely deter the consumers to go for cars .adjunct to this , this premise is based on the their very availability ; given the fact that petroleum is a non-renewable sources of energy , it might just become extinct in two decades .one might resort to other fuels like hydrogen and fuel-cell based cars , but they are yet to go a long way in terms of their popularity among the general public .secondly , with rising pollution levels , the government might resort to taking preventive measures by putting a ceiling on the number of cars owned by an individual .it might even consider to discourage the buyers simply by raising the tax slabs .an average consumer , thus , might look for alternate means to commute .emanating from the same argument , the government might also take some positive steps , like making public transport more efficient .a meticulously designed and managed chain of public transportation systems likes buses and local trains would certainly encourage even the car owners to opt for them .i also presume that two decades later most offices would switch from the time-consuming ` manual  mode of functioning to an ` electronic  way .with excellent internet based working environment , one might not need to commute at all ; added to that everybody would be highly accessible .hence , such a work environment would also imply a lessening of the reliance on cars .the preceding assertions have been put forward in context of the supply side of the story ; on the consumers  side too there would be some changes in their perception .cars would no longer remain a status-symbol .people would become increasingly aware of the ill-effects of pollution and would surely like to contribute their share in reducing it by decreasing the use of car as their prerferred mode of trasnportation .in general , an overall increase in the level of awareness of the users would in itself lead to a decline in the number of cars .taking all these points into consideration , i can say with a good degree of confidence , that the number of cars would definitely decline in the future .afterall , all of us want to make this earth a better place to live in .
