i completely agree with that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subcject .i have allways been someone who interests into on several academic subjects such as politics , astronomy , byology and phsycology .it was not possible in my unioversity to study all of these subjects art the same time therefore , i choosed the politics as a major .i believe in that i would be able to be quite succesfull on all of them at the same time .choose of major at univ. depends on persons individual interests besides other less influental reasons .however , it can not be restricted by only one subject .a person can be succesfull on several subjects rather than one spesific one , such as most of the scientist in history .da vinci was not only a paint but also an inventor of his age .on both of these fields his succes can not be ignored .specialize in only one spesific sucject allways sounds me boring .sometimes working on a person having phsycologic problems can be more enjoyable than study a physical promblem .likewise , study for politics can be boring than working on a person s phsycological problem .therefore it can be said that we can rest while working on a different subject than the subject we had to work on much .business life in my country doesnt shape with the science indeed .you can be a good phsycs resarcher but that doesnt help you to make your life easily .in order to earn money knowledge on several subjects is more useful , especially in my country .thats why most of the students tries to make mba in all around the world besides their own major .consequently it can be said that knowldge of several academic subject is definetely better than specialize on only one specific subject .even though many other of the reasons to work on several subjects can be added so , only three of them described above .we can gain more benefits with the broad knowledge on many subjects rather than one academic subject .
