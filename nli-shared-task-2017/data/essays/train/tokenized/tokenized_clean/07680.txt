living in a crowded city with an undeniable traffic problem is getting worse each day .being a part of this tarffic jam the cars generally save our lives to get from one place to another .it is really an easy way to get out from our houses and use our cars to transport .but remembering this ; just one person in a car going to his/her work makes us crazy especially in the mornings .in our daily life some of us use public transportation .there are many busses or other vehicles but besides most of the people use their own cars to get to work or somewhere else .the cars are getting more and more each day and this causes great problems .more car accidents , more air pollution , more noises etc .the government works for this problem to make a solution and it is very useful .now a days people are learning to use public transportation .after all people should agree using undergrounds it woud be helpfull to us .using an underground or a bus or getting to work with your own car but with some friends of yours , also would be a possible solution for the traffic jam .people will do these things when they realise that this is usefull but this will take time unfortunately .i think that as the time passes the traffic is not going to be a problem because in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in the beginning some people will not agree but after some time i think they will see the truth .living in a world without a traffic and a clear weather will be more enjoyable .people will slowly understand that using public transportation will make their life easier .so as the time passes maybe this will help us to communicate with each other in crowded places we will be living in a world all the people understanding each other .
