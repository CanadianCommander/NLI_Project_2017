in my opinion , as a student , it is very important to go deeply to parsue the knowledge in my major .however , it is also important to learn and have broad knowledge in different acadimic subjects .from my own experience , it is very crucial for me , as computer science student , to learn more and more in my major .this knowledge makes me proffessional and expert in my specialization and this in turn will benify me .for example , my grades will be high and when i graduate , i ll have the apportunity to continue my study .even more , if i want to work in a university or any other companies , i think it will be easy .on the other hand , the scociety , that i am living in , is not only computer science .there are many other sciences and topics i have to be a ware about .for instance , i can not imagine that i ll sit with my friends and other people talking about some topic and i know nothing about it !so , it is important also to have broad knolwedge about many acadimic subjects .unfortunately , in my university it is not allowed to take subjects out of my field .if they allow that , i ll be really happy to take subjects in accounting , art , and history .in conclusion , it is important to go deep in your major and parsue every new in it .but also it is necessary to have broad knowledge that ables you to communicate with other people .
