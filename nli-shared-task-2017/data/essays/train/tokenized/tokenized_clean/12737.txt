i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn fact , and i will take a controversary example , which is history .first , when you learn history , it is important to be able to give their relative importance to the different facts .for example , it is impossible to understand different facts of french political life , such as the popular front , without any idea of what the left and the right mean .moreover , sometimes ideas happen to inform reality .it would be absurd to learn a factual history of the ussr or the history of the cold war without any idea of what communism is .more profoundly , there is no discourse about facts without an interpretation of the facts .nietzsche and , more recently , michel foucault have explained that all the facts are constructed .there are no `` natural facts  that we should examine without a theory .even the selection of the facts reveals an idea of what is important and what makes history .economics provides us with countless examples of theories that are necessary to explain facts , and even to construct them .however , it does to mean that there is no escape to general relativism , and that there is no necessity to learn fact .it is important to cast light on the hypothesis that are made in economics as well as in history , but it is also important to give some information about the facts .at the same time as they improve their critical view , students should be able to learn precise facts .to take another time the example of history , the chronology is very important : it would not make sense to explain the facism thinking that it occured before world war i. as far as economics is concerned , it is important to test empirically economic theories to demonstrate that they are useful to understand real economic relations .
