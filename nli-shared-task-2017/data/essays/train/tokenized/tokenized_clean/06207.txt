i completely disagree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for 3 reasons .first , i often see many products written `` no fat  or `` no chemical  on the paccages .when i bought some pack of yogult written `` no fat  on their paccages and ate one of them , i felt that it was too sweet to eat and it must contain fat .second , the advertisements want to increase benefit .if they put some words that fascinate consumers on their products , the consumers would buy them ; even though , those words are actually not real .especially for the consumers who are interested in health or environment .finally , many consumers always try to buy better products .the advertisements know that , so they put fascinative words on the paccage .these are because that i think the advertisements do nt make better products than they really are .i want to them to make the believable products .
