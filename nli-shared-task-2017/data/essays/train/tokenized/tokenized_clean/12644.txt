it is a controversal issue that which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .some people say that students learn facts because it s easy to memorize about something .but in my opinion , students have to learn ideas and concepts about something because of two reasons .first of all , learning ideas and concepts are a basic way to understand everything .if they just memorise facts about something , for example , maybe at that time they think they know everything .but after that if they met some problem that are simmiller with something that they just learned , they will not be able solve the proble because they just learned not basic ideas and concepts but the fact about something .which means they do nt know how to solve the problem and how to think to find the way .second , if students learn ideas and concepts about something , it makes students can more creative than that they just learn facts .for instance , if students learn about a car and understant ideas or concepts about how to move the car , after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bus .also , they will think about other transportation like a train or subway and think about their work .maybe these thinking ways make students more creatively .in conclusion , because of reaons that i above mentioned , students have to understand ideas and concepts when they learn about something .it is a best way to understand and also it helps students think about everyting creatively .
