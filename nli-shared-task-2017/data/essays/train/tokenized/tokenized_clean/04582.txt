a major physics break through was made when einstein suggest a brand new theory dealing with relativity .this innovative vision was a success and einstein had strong physics basis .do we need a real ceasure to succeed in one area or do we need to evolve gently to reach a key point ?first , let s explain how seeking excellence can bring us to a success .for example , the computational fluid dynamics activity needs real mathematics and fluid physics knowledges so a person can then think about a revolutionnary concept .by focusing on one point , we can try different methods to bypass it .working on something wellknown helps thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics  properties .people who keep doing well what they know are gathering knowledge , experience so they are recognized by other people for this and often called , needed to explain , show , develop this subject .finally , as a third point , shall i mention that taking risks is not really allowed when working on a nuclear plant or when driving a war , as human lives are at stakes .but , many battles were won by using surprising methods like the horse made of wood during the greek troyes war .more over , taking space between a concept and our work can lead us to borrow ideas from other areas , like using mathematics for urban planning optimisation .and this make the concept work .however , an other reason of taking risks is that most people have too much fear about risking anything they already have .so you are distinguishing yourself from others and then appear , when succeeding , as a successfull person .to summarize , acquiring excellency in one particular field is the first step of a successfull story .then , an innovative concept would make the difference between success and daily wotk .
