will the advertisements make products seem much better than they reallt are ?i m going to have to say that i agree with this statement because i am one of the people who watches advertisement show and buy products that i want .i do nt think this is a good way to choose which products to buy , but how are we going to buy the products without an advertisements ?and why dose it make products seem much better than they really are with advertisement ?the answer is really simple , it s just that some compnay make look the products better in advertisements .basically what they are doing is lieing .in oreder to find a good products without using the advertisements , people should ask their friends about the products they want to buy .one day , i bought this watch that was said in the advertisements that this watch never brakes and could hold on to great amount of gravity .when i went into the deep pool , it was broken .i was really sad and mad at the same time .advertisements make the products sound better , but the product it self is nt good as what is said on the advertisements .since the product it self is nt good as it says on the advertisements , the company who pruduce the products would not make a great amount of money .like i said in the beggining , i do agree with the statement , but i do nt agree using the advertisements to sell the products .without a advertisements , it would tough for the compnay to sell .same as people who wants to buy the products .for doing this , only the good products which costs less and has good quality is going to be sold .what is the purpose of making an advertisements ?customers could be the advertisments .
