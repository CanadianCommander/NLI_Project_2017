i agree with this statement because of following reasons .first , it is natural that advertisements make products seem better than they really are because the advertisements want to sell their goods .second , i always look forward to seeing new products  advertisememts because it is really fun for me as a customer .if the advertisements show real prodcuts to consumers , i think the advertisemant company havs difficultis in capturing consumers  attention , and geeting a lot of money .indeeed , that the advertisements do not give consumers to ther real products looking is not so good aspect as consumers .however , if the advertisements always show exact what products look like , i am not going to buy the products and watch the advertisements like cms , magazines , and posters .finally , the advertisements company can not attein a lot of money from cms , magazines , and posters .i think that usually the companys earn a great deal of money from advertising .thus , if they are not allowed to get mony from these advertisements , the company would not make better advertisesments than previous one .in addition , if many customers become not go to the stores , the stores are suffered from that .the advertisements are really effective way to sell products , and stores also take a lot of advantages .all in all , i agree with this statemant as a consumer .
