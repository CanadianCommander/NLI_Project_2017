i believe young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities and i do not agree with the statement .in this century , the number of elders are increasing continuously .by that , it became more important to maintain elders in the community .the point is that it is usually those teens and yuong people in 20 s who help old ladys on the street or go to nursing house to serve the elders .i had volunteered many time with friends to take a walk whth elders who live alone .adults are not doing these works saying that they are tired of work or they do not have much time to do so .adults are also using young people to do additional works .school teachers are a commom example of this situation .teachers order students to pull out grass and pick out small stones out of school gardens after school .i rather believe that adults are the one that does not try to help their community .i also saw many young people volunteer on their own and they were willing to do it .in korea , young people work as helpers at subway stations and mostly at the nursing house .they also go to police stations or post office to clean up the place .as universities are putting a rule on additional scores to those who volunteered for the community , more youngs now have chance than past .accordingly , more people will try to help the community .although it is not an active way , it is good to the community considering that adults are busy working and there is not much people to work for community .for the reasons and examples above , i disagree with the statement and young people put enough time to helping their communities .however , i think there needs to be more improvement to both adluts and youngs to actively help their communities .
