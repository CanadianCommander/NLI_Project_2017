i agree the following statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i really think it is more impotant to learn the ideas and the concepts more than the fact .students need a lot of idea to grow not only their bodies , but their inside such as opinions and the way they think .i am not saying that to learn fact is not important , but i think it is more important to learn ideas and concepts .i think facts come from ideas and concept .if there is no fact , there would not be any fact in my opinion .so i think students need to learn about the facts and concepts and then learn about the facts .if they learn the facts first it would be difficult to understand why it happened or why it became like that .today , the offices and the companies looks for the ideas and how creative are the people when they hire new staffs .you might learn some ideas or the way it is , but if you learn ideas it woud give you more facts and how it is .i believe that both are important but it is more important to learn about ideas and concepts today .facts might be more important to some other kinds of job , but i think most of the jobs needs more ideas and concept than facts .in the old days they might needed more facts instead of ideas and concepts , but today , it is more important to learn about ideas and concept to improve your opinion and what you believe .finally i think it is important to learn both `` ideas and concept  and `` facts.  but fact needs some ideas and ideas and concept causes facts .it means they both need each other and people needs to learn both .if you learn just either one it would not do any good , but i think students shoud learn about ideas and concept more than facts .
