firsteval , it is important to remind that , usualy , successfull people are people with habilities and knowledges in specific fields .usualy , the success does nt come alone .you succeeded because you have dared things , which means generally that you took risks .successful people usualy get money from their success , and we could think this is crazy to take other risks because you may loose the money you won .to my mind successful people are people who like risks , and who are better under pressure .as an example i will talk about my girlfriend s granfather .he is a decorator and he lost all his money and everything he made up several years ago .but while some people would nt know what to do , he restarted everything from the beginning , to find success again and that s what he did .i think most of successful people are very self confident people , and that s why they re stronger than the others , because if they fall , they can also rebuild what has been destroyed .otherwise , trying new things and taking risks while you succeeded may appear as really crazy .would nt it be better to take advantage of what you won , instead of risking to lose it ?i think the best to do , when you are a successful people , is to try new things but taking the less risks as possible ; indeed , even if you are successful one time , may be next time you wo nt and you will loose everything .but in the opposite , if you do nt take risks in your life , you may never successful or at least , you may spend a very boring life .that s why a certain dose of risk has to be taken , even if you are successful .trying new things opens up your mind , whereas going on to do only what you know how to do well does nt .
