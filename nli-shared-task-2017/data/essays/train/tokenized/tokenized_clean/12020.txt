i belelieve that the following statement is true .in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today because of the high oil prices and the new inventions discovered by technology .but i believe some inventions will keep the cars alive but with few exceptions and changes .in the early 1990 s the production of cars have recently started .since those years cars have been a production to the world wide industry and a famous traveling comfort to the world .the worst fact about the car is the liquid it needs to consume in order to run .that liquid is called petroleum which mostly many cars need to use in order to work .oil has been the primary source of energy for cars to start its engine .so many cars around the world have been produced at a high amount which equals the same amount of oil being purified and changed to petroleum for cars .mostly every car gives out a deadly gas that it dissolved into the air .this makes air pollution occur and at today stage the world is suffering from a great jeoperdy of killing the enviroment with these emissions .the oil produces a very bad gas that is released and covered in the air .mostly many trees around the area can cover it up with oxygen but with the cars being produced at a fast pace problems will occur .the enviroment is already suffering from air pollution also some countries have already suffered the air pollution and as the outcome many citizens have to go out covering their faces because they could get killed .it is proven a fact that if you stay in a room filled with the gas car produces you can get killed because of the oxygen taking up less space .the whole world is looking at it as a great problem because it affects the enviroment greatly .it is increasingly making the wold suffer greatly .i believe that the best solution to the problem is to stop the production of vehicles that produce heavily disturbed gas .mostly the older cars from the 1990 s give out worst emissions than cars today .most new companies have to create a different source of energy for cars .in the world today the production of hybrid cars have started and it is a healthy car for the enviroment .it doesnt affect the enviroment at all .also that in the end oil is about to become extinct because we are using it for almost every energy production .oil will not exisist and cars will have to run over a new energy source like hybrid .in conclusion i believe that in twenty years there are going to be less cars because of the enviromental problems it is causing and the oil becoming extinct .even though new inventions of technology is being discoverd the official car of today will be not used much .the new technology will change the cars status so it can gain benefits for both the humans and the world s enviroment .
