i personally think there would be few cars in use because of the enviroment and the climate in future .if there would be few cars , people will use train , buses and airplanes which everyone will use .by having less cars , the amount of petrols burned will decrease due to the decrease in transportation .firstly , in many television , they say that the climate , in future , will change extremely because of the pollution .for instance , there is an increase in carbon dioxide , co2 because of burned fossil fuels .in the time of industry , many factories were built that resulted as polluted the air .cars have also polluted the air because of burning petrol .in addition , there are more cars because people can use it drive anywhere they want .however , by burning petrol , this has changed the climate .nowadays , we can see that the temperature is rapidly rising than the previous years .people now think that they should decrease cars to not pollute the air .therefore , this will lead to a decrease in cars .secondly , cars are one of the reason of pollution which destroys environment .as petrol is burned , the gas that is created from burning will pollute the air that will decrease the amount of oxygen .the oxygen is one of an important substance for us , human being and for other natures .however , there is a theory that trees and other plants can dissolve carbon dioxide but nowadays there are too much carbon dioxide in the air that plants can no more dissolve them .nowadays , there are many important natural places that people are not allowed to enter because they may pollute .this is mainly because people are using cars , electricity and other things .most of the things we use in daily life are made of fossil that mainly polluted the air .it is hard for us to stop producing from fossil or use fossil because it is the main product we use , therefore , people can stop using cars from burning petrol .lastly , because of the increase in carbon dioxide and pollution , the ozone layer is now half destroyed .these days , climate is fairly warmer than previous years because of the ozone layer .ozone layer is important for the earth that protects the direct ray of light from the sun but because the ozone layer is destroyed , our summer has become warm and also in other seasons .in conclusion , in twenty years , i strongly think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of enviromental reasons .due to the change in climate and the problem of environment , people would courage to keep the air clean by taking transports instead of cars and cleaning the city .many people are scared of the climate in future and they are thinking of how to solve the problem for our generation and future generations .i would like to use cars in future but i like to use trains and buses because i may pass places where i have not been to .it may cost money to take transportation , especially in japan , but this will help for all human as financial reason and even animals for nature .
