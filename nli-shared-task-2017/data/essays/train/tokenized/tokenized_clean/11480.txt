i disagree with the statement saying `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use ,  bacuase it is unrealistic .cars are essential item for people to live with all over the world today , and it is impossible that people invent something substitute to cars .in japan , for example , people can get around only by puclic transportation only in the major cities , such as tokyo or osaka .anywhere outside of them can not function without cars which transfer goods and people from and to the place .my family does not own a car , however , this is because we live in the tokyo area where trains come every three minutes .this sotuation is expeptinal compared to other cities in the world , and people still have cars in tokyo to step out of this area .in america , the situation of public transportation is even worse .since america is such a huge country where the population is scattered , people have to drive wherever they go .it is true to almost all the major cities , such as los angeles or wahington d.c. only new yorkers can afford not to have cars .in most of the parts in the coutry , people can not even go shopping or schools without cars .i once lived in the san francisco bay area , which is known for its great public transportation represented by bart , yet i still wished to have a car in order to go out safely at night .bart does not run as late and frequesnt as subways in tokyo , therefore people need cars anyway even in the city in the states .there is no plan to expand public transportation services either .even if so , it is not realistic to accomplish it in twenty years .this provides the vision that the world remain to need as many cars as it does today .there is nothing that can cause declining of cars in number .moreover , more and more country are developing its ecomony and industry nowadays .china is a good example of a quickly developing country .when the nation develops , there will be more population and movement of people and goods , which requires the cheapest means of transportation ; cars .more developing counties will need cars for its development , and people who have never the need for environmentally conscious car technology will be in greater need in the future , however , the need for cars itself will not decline .
