while there are things that can suggest this can actually happen , i dont consider the idea of having less cars than there are today in twenty years very possible .there are various reasons why i consider this to be very hard .the first reason why i consider this not to be easily achieved is the rapid population growth we are going through .population has been increasing rapidly over the years , even though in many developed nations population rates are either staying the same or reducing , in developing nations such as india , china and many other the history is very different , population grows everyday .even though governments are trying to stop this by taking drastic measures , these will take time and by then more and more cars will be needed and produced .another reason why i consider this to be something that can hardly happen is due to the fact that developed nations have people with extreme amount of money .even though this people may need one car or two they will purchase a ridiculous amount of cars .technology is something that is advancing every day .before car companies needed a large amount of people and time to produce one car , now with the help of technology millions of cars are produced every day , in some procedures humans are not even involved .this suggests that cars are being made at a more rapid rate and many more cars are being sold everyday all around the world .as i mentioned before there are some points which are very important to these discussion .oil is so expensive now that even though many people can afford a car not all of them can afford gas , therefore this could support the idea of less cars being made .i sincerely bellieve that having less cars in 20 years is very hard but there are points which suggest the opposite , therefore i can only hope and wait to see what actually happens .
