`` there is no substitute for hardwork  this is the praise that the successful people do follow in their life .so taking these aspects into concern , i strong agree that successful people should try out for new things in their life eventually .since i agree that successful people have gained enough knowledge from the society to live through , and at the same time their experience in success would definetly useful to be put up in other aspects , which is very much essential for the people of the next generation , which would pave the paths for them to enlight them in that particular fields .these people should definetly try out for the new things by handling the risks rather than doing the things which they are familiar with , these people gain a lot of knowledge from their carrer .if they are failed once they need to try out for that untill they succeed .failures are the stepping stones of success so they need to try out for new things , that would give another sought of experience which will be very encouraging for these people .so what ever may be the project you are going to take take that project as avery worthful for you then you can be succeeded .if the person is experienced in all the aspects of life then he can come out with flying colours .so i would conclude by saying that successful people should try out new things rather than handling the things which he already known to him .`` be dare take risks nothing can substitute experience
