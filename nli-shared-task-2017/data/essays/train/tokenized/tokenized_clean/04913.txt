since i am attending the final year of secondary school in germany right now i am about to choose my major for college .there are many things that i am very interested in .i like politics and economy .but i would also like to study history or law and i absolutely love to learn languages .now , i could decide to study only one of the subjects i mentioned above .but since it is more important and more interesting to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be an expert in one subject i choose to enroll in the major called international relations .it is a combination of all the subjects i mentioned above .firstly , i strongly believe that one should follow as many of one s interests as possible .the human mind is able to connect different subject areas which , combined with broad knowledge , results in a better ability to understand complex concepts of the world .additionally it is always hard to sacrifice one passion for another .secondly , there s a different approach : what if you suddenly loose interest in what you are doing at your job ?is nt it wise to have access to a `` second door  ?this way there s a much better chance of finding a different job which will still provide you with enough income to feed your family .or suppose you loose your job ?if you have a broader education there s much more jobs that you can apply for .it makes it easier to find a new job .thirdly , studying many subjects at once is more interesting than just one .this way you do something different every day .even if it might be more challenging to concentrate on so many things at once , it will be much more fun .it makes it possible to combine you re knowledge from the different areas .what is more , every subject shows you a different view on the world .
