since i was a child i thought that car was the most important way to transport in the world .now i think that there are too much car on the street in the most of industrialized country .big number of car in europe , usa , japan . ..is the most human problem in twentyone centuries .more people thinks that in future we will drive future cars with hydrogen alimentation , because this elements can not produce any pollution .but i do nt think so .i m a student of engineering logistic and transport and i know what i saying .big study about this hydrogen cars shew how hidrogen alimentation is more expensive than oil or natural gas alimentation .i m so disagree with the phrase that i can read on my left .in twenty years i think will be more cars than there are today .i m so sure of that because there are much statistics that shew that salary people will grow up , so they can buy a car easier .i think also that anyone likes travel in comfortable way .about this i can say for myself experience that it s so bettre travel by own car than trains for example . ..if you have a trip with your car you do nt have any time to respect and you feel more free and indipendent than any others way to move .finally i think that this affermation wo nt true , but i think cars pollution is a great problem in our society .
