well , my openion about this subject is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .and its not just about time that they dont have , its that they dont have the `` will  , as they say `` if there is a `` will  there is a `` must   .nowadays young people that are between 15-25 their minds are only settled on playing as a major idea , then studying as a second , and ofcourse beign a center of attraction in any king of subject .in soccer for example , at our school student especially ages between 15 and 18 , they do their best just to achive there goal of eighther being the centre of attraction , or that he hates the other team or a player in the other team .and some student like to be the `` the fashion boy  , that he wears every new brand that has come down , eigther its nice or bad , `` its fashion  , also as old men the say `` tailors do not make men  .well lets say 10 % of these young people alittle bit of time to help their communities by working hard and studying in order to achive a goal .to put a goal in your life , in the future of your own , your your family , is the main idea of life .putting a goal in your life will lead you to the best , and whatever right you do , you will have confidence in your self , and what you do now will reflect the life of your family ( kids and wife ) , as my father always say : the more you do , the more you get .well ill talk about my self and goals in that limited life in just a few words , my goal im this life is to be the best architect in the world ( well thats what i say , atleast in town ) , and thats my last year in school , and im trying my best to get hight marks inorder to go to the university that i want , and have a nice and happy life .
