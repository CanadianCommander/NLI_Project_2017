the issue if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than fot them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society .in my opinion the students knowledge is improved when thaey undestand not only the facts but the underlying ideas and concepts .in this essay i will support my answer with specific reasons and examples .facts are definetly the students knowledge base .before any consideration the students need to know what happend .so teachers need to explain the fact without any comment or personal opinion .in a second moment facts are trasposed into ideas and concepts .teachers should help students to understand what drove the fact and what conseguence it had .in our society is really important not only to know what happen but also undestand the ideas and motivation .a great example is 11/09 .everybody see what happend on the twin towers .the real knowledge come from the undestanding of the nature and the couse of the terroristic attack .only in this way students can go deply in the problem and try to find a solution .in conclussion iam completely agree that students should analyse problems leaning the fact and undertand ideas and concepts that are behind the fact .only in this way students will be able to find correct solutions to the problems that they will occur into .
