in general i support the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know .to support this statement you first have to look at the reasons why people become successful in the first place .you also have to have a look at the word successful and to evaluate its definition .successful people - usually we are thinking of people who are successful in more than one aspect of life , e.g. work , family , sports . ..we consider them to be above average .but what do you have to do to become above average ?it requires you to go a step further when other people stop , or to use ways and means that nobody has used before you .a successful scientist , for example , has to abandon worn out paths and try something new , look in a direction that noone has looked before or exploit a field that has been considered as irrelevant .by this he moves himself on a brink , because leaving the standard routes always implies the possibility of failure .a manager who has the reputation for being able to fix unsuccessful enterprises had to do the unusual to stand out of the row of managers before him , who all but failed .however , to reach true excellency you have to take risks and do something new - otherwise you will remain average .additionally , if you are already successul you have the monetary or social background that you can risk something without gambling with your bare existence .if you hardly have enough money to feed your family you will be less likely to do anything that might harm you in a way that you wo nt be able to support them anymore .on the other hand , if you have sufficient resources at hand you can afford adventures and failures , as they might onlyu set you back a bit but not deprive you of your way of living .having said this , it is easy to infer why successful people tend to be riskier or otherwise exceptionnel : they had to have these strains in their character to become successful at all and they have less consequences to fear .their ability to cope with failure and their exploratory sense make them more affected to being truly unusual .
