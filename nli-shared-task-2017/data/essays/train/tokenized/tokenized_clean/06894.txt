learning methods , nowadays , are different .students are more able to understand ideas and concepts as they have more supports , for instance books , and the `` new  one , internet . ..however , for a student the purpose of the course is not always clear .in this way , he can understand more precisely a concept or an idea by using the supports and therefore by increasing his knowledge by his own .in my opinion , a student will be more interested in a subject in which he knows the basis rather than in a subject that he will only know the facts .understanding subjects will be clearer and easier for him to discuss , to argue for and to interpret .he will be self-confident on what he talks about and will be able to respond to question , as the subject will be appear more sustainable for him .learning facts is not easy for children .it may seems to be a succession of important things to know but without meaning for the children .the student must be lost and confused on the subject as he will not understand from where information come from .moreover , if a student understand ideas and concepts he will be more able to take in mind those things for a long time and will be able to use it in the future , whereas , if he only understand facts , the subject must stay in mind for a short term period .to conclude , from my point of view , learning facts is the basis of confused knowledge , whereas understanding ideas and concepts is the starting point of a intellectual culture .
