i disagree with the statement .i think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .the new technology has been developted and will be in very high speed and in very varied way that people use the cars more in their life .the cars does nt mean not only tools of movement for people any longer but their important partners .you may have used the cars for commuting your office in every weekday or going out to visit the new places with your family or going to shopping with your friends .and the techology showed the answers to our nees in many scene of them .and now you have some benefit of the new techology , for example , the navigation system shows the situationof traffic jam or short cut on your way to work .you are not afraid of the new roard which you never have visited before because you can have more information or the right place where you want to arrive at .you may do nt have to open the door of your key when you re bring many stuffs from your shopping if you have an intellegent key ( called `` keyless entry  ) .people can feel the convenience with cars more and that will a essential part of our lives .sometimes we have heard the negative aspects of cars .for example , car accidents or the influence on the environment .i think the new techonoly can also slove some of the problems , the automatic driving system or the sense that can find out the distance between the cars or internal camera on the cars can help reducing the rates of accidents in the future .and the study about hybrid cars or new furuel must be more increased in many countries with their own nature resources .in twenty years , people use the cars more in their life in more safely and convenietely
