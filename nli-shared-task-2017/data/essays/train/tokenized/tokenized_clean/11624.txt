many companies spend a lot of money for their advertisements .because advertisements are closest us who buy many kind of products .but i think advertisements are sometime too much and too attract for us .because they ca nt give real visual and texture for us .i agree with the following statement .fist of all , we can see a nice product advertisement , but it s not real , and real color .in my experience , i got a wrong color dress which i did nt expected after i ordered a brillilante dress on the internet .i was sure the dress color , because i cheked it many times .but i got not my favare .i was so shocked .but it was my fail .because they said sometime color is different your expect on the screen !second , when i saw a tv shopping , they sell a confortable sofe .on the tv , a couple were sitting comfortable , and reding books .it was a my drem sofe .and i bought it and i cried .because the sofe was uncomfortable and unfit for me .in my opinion , we shold nt belive any advertisements .many companies spend a lot of money and attract us a lot .but we ca nt see real and touch , smell , and feel .we should buy a product after you know really one .
