i personally agree with the topic that nowadays young people donot give enough time to helping their community .students in the present day modernised world are attracted to more of things like discos and pubs rather than social activities .to make my opinion stronger i would like to take a personel experience .on the eve of the independence day some of our college friends decided to do some thing good on that day .as a part of it we decide to constuct a compound wall for a tribal school .we sent requests to different colleges in need of volunteers .but on that we were shocked to see that vrey few people turned out for that event .one more reason why stuudents cant make to such events is that the world has become so competetive that students dont even get time to relax for one complete day .for example my friends who are persueing thier graduate courses also aim for other exams like cat , sat etc .also they need to maintain their grades in thier regular graduetion course .so its difficult for them to spend some time for the extracurricular activities .thus howmuch interest they have its not possible for students like them .finally the advent of internet in the 20th century revolutionised things very much .it has made world into a global village .anyone can access anything in this world by just sitting at their homes .this made young people from moving out of their places .thus making them lazy .hence seldom young people spare enough time to helping thier communities .thus from my personal experience i think that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping thier communities .
