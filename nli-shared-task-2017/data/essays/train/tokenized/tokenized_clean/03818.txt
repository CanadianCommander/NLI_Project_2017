nowadays everybody talks about environment , ecology , nature , ...this refection blames that our society do nt take care about the earth .the question about the cars is recurent .and the associeted question is `` how reduce the pollution  .so we can ask if they are fewer cars in twenty years than today .on the one hand , twenty years is a court period today .in fact we are in the technologic developpement period which always rise .but it is not say that ingeniors or researchers find answer at theirs questions .automobils  ingeniors develop today news motors , conception , design , they try to develop new range , in oder to repond to demand .more they try to give an accesse to their cars to everybody .despite the governemt try to imply everybody in the ecology battle , the fact is the automobil area is a business and they ca nt reduce it .on the other hand , cars are a really pleasure for somebody .the pleasure to drive , to go where they want , to be independant , to do what you want when you want .today we accused the price of oil but everybody always take theirs cars and do nt stop to use it .moreover today we can see the development of new oil , biological oil so ecology repected .finally , there is the city , the big city , where everybody is always worried by the traffic in .on theirs city the cars  number will be reducing in the twenty years comming .in conclusion and to my mind , the cars  number will not reduce in the twenty years because all the points i developped , but the reduction will be possible only on cities where they will develop othe tranport system .i like to drive , such as take sometime train or fly , but car is the independance , and i think you ca nt take it at anybody .
