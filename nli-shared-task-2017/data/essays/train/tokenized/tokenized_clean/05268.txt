we are living where has the plenty of advertisement .we see any kind of ads everyday , even if we would nt want to .and most of them make themselves look better .it heppens all the time .i sometimes believed the advertisements and i bought several items .whenever i trusted them , they brought me down .i saw advertising heater which was advertising on tv .i thought that looked so good .and i bought it .but that was not my expection .that was not smae color .turely , the shape was not same at all .the advertisement told me that was not breaking at all but i used third time it was borken .i was really angry at that time .other product wre mostly alike .after that i saw an ad of hair dryer .the ads , it made my hair be like to silk and was not hurt my hair at all .but that did nt make a sence .how did the hair dryer make your hair be silk ?i could nt believe the ads at all .i thought that people who made the ads did nt have any conscious .when i went shopping , i showed a sign on the window .it said the sale ` buy one get one free for all items .and i chosed two of hand rotions .when i tried to check out , the saler said .the products i chosed did nt include the slaes product .i wasbunch of advertisements attract people to buy them .but most of them that is not a true .so , people should check between ads and real product and make sure it is ok .and we must not buy a product which has a difference between ads and products .
