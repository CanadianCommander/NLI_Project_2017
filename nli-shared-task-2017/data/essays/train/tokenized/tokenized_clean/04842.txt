regarding the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  i think it depends on the situation and the country or place where you are going .traveling deals with a lot of things like : language , culture , nature , weather , kind of inhabitants , available time , etc. and for every case it coulbe a different oppinion about the statement .for instance if i m in china probably i will prefer to be guided by a skilled tour guide , otherwise anybody can get lost , but if i m going to an european country in that case i will prefer to go on my own .time is also important if you have little time for traveling then an experienced guide will be very heplfull to know as much as possible in short time .regarding groups , if you are with a group where you do nt know anybody it will be very different experience if you know all of the people in the group very well , like in a football team or schoolmates .on the other hand , if your intention is to know new people in the place you are visiting , then traveling alone it could be an advantage .other important factor to consider is the reason or the final intention of the travel .for instance , if you are traveling to rest and be away of noise , to have a time for yourself or , on the contrary , you are willing to know new places , people and cities .in both cases , the group or the guide is a big difference .as explained , it is necessary to take a lot of things into account before to agree or disagree with such general statement , but if i have the oppotunity to travel , i will prefer to go to europe in a group and without tour guide , in this case i do nt agree with the statement .
