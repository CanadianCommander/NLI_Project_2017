there has been many controversies going on regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i strongly believe that a person should have broad knowledge of various academic subjects rather than specialized knowledge .first of all , having broad knowledge allows an individual to become `` better  than a person who specialized in one specific subject .what i mean by better is that the person will have more opportunity to get a good job and have a better life , because after all , what a company and the society look for in a person is how round an individual is .the broader a person s knowledge is , the more an individual is considered rounded .for example , my father who is a ceo of his own company once said that a company looks for a person who is rounded rather than a perosn who is good in one specific area .when he chooses new workers for his company , he always sees if a person has broad knowledge or not .his rationale behind this is that if a person is more rounded , then the individual will be able to work in many different areas , which brings up the efficiency of the company as a whole .not only that , but a rounded person is usually more experienced with various things .rounded person has vast knowledge which reflects that the individual must have had experienced many aspects of life .however , if a person is specialized in one detailed subject , then it reflects that a person has narrow mind and is less experienced than the rounded person is .for example , a friend of mine who has broad knowledge is more familiar with all the different kinds of events happening .however , another friend of mine who is specialized in one speicific subject is narrow minded and unfamiliar with subjects that he did not specialize .thus , the extent of the knowledge portray s a person s experience in life .lastly , a person who has broad knowledge is more opened minded than the specialized person is .a good example is my mother who has endless knowledge about everything .everytime i talk to her , i realize that she is very liberal and is open minded .however , my father who specialized in chinese culture in university , has a very conservative and closed mind about all the events because he simply does not have broad experiences .i personally think being opened and liberal is crucial in current society , because the new generations of people are generally welcoming changes and are opened as well , and in these days it is important to fit in the society in order to survive .to summarize , i advocate the point that a person should have broad knowledge of many different academic subjects .a korean proverb states `` digging one well is hard , but digging many different well with same depth as that of digging one well is harder ,  which means , an individual should challenge oneself by digging various wells , also meaning that a person should have broadd knowledge of many different subjects .
