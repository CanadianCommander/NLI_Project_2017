i agree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks are more successful than people who just stay on the level they are already on .in my opinion people who want to be successful should be creative and open for new things .furthermore they should believe in themselves and should not get insecure , if other persons do not agree with their opinion or way of proceeding .for instance , many big inventions such as cars or planes would nt exist this time , if there would not have been somebody who was affected to new things , had the will to research and to take the risk of failing .probably , when daimler invented the first car most people thought he would be crazy and did not support his plans .he had the risk to fail , but as we can see today it turned out as a big invention and he became famous .however , if people would nt be risky and open-minded the human nature would nt be on this level it is right now .the society needs people who are interested in new things to develop and to grow up .if we all would stay on the level which we are good in and do not increase our abilities , we still would live in wooden houses as centuries ago .
