the humankind always need knowledge to reach good life standarts .everyone has different aspects of this idea .some assume that it is more iportant for students to understand ideas and concepts , in contrary to this some assume that it is important for them to learn facts .i totally agree with second idea .these are my following reasons .firstly , the reason the knowledge from learning facts is important is permanent .when people learn facts with experience , they do not forget easily .so they use these facts through all their life .for example , i had an car accident last year .before this event , my parent advised to not drive fast .i understood the ideas , however it did not help me avoid to make accident .now , after accident i learn my lesson and drive my car slowly .in addition to this , the reason that the learning facts is more important rather than understanding the concepts is to show an example of it in real life .the understanding the concepts can be so abstract .for example , the concept of communism seems like so perfect , however in the real life this concept can not be worked well .so students can be confused by this abstract concept .as i mentioned above the learning facts is more important for students than understanding ideas and concepts according to these reasons : it is both permanent and real .i think the teaching system should modify with these reasons .
