i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .my argument is clearly supported by the following reasons and examples .to illustrate the point , we first want to know the purpose of the advertisement .why are the manufacturers spending so much money on advertisements .the anwer is quite simple to everybody .they want to make money out of the products .that determines that most advertisements exaggerate the advantages of the products , and rarely mentioned the downsides .and the disadvantages are usully played down if they are mentioned at all .for example , toyota claims that the prius , the most famous brand of hybrid cars , can run 42 miles per gallon of gas .however , that s not true , at least for most of situations .the typical mileage of prius is only around 35 , a quite gap from the toyota s claim .in fact , you can get mileages close to 42 when you drive on the highway only .obviously , the advertisement put out by toyota handily never mention that .there is another example .proactive , the famed medication for treating acny , states in the advertiesment , that it works very well on different types of skins , no matter dry , sensitive , very moisture .it turns out that it is not true either .it only works fairly well on dry skill .it does nt work on the sensitive skin at all .in turn , it could make the situation worse .the nature of an advertisement is essentially determined by its mission , marketing the product for its producer .thus i strongly believe that all advertisements are doing exaggerations , more or less .since almost all risks generated by using the products are on consumers , therefore , consumers should do their own researches when puchasing products , especially for higly valued goods or important products for health .
