whenever people is planning to travel and visit places , they make sure to include a tour guide in their visit , because they believe it is the best way to travel .they see in it many advantages , especially on the knowledge the tour guide possesses of the place in question , knowledge that would definitely enrich the traveling experience .as a matter of fact , the knowledge a tour guide has on a specific site constitutes a very important key in the discovery of the place itself .let s say , for example , that summer is right next door , and a much expected and anticipated trip to copan ruins at last has come .a tour guide will take tourists to the most important parts of the ancient mayan site , and in detail will explain to the group the historic events , be it social , economic or intellectual , that led to the specific scenery the tourists are observing .this knowledge , especially if the tour guide is native to the place , will help the tourists immerse in the culture and the history of copan ruins .on the other hand , having a tour guide of copan ruins will in some ways make the group see things as the tour guide sees them ; also , the trip will be narrowed to what the tour guide or the agency he works for , decides to include , leaving out ineresting facts that just ca nt be included due to lack of time .i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , only if , after the tour i get the time to wander by myself around the place , let s say copan ruins , and see things through my own eyes and personal experiences ; only if i m able to bring to my mind the things i previously read about this ancient place and draw my own conclusions based on what i ve read and seen ; only if i get a moment on my own to feel the magic of the place and to be a part of it .if a trip lacks this essential part , then it is incomplete , even if we get an experienced tour guide that knows historic facts like the palm of his hand .
