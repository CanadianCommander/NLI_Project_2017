some people believe that successful people shoud try new things and take risks .others believe that successful people shoud only do what they already know how to do well .however , i believe that people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks .i have two convincing reasons .they can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well .first , we can save time .if people want to try new things , they have to do error and trial to establish new things .it takes time to establish new things .if i want to establish new physics theory , i have to spend a lot of time to think about the theory , probably i have to spend my whole life .in contrast , if they only do what they know how to do well , they do not need to spend so much time .in the case of physics , they just need to remember physical laws which alreadly known .thus , we can save time by doing what they already know how to do well .second , we can save money .if people want to try new tnings , they have to take risks .often they lose money because they fail to try new things .many people want to have their own company .however , they do not because they want to avoid risks .for example , if i have enough knowledge about car technology and want to have new company to make cars , i have to invest enormous money .in addition , i have to compete other car companies like gm , ford and toyota which have far more money than i. thus , my car company will bunkrupt easily .then i will lost money .therefore , if people want to success , they should do what they already know how to do well .they can not expect to earn more money than they expect , but they can earn money as they expect .in conclusion , i believe that people should only do what they are alreay know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks .i have two convincing reasons .they can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well .
