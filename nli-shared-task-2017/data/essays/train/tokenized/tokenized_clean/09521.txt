`` the world will change  this was what our teacher told us one day .for my part , i think there will be fewer care in the twenty years than there are today for many reasons .first i think that the sources of energy will decrease , especially oil .so it will be hard to provide oil to cars .now the oil price is over 70 $ !unless if they discover new sources of energy .in addition to prices of oil will get higher and higher .people will have problems in getting gas for their cars .second thing , population of the world will increase .so it will be hard to drive because of traffic , and it will a take long time to move from one place to another .as most studies stated , and as many people immigrating from poor countries to the developed ones .third , discovering new means of transportation such as subways , or express trians will be a good reason that people will leave cars .because they are cheper , faster , and safer .also , maybe there will be new `` generation  of means of transportations as rockets .who knows ?forth , because of globaliztaion , i think , the prices in generall is increasing .the prices of food or housing for example is getting higher and higher every day and the salaries is getting lower .as a result of that , people will not be able to buy cars , or even to provide the things that cars need like oil or spear partsi think the number of people using cars will be less than today .but i hope that we will find new ways to move from one palce to another in a safe way that will no
