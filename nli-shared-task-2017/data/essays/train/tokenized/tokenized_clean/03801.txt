advertisement definitely helps to make products more attractive , even if their actual value does not correspond to the promises made by the advertisement .it is not very surprising that this is the case .there is a whole industry dealing only with the task of promoting products .they employ experts who use the latest psychological knowlegde of how to influence the human perception of a certain product .of course a product will become more appealing if it is developed exactely for the target group you belong to .the advertisement not only tries to sell a product , it tries to sell a lifestyle .it says , if you drive this car , drink this beer , smoke these cigarettes , you will have a pleasant life , a successful career and more sex than you ever could have dreamt of .that makes a product look very attractive on a tv screen .after having bought the article , it often turns out that it does not fulfill all desires that were promised to be fulfilled .in reality , it looks much less impressive than on the screen and the consumer in fact is rather disappointed .another example for advertised products with low quality is fast food , either in a restaurant or from the supermarket .the advertisement suggests that eating this particular pizza or hamburger is not only tasteful , but also very nourishing .the tv spot may show a happy family gathered around a table , eating these great five minute noodles .the advertisement wants to imply that this is a healthy meal for the wholw family .instead , the product is really poorly nourishing and does not keep the promis .taken everything mentioned above into consideration
