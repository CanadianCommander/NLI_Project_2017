in my opinion it is not simply to say , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i think it has to be analysed by different views .clear , in general the students should understand the ideas and concepts .because if they would not understand the ideas and the concepts , it s to expect that they wo nt be able to practizise the thinks , they should have learned .when the students get into the job , they have to reproduce what they learned in the university or school .and if they only know something about facts , they can not be very successful in what they do .every student should wanting to be successful in his job or in whatever he does .if they do not care about what they do , they normally can not expect a life , what other students could have , cause the did a little bit more .so i think , that it is the better way for all students to understand more then only the facts of an individual topic .but there is another point of view .during the time of school or university , there are often time - periods of tests .some universities have test - periods , where the students are forced to wright ten tests a week .in that case , it is not possible for every student to understand all ideas and concepts .it is necessary for the student to finish all test in the best way it is even possible .therefore , it could be a better choice to learn all facts , that you are able to finish all tests .i think this is a typical problem for students , studying in the first semesters .afterwords , during the main semesters , the students have found their special themes , they want to work on .in that case , it is much easier for them to learn more about the ideas and concepts .in the main period of studium , it is much more important to understand the ideas and the concepts .so again , to understand the ideas should be the task for every student but it is to accept , that there could be moments , where it is better to use the facts , to get a better result .
