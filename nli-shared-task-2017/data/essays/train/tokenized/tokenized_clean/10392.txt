in the last years the number of the families that have more than one car is increased a lot .nonetheless i think that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use .there are a lot of reasons to explain this thing firstly now we have too many cars per family , in fact every family has 2 or , sometimes , 3 cars .in fact you need a lot of money to use your car every day .the reason is that the petrol is nearly to finish and its cost is becoming higher every day .secondly there is a very big problem about using cars : the pollution .in fact we are destroing our planet with the smog and if we want to save green areas we have to respect nature and animals .for instance many countryes are trying to say that we have to walk sometimes and to use bycicles and pubblic transports .however i think that , now , we are to lazy and that we do nt want to find another manner to go to work or to travel .nonetheless i think that in a few years we will be obligated to change our manner to travel and that we will understand the importance of the natural environment .for example i am 24 but i do nt have a care and i do nt care about it bacause i like to walk and to use buses a
