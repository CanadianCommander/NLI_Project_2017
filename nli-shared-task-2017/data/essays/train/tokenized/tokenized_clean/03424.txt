i am agree with the statement that sucessful people try new things and take a risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because if you do not do mistakes you will never learn .people should try and learn new things even if they do not like to do it .some people do not like to do something strange at least in their eyes because they do not have any experience about it .otherwise , how they could write and read if they do not try .everything will become hard and impossible if you do not try several times to get it correctly .my experience with that when i was in high school , i was so outsider and i do not want to lear a new things especially learing kind of sports as an example .when i decide to play tinnes , i failed several times in that time and then i gave up .after i graduated from high school i became a nimble when i play this sport before it was my boring sport .then , i tought people in the club how to play this sports .learning a new things let people avoid their previous mistakes that they had already did in the past .when people attempt to do a new things , it will be hard and boring at the first time but it is not impossible .albeit , human discovered lots of thing like space , ice ages , and they also make lots of industrial things like cars , machines , and ...etc and became popular because of that , so , why not you .keep something in the mind that lots of experements that the scientiests did , they already had mistakes with it but they tried it again and again .eventully , they got accuret because they did not gave up or they said it is difficult .people should pay attention to what is going on around them in this world .lots of famous people did mistakes but they are successful .they are successful because they made a mistake and they also learned from the mistake .when i was in high school , i did not get a good grade .so , i was so sad because i could not be successful man in my school .then , i decided to learned from my mistakes and correct them in the next semester of school .
