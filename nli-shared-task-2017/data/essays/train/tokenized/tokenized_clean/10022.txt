nowadays , quite a few students pay attention to understand ideas and concepts in the subjects .other students , however focus on the facts .as far as i am concerned , i believed that it is more important and necessary for students to understand and master ideas and concepts that they learned .among those countless factors , there are three conspicuous aspects as follows .the main reason that students should understand ideas and concepts is that ideas and concepts are the basic for the subjects .only do students master the ideas and concepts , they could completely understand the facts .for a example , when we understand the newton law , we could explain many facts that occur around us .we know why the water would drop down and apples would fall to the ground when they are in ripe .another reason can be seen that student could learn and study deeply after they get to know the ideas and concepts .students might learn more knowledges by themselves concerning to the subject .because they grasp essential ideas and concepts .it is important for students that they could learn more knowledge and explain the reason that might difficult to understand from the surface .furthermore , some facts are temporary and not forever .without understand the ideas and concepts , it is really difficult to know the truth .such as acid rain , which is partially caused by increasing industries .since we know the truth of the acid rain , people could try to control and eliminate the waste gas given from the manufactories .in conclusion , although some facts are easy to learn , it is not solution to learn the knowledge .when students understand the ideas and concepts , they not only could master the truth of the knowledge , but also help them to gain more ability to learn deeply .in addition , after students understand the ideas and concepts , they might know how to take action to resolve the problems .
