i know lots of older people enjoy life after retired their job or grew up their children because they can have time and money that young people have , so they can do anything they want .however , i agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are several reasons .first of all , young people are helthy because they are young , so they can be active and cheerful than older people .helthy is very important to do anything .it is easy to get sick or illness for older people that young people .for example , my uncle who had his own bussiness got illness after retired his job .when he was young he had lots of hobbies and he was enjoying his life .eeven though he was busy , he did make time to have fun because he was helthy and very active person .however , since he got sick , it was hard time to live , even though he had lots of money and time .secondly , young people can have dream more that older people because they can have time to live .older people feel limited to live , but young people never think about their death because they think it would not happen soon .it gives young people lots of dreams .when people have a dream , they can enjoy the time to acheane it .therefore , for these reasons i agree young people enjoy life more than older perople do .
