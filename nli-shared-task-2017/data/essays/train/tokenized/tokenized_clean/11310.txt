over the years , use of cars has increased to an enormous extent .it is really not difficult to find roads jam packed with cars .it would be interesting to predict the usage of cars in future when the number of people requiring them would have increased tremendously .in my opinion , the number should definitely go up .twenty years from now , world population would have increased by atleast 15-20 percent of what it is today .the number of car users would also increase accordingly .it would thus be expected that the number of cars also increase proportionately .however , there might be certain counter arguments challenging this simple hypothesis .one would suggest that the advancement in aviation in coming future would promote use of air transport at the day to day level and would be used for moving around even for very short distances .this would tend to decrease the usage of cars to a great extent as a lot of space ( in terms of volume ) is really unexploited in this regard .i believe that the advancement in aviation would not counter the difficulties in air traffic management that would eventually come up and so , air vehicles as move around mode of transport , are far fetched for twenty years from now .however , this might be a healthier argument for say fifty years in future when systems for air traffic management could be devised .another contradictory opinion would be forced decrease in car usage as the traffic and capacity to accomodate cars is nearing its threshold world over .i feel that ways would be devised to counteract this problem and some of them could be flooding cities with flyovers and subways ( city administrations  initiative ) or making smaller and more compact cars ( car manufacturers  initiative ) .another line of thought would be to suggest decrease in car usage as a consequence of increasing pollution level .this can be either forced by laws or as an outcome of conscious awareness of the problem among the users themselves .i feel that technological advancements would make it possible to have cars operated by energy sources other than the conventional petroleum products , e.g. , cars operated by solar batteries , wind energies and so on some of which are currently at the experiemental level .thus , it seems highly probably that twenty years down the line , number of cars used would be even greater than what they are today .
