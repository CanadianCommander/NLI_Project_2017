why , you may wonder , should we purchase items according to advertisements ?when facing this decision whether or not to believe an advertisement , somebody will claims that they trust these things , but others , in constrast , will believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than their practical situations .from my point of view , i d like to choose the second one and my arguments are listed as follows .first of all , an important reason why i hold confidence on this view is that the advertisements always states how well their products are .they may claim that they company has a strong background and what they produce may have some perfect effects .however can you believe that there is something perfert in the world ?usually , their words are not true .for example , there is a famous company , odian company in china , which is focusing on the production of modern floors .in its advertisement , it claims that its commander center is located in germany , but this have been disapproved by a newpaper .therefore , how can we believe the advertisement like that ?furthermore , another reason for my inclination for my view is that we can not find the beautiful characteritics stated in advertisements .that is to say ; when we buy one item and begin to use it , we may find that these `` splendid  characteristics disappers and some new problems arise .from a practical point of view , the advertisements will always blow up in order to make money .for instance , one of my classmates has ever brought an air condition .according the statement of the advertisement , it will not produce much noice .however , his practical experience proved that it is not easy to fall sleeping if this machine is turned on .of course , an advertisement can tell us something useful .for a new product , a good advertisement can help the customers to learn some detailed things about it and spread its impacts in the society .specially , to some extent , i ll agree that the statements in a couple of advertisement may be consistent with the real features .however , if all the aspects are contemplated , it seems advisable for us to believe that most advertisements will blow up .in a word , although advertisements can supply some useful information , most of them are blowing up in order to make profits .what they claim just try to tell something unture to make their products more attactive .from all the above arguments , we can reach the conclusion , that most advertisement will blow up in their introduction .
