i agree with the statement completely .these days , there are various kinds of advertisements in the world .it is truth that those advertisements make a product seem the best one in the world .there could be sveral methods of advertising the product , such as using beutiful models and using the time pressure .first of all , in america , there are a tons of advertisement on television .i think amerians are used to watching those advertisement without any opinions ; in other word , even though the product which are showing on tv looks good for them , people who are whatching it do not believe easily .however , i had experiance about that .when i came to amerian .every advertisements were very attrative in my mind , when i saw one scean for advertising pants with a wonderful model , i really wanted to have the pants becuase i thought i would looked like the model when i worn the pants .however , my thought was completely wrong .when i tried on it , it looked like much fatter than wering the other pants .through this experience , i realized that most advertisements exagerate their products with particular objects .in addition , most advertisements show for very short time on tv .short time make people not think carefully ; in other word , when we watch the advertisement , we have to quickly judge whether the product is appropriate or not .it also easy to misunderstand about the product , so we could remember the product would be much better than they really are .although most advertisements exagerate their products , it is difficult to avoid the situation .i think we have to know how to distinguish between the true and worng aspects when we buy some products by advertisements .
