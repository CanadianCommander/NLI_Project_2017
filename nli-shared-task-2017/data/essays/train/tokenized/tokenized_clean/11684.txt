the beginning of the 21rst century is highly marked by environmental consideration .the problem of pollution is more and more considered as a burning issue that must be tackled quickly to prevent some irreversible damages .that explains why many countries now adopt policies to decrease the number of cars .could we however imagine that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ?on the one hand , we have seen recently that many efforts are made to banish cars .we can quote the example of london whose mayor ken livingston created a system of expansive toll at the enter of downtown to deter people from using their cars .many other cities such as paris hesitate to adopt these drastic kinds of decision or to develop carpooling .moreover , the decreasing of oil ressources and the problems of instability in the countries that produce this oil trigger a huge increase of the price of gasoline and we can easily imagine that only rich people could afford having a car if this trends still remains .last but not least , the warming of the earth due to pollution and more particularly gas emissions has compelled governments to react with important agreements such as the kyoto summit which has finally been accepted by california .the example of this state is quite relevant because it produces lots of pollution with big cities such as los angeles .however , the governor has recently decided to sue the car companies that are accuded of being responsible for the pollution .even the people seem to be aware of the problem and try by themselves to lreduce their number of cars and to restrain the use of them .so , we can imagine that the number of cars will decrease in the next years .but on the other hand , twenty years is a too short period to change the mentalities and the habits .in los angeles and many other big cities , you are compelled to use cars because the net of public transportation is not enough developped .in addition , banishing cars would implie using more other means of transportation like trains or planes which are not always cheap and convenient .maybe , we could imagine that scientists will invent a new means of transportation that will use renewable energy but it is hardly possible that it would be developped in the next twenty yeras .finally , the amazing growth of china and india will create a new demand for cars that will probably compensate the positive effects of the reduction of cars in developped countries .as a conclusion , i am deeply convinced that the number of cars will not decrease in the whole world in the next twenty years .indeed , this evolution is of course necessary but requires more time to find a new valid solution and to change people mentalities .
