i disagree .in an academic subject you have to specialize in one spesific subject .in an academic career you have to improve yourself in one topic .your knowledge have to be more specialized than ordinary people .honestly broad knowledge is an asset for an academic career but it is not enough .in academic subjects you have to your own thesis , hypothesis , researchs and also stastistical results on your subject to promote .academicians are the people who leads to the society .by their opinions and knowledge our life become more qualified .for that reason they have to be specialized in one spesific subject .university life and enviroment has to supply them all the equipments they need to specialize .broad knowledge in many academic subjects , supports to discuss and create new things but not enough .all over the world assistants and professeurs are remembered by their research reports and thesis , they have to work hard and help each other by sharing their researchs .to find out something we have to focus on a spesific subject like einstein , archimedes .
