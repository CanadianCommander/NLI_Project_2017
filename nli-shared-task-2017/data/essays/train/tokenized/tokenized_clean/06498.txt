i think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion it happens particularly during spots on television : in fact each of us can remember that he brought something because it was introduced very well , or because the spot was really nice or interesting .it happens because the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of us has a tv and watches it every day .all the reasons that cause this phenomenum concerne business , in fact industries use spots to convince people that their products are very useful and they always insist about the good quality of them .in my opinion sometimes producers lie because they want to be richer and richer , but sometimes they lie because they live in a critical economic period , even if i do nt want to justify them .in fact we must consider that in the period of globalisation a lot of products have generated a real invasion of market all over the world , and it is very difficult for industries to defend their products because the competition with other products is hard .about this aspect we can remember the most important new element of global economic , that is represented by the chinese market .this market through its low prices causes a real crisis of modern economy and forces a lot of european or american industries to be more competitive .as a result a lot of this industries try to send their products by doing false advertisements about their qualities .i think it is completely wrong because the customers always want to buy faithful products , characterised by a real good quality ; so if they are not satisfied by things they buy , they will change products immediately , particularly in the period of globalisation , during which you can find a big variety of products .
