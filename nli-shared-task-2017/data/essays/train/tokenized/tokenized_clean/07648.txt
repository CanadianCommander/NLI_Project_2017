going by the spiralling rates of fuel prices , there definitely would be fewer cars in use twenty years from now , than there are today .when , i say cars , i mean vehicles running on petroleum products and not the alternative fuels like solid fuel , solar cells and other alternatives .some twenty years ago , owning a car was a middle class dream , but today it s a nightmare , because of the steep price that one has to shell out to keep the engine running .buying a car is easier today with greater competition in the auto industry leading to affordable prices but alas , no such competition exists in the fuel industry and prices are going only one way .installment schemes can lure people to buy their fancied machine but how long they can keep it on the road is a tougher question to answer .and then when there are the alternatemethods of travelling that are available today , they make atleast day to day travelling much easier .traffic jams and congestions are a common feature on most roads around the world .so that your travelling time is unnecessarily multiplied by a not very small number .whereas , a public transport system like local trains , subways , metro etc provide a very punctual and time effective way of travelling .be it travelling to office , college , school , movie , stadium , you know exactly how much time the train will take you .so it gives people time for other activities , including relaxation at home or otherwise .but you definitely are nt honking your horn at the car in front of you or scowling at the one next to you in a traffic jam .one has trains and buses plying at most hours of the day .even for the other emergency hours one may hire a cab .also there s much greater awareness today for our environment , so as more and more people get educated about our eco system , the deadly exhalation of toxic gases can be reduced .many cities in the world like tokyo , amsterdam have a cycling culture where it is very normal for people to commute to their workplace on cycles .in fact , most new road projects around the world have a cycling lane as part of the road .so this should also take some heavy load of our roads .also , cycling is an excellent exercise for our bodies .yes , there definitely are occasions when one needs a personal car .like weekend outings , family functions etc .but they are sporadic events and do nt put as much pressure on the roads and the environment as a slow crawl in traffic everyday does .therefore , when it comes to ` cars in use  , for all the economic , environmental and health reasons cited above , and given a general common sensical point of view prevailing , there should be fewer ` cars in use  twenty years from now than there are today .
