although it s essential to have a car these days , it seems to be hader and harder to afford and causes many enconveniance to those who own a car .it s not only because the money but also for enconvineance that people encounter so i think that in twenty there will be less cars in use then today .firstly , oli price has gone up so high in past few years and it became big problem not only for the drivers but also to the economy .i remember when i first started driving in 5 years ago .it wa nt cheap but it was still ok for the convinence that i got from driving cars but when i go to the gas station to fill the tank now , it cost almost double than what it used to be .because of it i try to use public transportation when i go to school instead of driving .secondly , nowadays one family owns more than one car so there are so many cars and there are nt enough space for parking .especially korea , which is very small with high papularity , it is a huse problem now .when people get back from work at night they have to have another `` war  to find a spot to park .it is very annoying because you are already near home but ar nt able to go home because you ca nt find a parking apot .to conclude , having car is not as good as what it used to be , people will decide not to have a car or have less cars in the future .i think that to solve that the problems above people will buy more bycicles or motor-bike in the future .it cost less money and more convineant than having a car .when people start buying them instead of buyinh cars , the number of cars will gradually decrease .
