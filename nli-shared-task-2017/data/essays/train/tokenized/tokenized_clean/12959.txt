i have traveled in many countries with my friends , and my answer for this statement is that it is depend on where we travel , and what purpose we travel .almost all of the countries that i have traveled is developed europian countries , like france , england , germany , and italy .because there are so many travelers there , it is not big deal to travel there without guides .we can find many guide books in bookstore , and we also can find many information about the place we would go on the internet .about communication problem , i only could speak japanese and english , but i did not have big problem traveling there .there are some merit to have tour guide .they must be the specialists of that place , so that all the place they led us to must be something important or great .however , personally i prefer to travel only with my friends because i like to go with flow , in different words , go wherever i want with my feelings .i also like to find nice place where that nobody would come .my main purpose is sightseeing , neither shopping , eating , nor girls-hunting .therefore , for me , it is better not to have guide with me .the problem is when we go to some undeveloped countries or dangerous place , like easten europe , middle east , or south east asia .i have seen one horror movie `` hostle  , which story is like three travelers came to one old easten europe country and kidnapped , got killed by criminal groups .i know the movie is fiction , but it escalate my fear of traveling those undeveloped countries .when we go to undeveloped countries , there is a big problem .we can not get a lot of information about that place .therefore we might step into dangerous area and be harmed without knowing why .also , we might cause problems because of the country s tradition .in that case , i think it is better to ask someone who knows about the place a lot to guide us to avoid dangerous situation .
