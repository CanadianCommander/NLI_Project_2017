whether understanding ideas and concpets is more important than learing facts is a good point to discuss as there many talks going around regarding changing the study patterns in many universities .i believe that it is very inportant for student to understand ideas and concepts because the main aim of education is to gain knowledge .the student goes to school/university in pursuit of knowledge which is based on concepts and ideas .the facts can not be understood or related unless the concept behind the fact is known .for example , one can enjoy beauty of ranibow , but can not understand how it is formed unless he/she knows the laws of dispersion .secondly , understanding ideas and concepts will help student to focus on the studies .the facts can draw student s attention in many directions that will not help him gain enough knowledge and depth about the subject .the understanding of ideas and concepts will help improve thinking ability of a student in right direction .it can help student concetrate more on any subject .the ideas and concpets are usually scietifically proven things which makes them are trustworthy .with only facts , the students can only guess about the reasons behind the facts .no one can answer the reason behind apple falling down from tree without explaining law of gravity .the next reason for me to support this point is that understanding ideas and knowledge can make student organize his/her studies in timely manner with proper focus .this would help a student to gain sufficient knowledge about variety of subjects in a given academic year .if the students concentrates only on facts , he/she will not be able to pay attention to all the subjects taught in the curriculum .this will narrow the future scope for the students .lastly , i feel that understanding ideas and concepts can help students to come up with new reasearch on certain things happening around us .the students can form baseline with the help of ideas and concepts already known and can explore the unknown things .thruogh their research .this can result in many further developements in our life such as new medicines that are more effective , technology to help improve our day to dat activities , etc . .with all thes points , i strongly feel that it is more important for stduents to understand ideas and concepts than to leearn facts so as to gaim more knowledge about variety of subjects wihtin give academic time which can help them to broaden their future scope and carrier .
