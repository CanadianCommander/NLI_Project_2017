in my point of view , i disagree the following statement for several good reasons .before mentioning my reasons for disagreing this statement , let us think about what the world would be like in 20 years time .would you think that the world s population would increase or decrease ?the answer of this question would make the difference of the number of cars in the next 20 years from today .first of all , i would like to answer my own question , and i actually think that indeed the population all around the world would increase .for a start , let us discuss this related to my place of living/country .if the number of people increased , then the number of people who need living would increase , therefore the number of people who need money will increase and nearly everybody needs transport .either to work , home , office or any other place around the country .so that would increase the number of cars needed for transportation .secondly , these days the technology is getting better and better .nearly every month a new car is gettig published or produced in market .which means many people would like to get a new 2006 car , but actually maybe 50 % of the car s production gets sold , im not trying to be accurate with my numbers but im just giving an example .last but not least , the car companies these days are everywhere , i mean exactly everywhere .where ever you go there are these adverstisements about this new 2006 car , or your city bank gives you discount if you want to get this type of car .so many factors may help you in getting a new car .lastly , i would like to say that why could nt we combine technology with saftey together ?i mean large number of cars means high pollution , which means environmental damage , so i wish that one day i could use a car that works on h2o ( water ) instead of petrol !
