i agree with this statement .young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse they have no problems , or at least very smalls one to compare with olders , that make them tired .in fact , if we stop now thinking about their simple day , we can observe that they have no other thing to do enjoying themselves .on the contrary , older people have too many problems and things to do during their simple day as work , children , parking , traffic and a hundreds else .in my particular case , i live alone in milano and i have to do a thousands things all the day so i can-t leave time to relax myself with the consequences that i-m often tired and i never smile .i clearly remember when i was young and how the days run speedly with no problem , but it is live .i think that we have to re-discover the young there is in all of us because it is the only way to become a smily person < and i believe that it is possible staying closely with youngs - life .i think that they possess the correct kind to live the life , the only one we lost when we are young .
