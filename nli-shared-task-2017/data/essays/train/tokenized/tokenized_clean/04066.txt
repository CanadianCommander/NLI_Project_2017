the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a fairly debatable statement .my opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement .i am of the view that one can not measure how much life can be enjoyed or life is being enjoyed by any one .some one appropriately said `` enjoyment is not a commodity , it is the excitement of life we all live for  .enjoyment mean different things to different people , different peaople dirive enjoyment out of different things .a younger person who is more outgoing enjoys by going partying or meeting people at social events .a sports fan enjoys by watching his favourite team winning a championship .a young girl enjoys shopping for hours with her friends , whereas an older person derives pleasure and enjoyment by wathcing his/her grandchildren playing in his/her lap or talking to his children about their successus or achievements .different people have different ways to enjoy life and everyone is entitled to this right .so we can not justify that older people do nt enjoy as much as younger people do .older people have their on ways to enjoy life equaly as much as younger people .with age only the speed of ones life decreases but the spirit of life remains the same .with age only the amount of activity decreases not the frequency of joyful moments .this statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  in my opinion is a superstition .one which should not be encouraged .we should not forget that these very old people were once young themselves and enjoyed life the same way as younger people today .the younger people of today will only realize that older people have different ways of enjoyment when they are in their shoes .untill we do nt experience the otherside ourselves we are can not make a fair judgement .
