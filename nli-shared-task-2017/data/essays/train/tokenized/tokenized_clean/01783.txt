no i do not agree with this statement .i belive that there are many reasons why there will not be fewer cars in twenty years , some of which are that :firstly , twenty years is not exactly a long period of time so i do not believe that in this period , scientists will be able to invent new ways or methods of transport for the millions of people using cars .even if they did have ideas and samples of inventions , it would either take to long to put into practice for the public or simply too expensive for many people ot use .in addition to all of this , many people are simply content with using cars nowadays so therefore there is not so much of a concern in finding news means of transport but more of an effective one .cars are still in use .the only difference nowadays is that scientists are trying ot find more effective and environmentally friendly sources to use in cars .so there probably would not be a decline in the number of cars used but a decline in the number of inneffective cars in use .for this reason there will probably not be much of a difference in twenty years .also , if anything , there will probably be more cars on the road in twenty years .due to the poplutation increases globally , there will probably be an increase in demand for cars , with respect to transport for people .this increase in people will probably reuslt in the urgence to find new means of transport but twenty years is not a long enough period of time for such drastic changes .so in conclusion , there will probably be many more cars running on the roads in twenty years which is the near future , then there are now .
