the issue of the reliability of advertising is controversial due to the impact it has on consumers and authorities .on the one hand , companies need to advertise their products and create awareness in their target audience consumer s mind .but on the other hand , the actual market is constantly under pressure , as well as its workers who have obligations regarding the company they belong to .however , sometimes we could argue that enhancing the reality of a product in order to achieve good results and sell more of it remains strongly unethical .the first reason why advertisers should not make the product they are selling seem much better than it really is , is simply because they will not attract consumers on the long run .indeed consumers might try the product once but if their expectations are not fully satisfied according to what they saw in the advertising , they will not repeat the buying process .in the same way , by doing so , consumers will lose faith in the brand which is advertising .as a result they will turn toward more reliable companies and products .this could have a very negative impact on the companie s results .for instance , a company which would claim the efficienty of its washing machine amoung the other on the market without the actual benefits would certainly lose u increasing number of its target audience .as a conclusion , i firmly believe that advertisers should not allow themselves to lying to their customers so that they will gain consumers attention and trial .
