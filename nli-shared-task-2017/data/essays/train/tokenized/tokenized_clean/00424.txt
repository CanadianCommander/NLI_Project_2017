this is controversial issue to decide whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to just specialize in one specific subject .depending on personal experience and emotinal concern , we may find that some people will agree the statement , on the other hand , some people will choose the opposite decision .the choice , nevertheless , is hard to make .however , from my point of view , it is wise to agree the statement .my auguments are listed as following .the essectial reason can by seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the requirement of our morden scoial and the work you have .when i entered into the social and starting my first task , i know that knowledge of one specific subject is not enough .for example , when you examining project finance in bank , you should know many things relating to accounting , project analyzing , risk management .during the process of examing those projects , it will be difficult for persons majoring in financing to analyzing the prospect of project such as steal , mobile and telecommunication .so , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help you solve those problems .another reason of my view is that the trendency of the development of science .for example , accounting belongs to the economic science and information theory belongs to the communication science .however , the blend of the theory of accounting and informaiton in the last centry produced a new catelog named the theory of accounting information .so , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may spur the development of science .though i agree that there may be a piece of advantage of specializing in one specific subject , the disadvantages are abvious such as lagging the development of morden social and science .to sum up , given these reasons that are discussed above , i strongly commit to the notion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
