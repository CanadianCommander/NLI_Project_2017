i diagree with this statement : in my opinion you should concentrate on one - or at most two - academic subjects .the first reason you should do so is that academic subjects and modern sciences have developed to a pretty high level .furthermore , a lot of ways to specialize - meaning minor topics - are available in each distinct subject .thus , you may not gain the abilities and experience which is necessary to work as a profession in a certain subject , if you do not concentrate on this single one eagerly .second , if you keep on wandering among too many subjects during your time at college or university you may easily loose track of what you are heading for with your education .on the contrary , if you stick to one paticular subject there will not be too much difficulty in earning a master s degree in this one within a usual period of time .i have made the experience of studying mathematics and physics both as majors at the same time myself .although these subjects are definetely related to each other and one might guess that there are a lot of connections which make it easier to advance in these ones than it would be with any different combination , it still is very demanding : working on both subjects has taken almost all of my time and thereby did not leave much room for leisure activities not related to university .furthermore , i sometimes felt like being lost in a sea of too many choices : as a result of my intense studies i got to know really a lot of minor subjects which i could specialize on in my diploma thesis and most of which seemed to be interesting .thus , i felt like sticking at a point where it was hard to make a decision ; had i not started off with both subjects , the decision which topic to work on would be easier , as i would not have come in touch with so many promising topics .in addition , it would definitely not be possiple for me to work on one more subject no matter how few the additional workload might be .finally , instead of working on too many subjects , i would recommend everyone to train his so called `` soft skills  .this means that people should try to engage in community activities and social programms rather than working on another academic subject .this will give them a sense of how to work with different people , which is really important for their future carrer : for business as well as for university research it is important to effectively work , discuss and find proper solutions together with other persons .resulting from these reasons my conclusion is that you should not try to master as many academic subjects as possible , but rather try to concentrate on one academic subject and different social activities .
