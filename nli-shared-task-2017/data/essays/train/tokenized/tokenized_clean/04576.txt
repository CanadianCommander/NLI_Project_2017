i agree partially with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i think that joining a group led by a tour guide is the best way to visit a place for the first time .i also belive that visiting the same place on my own for the second time is a good way to discover more informations .i usually prefer to take part in a tour guided group when i visit a place for the first time .it gives me the opportunity to meet new people from different cultures and learn more detailed information abuot the history and the secrets of the place .however , i also like to visit places on my own after i was there with a group led by a tour guide .two years ago i went to rome and i decided to join a group of people that had a tour guide , it was amazing and the guide was really knowledgeable .he gave us a lot of artistic and historical informations about the famous roman ruins but at the end of the tour the guide said that because of the short time available , we could nt visit all the important attractions .i was really curious to see what we missed so i decided to go back in such a marvellous city full of imponent structures of the past .last year , i returned in rome and i really enjoyed my time discovering all of the particular things that were not mentioned in the previous tour .i also experienced the famous italian food in such nice restaurants that are spread out all around the historical area .i could feel the real essence of a city where the ancient ruins are mixed with things of everyday life .that was defenetly the best experience of my life and i could nt have the possibility to enjoy it , neither going there on my own for the first time , nor just going there with a group led by a tour guide .
