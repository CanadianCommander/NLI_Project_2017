learning is a natural process that everybody owns , most of children go to school and start learning very early .the point is , do they really know what they are doing or do they just learn without understanding ?we will see what is the most important for a student , learn facts or understand ideas and concepts ?in my opinion , we can not separate those two parts one from each other .it is impossible to understand a theory or a process if we do not know the underlying elements ( the facts ) .i would say that both parts of the statement must be given an equal importance .it is the basis of the knowledge that to learn facts and use them in various situations ( talks , lectures or projects ) .otherwise we would not be able to speak or communicate to each other .this is our general knowledge .in the other hand , you learn facts or lessons by heart , it is often not very usefull , because a few days later it is almost impossible to remember everything we learned .for example , for my a level in france ( baccalaureat )i had to learn by heart maps of europe or usa describing either population or exchanges etc .the month after i was not able do draw it again because it came out of my mind .i agree that sometimes it is useless to learn facts .precisely in the case if we know we will not practice what we learned anymore .regarding understanding of ideas or concepts , this is a very important process for a student .that is how people acquire a specific state of mind , and with practice things can be understood faster and faster .the purpose of an idea is to be well understood and this idea has no reason to exists if not so .therefore i would give a special importance to the understanding of concepts and ideas too .
