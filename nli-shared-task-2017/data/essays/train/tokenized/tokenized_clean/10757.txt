a growing number of people believe that specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for students than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .however , contrary to the popluare trend , i strongly believe that broad knowledge is better for students .the rationale behind this is that it helps students to be well-arouned people .in addition , students can work better after hiring in company .first of all , broad understanding of various academic subjects plays a pivotal role in rasing students well-rounded people .it is largely because , if people learn only one speific subject , the life would be boring and they can not understand other aspects of life .learning other subjects can broaden their horizen .for example , my major was chemistry in university .however , i attend other classes like art , writing .therefore , i can write better and understand other people well .it made my life more affluent .secondly , broad understanding of diverse subjects contributes to working better in companies .it is largely because , when students learn various kinds of subjects they not only understand their parts of the work but also they can grasp the other role s of other people s work .therefore , they can work more effectively .to be specific , my friend , jihuen was hired by hyundai , which build the apartments .even though her major was architect she had to attend the art class and when she work at the company she could do well , because she could design better .in conclusion , having broad knowledge is more helpful for studnets .it is because students can be more well-rounded and work better when they hired .
