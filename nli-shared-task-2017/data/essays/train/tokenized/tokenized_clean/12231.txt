is advertisement misleading ?that i think the way we can rephrase this statement .the question implies that actually yes it might be the case .but let s review what is advertisement and discuss whether the process is aimed at `` embellishing  the truth ?what is the role of advertisement ?it is , i believe to make aware the largest population of consumers possible of the existence of a new product .so advertisement technically has a value of information .at the same time it has the mission to promote to graeter number of people the product .the ultimate aim of the advertisement is to convince the majorite of consumers to buy the product .but i believe there is clear distinction between informing a poulation of the existence of a new product and promoting a product .informing is communicating facts in its minimal and truthful way .for example , a new drug comes to the market and as health advocate you want to inform the community and health professionals .what are you going to tell thes professionnals ?you will give all the elements about the drug ( chemical entity , mechanism of action ) that help people to understand what it is , who it is for , and what are the risks associated with its use .now when you see the avertisement for a drug , a drug for arthritis ( painfull debilitating disease ) for example what do you see ?the add tells you what it is and who can benefit from it .but it is also showing you some great , slim , lady happily jumping , running , .in addition , in many cases , it s also telling you that it s much better than so and so .so what does it mean .is this drug much better your cure ?does the advertisemnt refklects tells you what to expect from tyhat drug ?my answer to that is not so simple .the advetisemnt is not lying but it does nt give you the real facts , the truth .it does nt telll you , for example , thatthis drugs is good f for only one category of the population , that drug may have some unplaesant side effect .so my advice : be circumspect when it comes to advertised drugs .
