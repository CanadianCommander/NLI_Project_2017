the question if young people enjoy their life more than older people is hard to answer generally .i would not say that this is always true , but for most of the cases i agree with the statement .i think that young people are more free in their thinking in the way that they are often not think about the consequences first .they put many things not in considerations .they just do it .my younger brother for example , he is 19 , is often going to travel without beeing worried about what comes next .i think he is a quite happy person who really enjoys his life .older people , in contrast , see the same things often with different eyes .they have much more life experiance and another view on many things and i think this is often a more negative view .older people thinks about consequensives first and are often more worried about what could happen in a negative way instead of how could this be enjoyable for me .my mother for example was grown up in the communist system and was treatend badly .nowadays she is a very pessimistic person and has mostly bad oppinions about things which i see actually positive .sometimes i think she is not enjoying her life that much .my brother and me are grown up in another environment than my parents .we were grown up in a surrounding of freedom and had less worries in our young life then my parents had during their youth .this is one of the reasons that i agree to the statement that older people enjoy life less than younger do , in most of the cases .surely i think that in other cases older people are enjoying their live as same as younger do or even more .
