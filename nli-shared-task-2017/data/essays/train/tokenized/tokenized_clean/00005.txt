in my opinion the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .the other option would be to go alone or in a small group of two to three people without a tour guide .the advantages of travelling in a group led by a tour guide are :1. the vacation time will be utilized efficiently .2. we can concentrate on sightseeing and enjoy more .3. it is safer4. we may get discounted tickets for tourist attractions .let me elaborate on these points .since , the tour guide is well familiar with the tourist destination , he can make a detailed schedule of our day to day activities .also , he will manage our time in such a way that we are able to visit all the important points of attractions .and because he will be involved in planning and driving we can spend more time relaxing and enjoying .this is specially important for couples , as they will get more quality time to spend with each other .on the contrary , if you travel alone or in a small group without a travel guide , you are responsible for managing all aspects of the trip .this may lead to inefficient planning and waste of time .it is also safe to travel in a group and with a person who is aware of good and bad neighborhoods .one of my friends once went to a foreign country for vacation .he did not arrange for a tour guide .unfortunately , he was mugged the very first day of his trip and was stabbed in the stomach too .thus , ruining his vacation plans completely .additionally , most of the tour guides have contacts with local merchants and attraction managements .hence he may be able to arrange for discounted food and entertainment tickets .who does nt like to save some extra money ?finally , i would like to repeat that i strongly suggest travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
