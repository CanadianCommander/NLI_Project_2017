since different people have different life activities and styles , it is really difficult to generalize if youg people enjoy life more that older people do .however , from my experience , i think that older people enjoy life more than ypung poeple do .first of all , many young people do nt have freedom while the olders do .for instance , they have to belong to schools to ged education , and they have to study seriously every day as long as they want to get a blight future which is essentially to get a good salary job and family .to study is one of the most stressful activities they experience .on the other hand , it is more likely for the olders to forcus their lives on what they really want to do such as hiking and traveling .for instance , i am a college students so that i do not have time to spend for my hobbies such as rockclimbing and swiming in the semester .and i envy older people who enjoy riding a bike .secondly , teenagers tend to have difficulties to establish a good relationships with others and have other serious distress such as family probrems .this actually make many of them commit suiside .young people tend to depend on their parents so that they do nt have any abillity to change their lives .as a consequence , it is more difficult for younger people to have time to enjoy their lives .finally , young people do nt have good economical or finacial establsiment so that they tend to have money problems while older people do .to have joyful time , money is essence .if you do nt have enough money , i connot enjoy you life .therefore , older people have more time to enjoy life .each peason has different life in different age so that it is not possilble to detrermine whether young people enjoy life more that older people do .however , again , older people have more opportunities to have time to enjoy their lives , according to my experience .
