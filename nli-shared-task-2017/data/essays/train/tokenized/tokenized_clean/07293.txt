some people say it s better to specialize in one specific subject .but i think it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for two reasons .therefore , i agree this statement .there are advantages to specialize in one thing .and also it s needed in some occupations .a example which makes this clear is that a pilot needs special knowledge about an airplane and how to fly it .but i find more advantages to study many academic subjects .first , i think if thier knowledge are broad , they can have wider view .for instance , as an internet service has invented and a better transportation system has developed , you go abroad more frequently .also you become to see many people who have different backgrounds .at that time , you have to recognize and understand other culture or history .if you do nt have a wide view , you ca nt understand and it may be a conflict .second , today , t s really complicated connected society so it s really important to study several academic subjects .for example , if you are a doctor , you must know how new machines works too .if you know about the mechanism of human body , it s meaningless .these days there are so many high tech machines or robots .so doctors need to know high level phisics too .overall , i think we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , as we can get wider view .also , because a society is complicately connected .
