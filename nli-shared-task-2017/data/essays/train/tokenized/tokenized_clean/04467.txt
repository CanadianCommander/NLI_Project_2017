in my opinions , i totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .there are main three reasons : basic , creation , knowledges .first reason is that when i do something in school , job ans so on , understanding ideas and concepts always can be based for doing it .for example , when i am working in my job , i got complicate problems , so i am trying to solve by using many ways .however it is not working , what do i do ?i need to look over again very carefully and i should understand that problem clearly .and then i would think about its basically ideas and concepts .i must try to understand that .after that i might solve that problem by understanding its ideas and concepts .therefore , when i do whatever , understanding ideas and concepts is really important .second reason is that understanding ideas and concepts can improve my creation abilities and thinkings .if i just do something without thinking or understanding , it can be mixed up and i can not get good achivements .maybe i just would work , such as machines .therefore , if i allways try to understand ideas and concepts , it can improve my creation ablities and thinkings , so i would do greatly .final reason is that i can get many background knowledges by understanding ideas and concepts .to live in society , all people need variety background knowledges as well as many experiences .to understand ideas and concepts of something what i want to get , i should try to study its basically ideas and concepts , also i need to look for many things , such as books , articles to understand .as i study like this , i can get many knowledges more and more .therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is really good to get background knowledges .in conclusion , according to these reasons , i totally agree with that understanding ideas and concepts is very important to improve myself by these reasons above lists .
