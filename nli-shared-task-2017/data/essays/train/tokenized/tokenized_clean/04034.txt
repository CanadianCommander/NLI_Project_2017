in reference to the proposed question i must say i m mostly disagree .nowadays young people probably have more free time than ever .if only they dedicate a little part of their free time to help each other in their communities , a lot of problems could be reduced , not only for the community that receives the colaboration , also for young people who participates .conciencing youth about enviromental problems in their own towns or cities could make they were more responsable to the nature .i also think that it could prevent the youth to be atracted by drugs in general and alcohol in particular .in the other hand it s true that young people nowadays have more expectatives of the society over them and they also have more stress .i also must say that young people now can have more and more free time posibilities , and for much of them it  s hard to renounce to them .in part our society is more individualist in our time , as a whole , not only the youth .because of this , all adults may participate helping their communities , not only young pepole .there are a lot of activities that both boys and girls can do : working for old peolple ; childcare ; enviromental works , such as conservation of local fauna or helping in the plantation of trees ; cleaning the roads near towns . ..
