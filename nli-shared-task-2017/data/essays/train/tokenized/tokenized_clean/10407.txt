to be able to take part in the competitive world , people must be more qualified than before .everyone is trying to improve their skills by attending to certificate programmes , seminars , internship programs or attending to the top ranked schools .the education they get there is a big step for their careers .especially students feel big pressure on themselves , since they do not know where they will be after they finish their education and if they will be able to play a role in this global world .hence , they try to do their best at school by studying their courses , doing homeworks , getting good grades .however , after they complete all these requirements they may not reach their goals unless they .learnt to understand the ideas and concepts .the education system forces students to learn what is written in the course materials .it is easy to memorise all the facts in the books and get good grades .however , these learnt facts will be forgotten quickly and easily .hence , it is important to understand the basic ideas behind the subjects and question everyting to gain permanent knowledge .for instance , a student taking a political science course may have an assignment about the differences between political views .he may study the different types of views like nationalism or fundemantalism .if he understands the basic idea behind those , he will never forget or confuse them .however , if he just learns the facts it is possible that his knowledge will not last long .as a student , i believe that it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn the facts in order to gain permanent knowledge .if a student is aware of the subject , he will be more likely to improve his skills and qualifications .in my opinion understanding the consepts is the core for self development and may give you the chance to play a big role in the competitive world .
