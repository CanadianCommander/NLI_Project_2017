i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .first , most advertisements tell us the adventages of the products and do not mention the disadvantades .advertisements are generall short .in order to inpress people advertisements have to say the most inportant advantage and do not have time to tell people the shortcomes .so people will consider the products better than they really are .second , some products have different effects to different people .it is good to you , maybe it is no effects on me .the advertisements only give us the good example , such as the drug for lossing weight .my friend use many kinds of products to loss weight .every time she told me that she have seen the result of using this products from advertisements , but she disppointed every time .third , some advertisements use inaccrute word .for example , a advertisement said that the drug for lossing weight is very , very effective .but what means `` very , very effective  ?every person has his/her own oppoinons .some people think it means that this will decrease 10 % of weight , but other people think it means to decrease 20 % of weight .to the factory of this goods , `` very , very effective  maybe means decrease 5 % .so i think i can not beleive all of what the advertisements said .
