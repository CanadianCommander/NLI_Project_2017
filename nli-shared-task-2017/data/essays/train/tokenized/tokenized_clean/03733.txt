i totally agree with the statment that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in my opinion , as time goes by , the world is improving , and so do ourselves .we need to improve ourselves everyday to be successful .i believe that trying new thing and take tisks is the best way to improve ourselves .as the environment is moving on , we meet new things .since we are not familiar with it , we should spent time to find out what it s all about .in that case , risks is unavoidable because we do nt know what s going to happen .in the progress , we can find out and learn a lot of precious knowledge that we never knew .in that case , we re improving .in the progress , we may face a great difficulty , which is very hard to solve .when we managed to solve the problem , we gain experiences .in this way , we make the new things into the things that we already know .so we can learn more things if we try new things .for the more , i believe that trying new things can make us more intellegent .we face different things so that we think about different things .our brain can recieve a better practice .as a result we can be more intellegent .on the contrary , if we do nt try new things and take risks , the only thing we could do is to repeat doing the same thing that we already know .that would have a bad effect on ourselves .when more and more new things arrive , we still know nothing about them .so we would no longer be competitive .in other word , we would not be successful .as trying new things can improve ourselves , make us learn more about the world , let us be more intellegent , i believe that trying new things and take risks is more likely to make successful people .
