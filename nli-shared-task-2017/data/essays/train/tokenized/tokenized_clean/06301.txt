most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i do not agree oder disagree with this statement , because on one hand there are many products , which have very bad advertisment but are very usefull and effective .on the other hand , the products with the biggest and greatest advertisment can be unusful and uneffective products for me .it depens also on the intress of people .everybody in the world has diffrent subject in which he is intressted .for example a man who loves car will be able to decide if the advertisment for a new car is much better then the car is in reality or if the advertisment just exactly show the quality of the car .a other man , who hate cars , who just move by his feeds because he thinks that cars are bad for the enviroment will say , that the advertisment is bad .or that the makers of it just want to make money .an other different by giving the right mark for the advertisment is the age .the more years a human has lived , the more things he know .for a little boy for exaple impressed the new car much more then the man , who loves car .because the man saw so many cars bevor in his live and for him its just something he now in a new way and teh little boy , for him it is not just a new car , it is something new in generally , because he have not known it bevor .i think that you can not say that a advertisment is bad , bacause the people for whom the advertsiment was made maybe think that this a great advertisment .i just can say for the advertisment i am intrested in show most of the time a good advertisment .when i tried a new product , for exaple a shampoo , what was advertised as the best shampoo ever on tv , the advertisment was not always right but some times .all in all you have to be intrested in the prodcut and you need a liitle knowlegde to decide if it is good or not , you have to think about , that other people has not the same opinion as you , and you have to think about if this product , which has a good or bad advertisment is the only one between many , or if there are many good or bad ones .
