i personally believe that one of the main traits of successful people , is their ability to try new things and take risks , while keeping a very moderate and limited approach in life will probably diminish a lot the opportunities of a person .in my opinion the key aspect is being open to new ideas , trends and influences because only by having an approach like this you learn about new things , push your boundaries and discover new opportunities .all of these require a fair amount of risk .i do nt neccessarily agree that the more risk there is involved and the better it is .i just think that by taking calculated risks a person could incredibly increase it s chances for success .a perfect example is my grandfather .he was a small carpets wholesaler in italy in the mid 60 s , when he realized that he could have made much more money if he went directly to turkey , and directly imported carpets from there .he was the first one to do it , and when the other dealers heard what he wanted to do , most of them tought that he had lost his mind .it soon turned out to be a very smart idea , and within a couple of years he became the biggest wholesaler of antique rugs in europe .i think that the approach that a person chooses depends a lot from it s aspirations .not everyone wants to become rich , powerfull or successful , some people are happy with what they have and do nt see the need for change .this is why they keep on doing what they already know how to do well .the problem is that if what you know to do well , for any reason is not good enough anymore you are in big trouble .some one could know very well how to use the telegraph , the problem is that today most people either use telephones , fax machines and email .these tools achieve the same thing , in a better and faster manner .the way that i try to leave my life is by bein open to new influences , trying new things , taking calculated risks with the hope one day of becoming successful
