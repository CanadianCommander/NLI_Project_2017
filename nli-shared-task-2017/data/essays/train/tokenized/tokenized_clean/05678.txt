i agree with the sentence that most advertisements and most negative spots make products seem much better than they really are .this is real for lots of reasons .firstly , a company which product a good or a service want always show the best in its business expecially when it want to compete with another group wich sell to people the same article .for this reason they often tell people lies about their good through television , city posters or magazines and people trust it , but when someone buys their famous thing , is not really how they describe to us !for example , one day my mother had decided to buy an hair-phon which should resist to water and repared you from electrical waves but when it fall in the ground with some water drops she broke it .she was so scared !secondly , for new objects we have not the idea of the name of who product it .if i buy a valentino s dress i think it would be better then an h & m s one because the name is very important and show you the past of a work group .the companies which obtain the fame with their goods and their service have a best expectative in the consumer and the satisfaction of an expectative create fedelty in the buyer .in conclusion , i think advertisements are often a lie or an enlargement of the real usefulness of an object but i think also that someone with their work have increase their fame in people in a good way .
