in todays world of information overload the specialist are much more neccesary than the generalist in order to further take steps in our technological development .fisrt off all although it neccesary to see the wide picture when faced with the problems the solution to the problem relies on specific knowledge of the problem .for instance an academician with wide range of knowledge in engineering may easily realize the problem in assembeling a robot where knowledge from several fields engineering is needed much more quicker than a specifically trained engineer who can point out the problems associated with his special knowledge .with his wide range of knowledge he can say that the electrical circuitrary is not working correctly .but in order the fix the problem he has to need help from an electrical engineering .secondly a in todays world information is very extensive for one to collect and digest .people have to specilaze on one subject .the development of technology forces us to specialize in onet .in the early days of humanity it is logical to expect an academician to know everything about the all science fields .but nowadays things are getting much more complicated that one can handle .we have diverse society to many fields and wait them to communicate each other .last but least you can see many people having diverse knowledge about all issues but not specified in one of those .those people are not valued by the humanity and no one can remember them in future .for instance a primary school teacher have to have broad knowledge of all science fields .he is just the first step of the development .although he is essential for the maintainance of the development he can not add new bricks to the scientific literature .as you progress in your academic studies you can also realize that academiciens getting more and more specialized .those academicians are at the top of the development that struggle for the research .those will be remembered because of their support to the science .all in all specialist are much more needed in our society where it is impossible for one to digest all information .specialist are the people who we are bound to in technological development .i can not deny the importance of the generalists but they just constitute the basic of the building .if we want to build new floors we have to promote specialists .
