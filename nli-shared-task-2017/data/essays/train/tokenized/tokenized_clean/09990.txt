human behaviours can be affected by lots of changes like living standards or technology or geneticly .whatever the reason today s adults are insensitive to their society s problems .we can categorize these reasons into two groups such as external and internal effects which may cause children do not give enough time to helping their communities .the internal effects are the first reason that makes children stray away from their communities .parents have the biggest responsibilty about ths issue .they should explain and direct their children to understand and like helping to others .in additon , television and games make children asocial .for example , most children likes playing with computers than going out .this makes children not aware of what is happening in the world or society or even in their house .the external effects are the second main reason why young people do not give enough time to helping .competition in school or working areas make people work harder and harder .people became robots thinking only their things to do but nothing else .in addition to competition , money is another cause .some people forget their culture and responsibilities to their environment n order to make more money .to sum up , because of external effects including insensitive parents , television and computer games and internal effects consist of competition and wanting more money can make young people do not give enough time and effort to helping their communities .
