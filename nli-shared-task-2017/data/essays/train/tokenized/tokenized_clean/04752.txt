young people do enjoy life more than older people do .in my opinion , young people take more chances and risks , as well as they try to experience numerous things when they get a chance .this because they have been presented more options in life , they are not as careful with their health as older people are , and they like to try new things in every occasion they can find .life has evolutionized and changed in many aspects in this last century .young people like to take chances and go for what them want .they tend to look beyond what is presented to them , and go beyond what is traditionally expected .sometimes the choice of something new and different may not be there , but young people will look for it , they will expand their horizons and go further out their boundaries .old people have more traditions to follow .family values are strongly present in their daily lives , so they have to follow certain life styles that young people are not very interested in .when taking a risk , their is always a fifty percent chance it might work or it might not .that is what taking a risk involves .older people are most conservative and might be more afraid to take a risk .a young person is starting his or her life , and might see things differently .they could see their future as an uncertainty for the present time , and might be less skeptical to go for it and take the risk of losing something .different than older people , they might not have a family to provide to or worry about .they might only need to worry about themselves .the value of things is less important , because it might only have a monetary value , and not a sentimental value .this because they are young and have not been around for a long time .older people might appreciate things more , since they have been here for longer .they apply more value to things like a bracelet or ring , than just a financial price .a young person might think that if they lose it , they can replace it from any jewelry store .some experience comes from practice .it can be practice that takes a long time to achieve or simply practice that can be learned quickly by doing it a lot in a short period of time .older people are supposed to have more experience than young people .but it might be in fewer areas .young people like to experience new things and try differrent things .they are more open and know that the world has many different things to offer , so they try most of them or as many as possible .they are young and healthy , which allows them to travel easier , and eat more ethnic foods .in the other hand , older people have to take better care of their bodies , since their health is more at risk .they ca nt travel long distances and might need medications that are not always available everywhere .so they are not able to enjoy life as much as young people can .
