when you buy a product yo do it for many reasons , maybe because it is neccesary for you , maybe because you like it or maybe because someone or something says to you that such product is excellent but , is it really true ?well , i think that this can happen with advertisements .it is fantastic how persuasive advertisements can be .they show the best of the product but obviusly , they do nt describe , if there are , the bad part of them .but like all in this world it will depend on each situation .on one hand for example , there are really good products that can fill all your expectatives and they are just what you are looking for .so , with products like these , i wait that advertisements tell me all the propierties of the product and that they give me the true reasons to buy it .but on the other hand , you can feel very dissapointed if you aqcuire a product that is not the same as you believe .and this could be worst when you do that because in the advertisement the product really seem much better .nevertheless , you can reclaim to change the product but this could not always be possible .in my case for example , i had bought hundreds of thinks in order to put on slime , but i realiced now that the only think that works is less food and more exercise .if i have to sum up i will give you an advice : do nt believe so much on advertisements .not always they reflect the true about a product .you have to be sure yourself before aqcuire somethik .
