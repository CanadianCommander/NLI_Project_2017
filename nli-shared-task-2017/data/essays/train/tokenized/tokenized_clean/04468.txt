many people say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .personally , i firmly disagree with the state that there will be fewer cars in the future .i have two main reasons to support my position .to begin with , i believe that there will be more population in the world in twenty years .it is no doubt that there will be more cars at that time since car is the main transportation .to cite the first example , people need car especially the of developing country .it is the truth that the public transportation is more unconvenient than the developed country .unfortunatelly , the developing country often has fast-growing population .consequently , the only thing they can do is to buy a car .in addition , i think that car is a tool we use to judge a man .car is not only a product , it is the symbol of the property , to cite the seconde example , we usually compare our car with other s .i had seen many young people who want buy a new car even though they do nt have enough money , besides , the advertisement also help us regarde car as an symbol of future .considering the above reasons , while there are many people think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , i choose to differ .i firmly believe that car will be more important in the future .
