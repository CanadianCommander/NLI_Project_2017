there is no doubt about the fact that some people are not able to differentiate between the ideas and concepts versus facts .what i normally do and follow is to learn about the ideas and concepts first and then connect it with the facts .so , for me understanding ideas and concept is far more important as they are universal and is a complete statement in itself .as far as i am concerned , to me ideas and concept , are a kind of universal rule i.e it can be used in more than one situations and / or events .for eg. if i am having clear concept and ideas about any particular thing it becomes lot more easier for me to understand the details though it looks tough .it also helps me to generate an example and explain the same thing in my own words .in addition to it if i am having a strong understanding of the fundametals ( idea and concept )i could apply in any given situation as currently in a toefl exam many a times you had to understand the concept and ideas of the reading and listening passage .secondly , i would like to say that ideas and concepts which we also call fundamentals is complete statement in itself while on the other side facts are incomplete without an idea incorporated in it .for eg. the theorems and formulas used in maths and physics are also a kinds of concept and ideas of solving the problems of calculations ; without this it is impossible to do anything .therefore , i strongly belive that ideas and concepts are definately having an upper hand than the facts in every aspects of life whatsoever .
