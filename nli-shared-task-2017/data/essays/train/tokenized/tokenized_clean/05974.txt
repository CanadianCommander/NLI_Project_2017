i totally agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .they pay little attention to the needs of their communities , acting as if they were not involved .i think there are three main reasons which explain this opportunistic behaviour .first , the governements and the schools do not promote enough the importance of helping the community .i know only few schools which make the social service as part of their curricula .i think that as soon as possible people must learn that the community service is a civil duty .we all belong to the same society , and therefore we must share the tasks .that is why school and universities should consider the comunity service as a prerequisite to be admitted , and also should induce their students to do it during the accademic years .the second reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is that they do not have time .the modern society is mostly based on some values which do not include the community service .the main purpose is to make profit which means that the main value is money .nowadays the competition is radically increasing and therefore the efficiency is becoming crucial .the sooner you are graduate , the sooner you start to work , the sooner you get promoted , the sooner you make more profit .from this point view , it is obvious that young people see the community service as a waste of time .that is why , in order to resolve the problem , the way of thinking should change .unfortunately i think that this will never happen .the global economy promoted by most of the governements inevitably lead young people to act in an opportunistic way .the only chance they have no to be left out is to be efficient .efficiency do not leave time for helping the communities .
