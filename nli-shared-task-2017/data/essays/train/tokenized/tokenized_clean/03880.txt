when was signed the human right declaration ?who signed it ?where ?are you sure to remember all the anwers by heart ?if not , do not need to conclude that you are a bad person who does not know anything .however , this conclusion can be easily reached if you do not know the objectives of the declaration and its importance .maybe this example is not the best but it helps me to explain that even if facts are important , understanding ideas and concepts is a priority .when students are going to school , they want to learn to better comprehend their environment .to reach these objectives , they have to think , ask questions and learn ideas and concepts .ideas have the advantage to be transversal and be re-use on different subjects .indeed , the example of the human rights is not only an historical element but also a philosophical and anthropological question .by knowing the concepts , students can make cross-over and see how some themes are connected .facts are still useful but they are mainly illustrations , examples .they give value added to students to apprehend their lessons to give a practical dimension to a theorical problem .they should be highly regarded and well-used , however , they should not be seen as the ultimate goal .knowing fact without being able to relate them to some ideas is a waste of time .a person is not more intelligent by the amount of information he knows but by the quality and his ability to use it .therefore , students should learn to think no only to repeat .finally , once students have ideas and concepts in their mind , learning facts is not the most difficult thing to accomplish .our world with the help of images , television , media is full of facts .you open any newspaper you will find fact on a multitude of subject .the real difficulty is to analyze them .that is why i will definetely encourage students to take some distance from facts , think , and try to make some relationship with ideas and concepts .by that way , they will add value added to their work and remember easily the different historical date , names and facts !
