cars have been well developed nowadays , they have become a common tool in our daily lives .few issues are as likely to attrct widespead pulic attention as that concerning the using of a car .i hold the notion that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today .there are numerous reasons and agreements to suport my idea .here , i intend to explain couple of them .to start with , cars are signs of weathy , people try best to save enough money to buy cars .my parents often says that when we get enough money , we will buy a bmw .my mother said that she will buy me a car when i get married to show how wealthy she is .and also , my boyfriend always talking about buying a famous car when he earn enough money .all my friends and relatives are dreamed of having cars .people tend to have more money with the fast developing economy , which means that more cars will be owned by families .furthermore , owning a car is very convient to any places .for example , i live in a countryside .there i only one bus each day heading the capital beijing .so each time i want to go to beijing , i will ask my uncle who has a car to send me to beijing .this time , i went to beijing to have the toefl test was the same .i always dreamed of having a car by my own .there are so many people that complained the inconvinence of not having a car .despite such siginificant evidences that show the cars will not be reduces , some disagreements still exist .some one argue that cars are so polluted .the government are trying to limited personal cars .although i can not deny that there is minor tendy for decreasing cars , i believe the proportion for the increasing amount of cars is much lager .both for personal desire and convinent puporse .from what has been discussed above , i can safely draw the conclusion that the amount of cars in use in twenty years will be much more than today .
