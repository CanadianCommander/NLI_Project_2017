i agree with the opinion that people success more often when they try new things and take risks , rather than only doing what they are already farmiliar with .there are two reasons for this : motivation and chances .first , when people try something that can be challenging to them , they are motivated .in fact , they try their best .when people try their best , they have more chance of succeeding .however , when people do something that they know how to do well , they do not try their best because they already know what the limit is and what they can do with it .however , when people try new things , they are motivated to learn more about it .also , they do not yet know how far they can go with it , so they are motivated to know whay they can do .second , when people try new things , they have more chances to encounter something that is in their interest but did not know the existance of .what they already know how to do well is probablly something that other people already know and is farmiliar to all of them .if they take risks , they are more likely to encounter something that is challenging , but is interesting to them at the same time .if people try things that are uncommon , they are more likely to be succesful because people have not yet explored that territory yet .people can feel that they are doing something special .i believe people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is challenging to take risks , but taking them leads to success .people have more chance of encountering something people can be successful on , which brings up their motivation .
