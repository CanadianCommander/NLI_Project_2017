i definitely agree with this statement .merely learning facts without a real uderstanding of its true meaning is of no use in my opinion .one can have all the knowledge in the world but at the same time can be incapable of putting it to any use .what use is all that knowlege if it ca nt bring about any favourable results !to support by absolute agreement with this statement i am going to tell u about an experience of mine that taught me about the relevance of having a complete understanding as to just knowing the terms .when i was in the 7th grade my parents migrated to the u.s. from india .till then i had only been exposed to the indian ways of education .out here in india we were taught that the only thing that mattered when it came to academics , was how much of text have we been able to mug up .it did not matter whether we actually understood it .the only thing that counted was whether we were able to reproduce it while being tested for it .inevitably , all the data that was memorised was instantly forgotten on the completion of the test .initially when i started studying in the u.s. , the indian method of education worked as a hindrance in being able to adapt to the american style of learning .in america education meant leaning the understanding of ideas and concepts .with the right understanding one would be capable of accessing information related to a particular topic .a simple action of accessing innformation posed itself as a huge task for me .as i had been used to only reproducing without having any understanding of things , i was completely handicapped and did nt know where to begin from .it was this lesson that taught me the necessity of comprehending things over mere memorising .one is better of comprehending less matter as compared to having a whole lot of facts stacked up , which one is incapable of putting to use .do nt get me wrong here .i do not mean to condemn my country s method of education .what i m trying to say here is that , my country should cultivate this statement of `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts  into its academics .
