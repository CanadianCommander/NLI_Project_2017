it is difficult to open a newspaper without being faced with a new comment on what will happen in the future with cars .nowadays , everybody have their own car , and they use it to go anywhere .no matter the distance , they need to go by car .but they do not have a normal car , they have the best one .today lot of young people use their savings to buy a new car while they have not paid their house !is this issue really that important ?it is as it has divided society into two different points of view .on the one hand , a large part of society holds the opinion that cars are a positive thing as they reduce the time people spend at the bus stop .they argue that they do not have to go to the bus stop , then wait there for , more or less , twenty minutes and finally get off the coach and walk during a long time until their destination .going by car let them go faster from their home till where they need .besides , having a car gives them more independence .i mean , they do not have to depend on the schedule of the public transport when they make an appointment .on the other hand , others feel that so many cars in the town has many drawbacks .for instance , the number and duration of traffic jams is increasing .not only the big cities support this problem , but also the small cities that can not afford with all those cars .moreover , the pollution is becoming a seriously problem .the atmosphere is being damaged by the pollution .so we have to be responsible with the environment in order to save our children s life .on balance , the number of cars is increasing each day .that is why i do not agree the statement .i think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than today , in spite of the development of planes , trains , and so .the automobile industry has had an enormous development during the past two decades , and the demand of not only simply cars but also luxury cars is increasing .
