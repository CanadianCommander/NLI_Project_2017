schools are the first learning places for students about the difficulties of life .the symptoms of ` how challenging a life can be  are investigated during the schooltimes .being grown by an educational system of my country which depends on the understanding ideas and concepts , i believe and it is more important that to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .first , a student has to define and digest the thing that he/she is learning .instead of memorizing , one can and has to reason the subject that he/she is learning .by doing that , she/he overcomes the situation of forgetting the important issues .for example , if an experiment is done , the student should understand why and for which reason the experiment is done instead of memorizing the steps of the experiment so that the student will not forget that experiment and will not fail in the exams .second , one can not infer and make comments about a fact .facts are sharp things that one can not make some brainstorming to understand the situation .the people should make some exercises on what they are dealing with .for example if a phenomena is happened .the student should ask why is this happened and for what reason instead of ` ok  this is happened and let it go .to conclude , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .one should examine , digest and come to a level of making some comments on that subject .this is essential for the education systems .
