i agree with the given statement because in my opinion young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .nowadays young people spend their leisure time with playing video games or watching television .they are surfing the internet and are putting on weight .only a few children go outside to play with friends or do team sports .nowadays most of the children are overweighted .they do not learn that there are other people with needs , opinions and feelings , too , which have to be respected just like they want their needs , opinions and feelings to be respected .unfortunately many children only care for themselves and they are not interested in the opinions or feelings of other persons .they do things only for their own advantage and most of them think that it is absolutely unnessesary to help or care for other people .maybe parents should give their children a pet so that the children can learn under the advice of their parents how to take responsibility for another living creature .i guess that helping their communities would show them that they are not alone on earth and that it can be very satisfactory to know that you do something because it helps another person .in every community are several people that could use some help and there are not enough people who can provide this help .young people could visit old people in retirement homes for example .they could take the old people for a walk or talk to them or play card games for example .in a retirement home is not enough staff to care for each of the old people like they would like to .for the young people it would not be much work .they would only have to spend a little time with them .it would make the old people happier and this way the young people would do somthing to help their communities .
