i agree with the statement that products look much better when you see them during advertisements .first of all , i believe that in the society of today televisions and newspapers exercise a great impact on the common understanding of the concept of beauty and effectiveness .this is particollary true when you talk about advertisements .people believe that some products are better than others just because a certain movie star says it !furthermore , considering that most advertisements are proposed by the television , i think that such a tecnology affects the real feeling on the quality of the product .secondly , i have to admit that products seen during advertisements look much better than they really are .they have more colours and they look more appealling than ever , expecially if compared to the ones you receive !finally , i believe that the industry of advertisement reached a very high and professional level .in particular , the advertisement highlits only the good things about a certain product while the negative parts remain hidden and you discover them only when you effectively have the chanche to use the product in your house .even if i strongly believe in what i have written above , last week i was simply too influenced by an advertisement seen on a tv and i bought the product advised therein .such product was a knife supposed to cut any kind of meat and , believe me or not , the advertisement was really convincing , showing a guy who was cutting any kind of beef .unfortunately i received the package yestarday and i found that the knife was just simple as all other knifes that i currently have in my house !this is just an example of how much publicity can influence people .we should try to keep in our mind the principles described above in order to avoid any risk , but sometimes it is simply too hard !
