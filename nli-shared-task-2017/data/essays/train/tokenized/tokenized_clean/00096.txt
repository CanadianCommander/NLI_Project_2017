i disagree with the statement that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than travelling individually without any form of guidence .my opinion is based on my past vacation experience and my personal preferences in regard to organize my vacation time .travelling in a group has the advantage that the traveller is instantly surrounded either by people he or she knows or by other travellers with the same time schedule and intentions .this eliminates the pressure to meet people for the purpose of socializing during vacation .furthermore , hiring or electing a tour guide waives the responsibility to plan and organize time schedules , sleeping arrangements and sight seeing trips to a third person .this reduces the stress and organizational effort prior to and during vacation .on the other hand , it limits the individual possibilities to plan the vacation time according to my own and my fellow traveller s preferences .group trips are rather advantageous for shorter trips .whereas over the period of several days , individual personalities tend to create minor or major conflicts within the group .this is especially true for pretty heterogeneous groups , ranging in age , profession , personal background , etc .whereas the excitement at the beginning of trips causes most people to subordinate their own preferences to the group s interest , this is likely to change over the course of a vacation .frustration , arguments , and annoyment are only some examples of negative personal conflicts that i saw occuring during group trips in the past .and these can severely ruin the enjoyment of a vacation .based on my experience , tour guides have to the potential to limit the personal freedom to visit attractions that i wanted to see and group dynamics can have a negative impact on all members of the travel group .therefore , i prefer to travel individually .the freedom to create a schedule according to my preferences and to choose who to interact and socialize with during my vacation offsets the extra organizational effort prior to the trip .by travelling individually , the success and enjoyment of my vacation is in my own hands .
