in my opinion , i agree with the statement that said most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my passage i am going to explain why i agree with this statement .also , i am going to explain why some companies do this kind of advertisements .i accept this idea because i saw many kind of advertisments that makes the prodoucts better than real .they are dozen of reasons that make the companies make this kind of advertisment .but in my opinion i think the main reason is the compititon spirit between companies .this spirit make the companies try to interduce thier products as a best product in the market , and some time those companies do nt have the quality to produce this product then they have to produce an advertisment make customers think this product or this offer is the best choise , but in real this is wrong and the advertisment makes the customer chiose this option .in conclusion , the advertisments is an industry and companies use this industry to show thier products in the best way , even if this product does nt have the quality .
