the importance of try new things must not be underated .the reserch of new things is the most important explanation for many characteristics of people .i must say , concerning this , that the great increase in number of new things and uncontrolled development of new subject and new field has not helped the person .modern techiniques , present philosophy of life and the way of thinking have reduced the simple things to obstacle for development of personality and intelligence of a person .but this way of thinking is very ancient ; it goes back to latins and to etrurians .unfortunately the stress of reserch always new activity consumes the people ; relax of people run serious risks because modern man .work and new activity remains an important factors ; they are a things that serves not only , for earning honestly money , but they also give another meaning to existence .this is dignifild and respected activity .but this way of thinking is not always a pleasure , but it is a duty .this because the work is not done with passion , but for acquire more power .i believe that when an activity is well chosen and liked , it becomes an important factor for development of personality of a person .but , between people and people s dreams there has always been a sort of war .this because , an example , since work is done by machine , this mens that the man works less ; but this also means that unemployment increase .when a society becomes industrialized and tecnological , the work it produces no longer needs man .in fact where a machine is installed , a man is dismissed .i believe that today who seek always new things form an important part of society .the reserch of new way of do , means joy , happiness and true affection towards the world .giving to world , without expected anything in return , means seek new tecnology and new way of thinking .above all , marking people understand , that live without discovery is uselessness .to eliminate sadness of world seems really impossible .in fact in the life of man anything is only a pleasure .
