i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities resently .these days , many young people do not care about their communities and even they do not know what is happenning in their comunities .i have some experiences which made me feel that some of young people do not care about their comunities .it was a few weeks ago that we have the day to collect trash in my community .i paticipated in it with my friend .we were gathered at a park .can you imagin how many young people came to the park ?there are only five youg people including me and my friend .later , i asked some of my friends why they did not come .they said that they did nt have time because they was hanging out with their friends or watching tv at their home .some of them even did nt know about it .i was surprised at these reasons since i did nt realize that so many people do not care about the comminuty .also , last year , i was asked to help a festival which was held in my community but i could nt help because i had some things had to do , so i asked some of my friends to help it instead me .however , nobady accepted to do it because they may get tired .as a result , i help the festival .i think there are some problems caused by actions of those who do not give enough time to helping their communities .if more young people help their community , we can make community more great and good for all of us .
