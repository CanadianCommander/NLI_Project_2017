the statment is really general and i disagree with that .i think the category of young people should be divided in different groups .surely the first division should be of two big groups : teens and young people from 20 to 26 .teens should go on studying becouse , as we now , their help to their communitie will be bigger if they can do some usefull work .but at the same time i think , in that period , a teen must hold a part of the day for his couriosity .people from 20 to 26 , that is the category in which i am , could yet be a worker on could still be a student .and i think in both of the situations they are helping their communitie .obviously there could be some exceptions of people that , for different reasons , do nt found their own way .but they are exeptions .than , in italy , we can decide to give social services to society , also stopping to study for a year , and work in hospitals or old people s houses or something similar .but i always think the better way to help your communities it is to find your own position as worker inside the system .and to do that young people must do what they do .what sould they be supposed to do more ?i really would like to understand becouse i read statements like this from when i was child .i think that the past world wars did private young people of their youth .and i think that s not right .so when i realize that i m living in a really beatiful time and in a really comfortable place i think that is a must of mine going on to study , improve my work and enjoy my self .and when i do all of this things i think i m helping my communitie .
