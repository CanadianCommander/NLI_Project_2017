from school to the labor world , hu ; an people have many occasions to learn and learn more .then , people take time to continue discovering things , like science , technology , geography , culture . ..all around us is there an occasion of learning more .some people prefers learning about only one thing : languages , movies , history and so on and closing their eyes on the rest of the world .is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?that s the question . ..academic subjects are related with general knowledge : from what we learned at school to the latest news on tv , we will be able to discuss about the fact of a problem .as mr wilde said [ if i well remember ] , there are 3 kinds of people : those who speaks about people , other who talks about facts , and finally people who discuss the ideas .the specialized person is able to speak , to explain the birth of the problem , the facts , the risks , the advantages and the drawbacks .but his capacity to know and to speak will be limited to some specific subjects .otherwise , having academic knowledge is something long : there are a lot of things to learn , from stranger languages to finance , between musicology and archeology .is it really possible ?knowing everything about a subject is something possible : everybody has a passion and wanted to know the most of things about this topic .a musician want to improve his science by hearing music , learning to define the styles , to increase the technic and will automatically become specialized in this subject .and it s the same for a person who likes its job : after maybe 25 years in the same branch , people have experience and specific knowledge .i think that a specific knowledge do not depends on a specifc willing , instead of the knowledge of many academic subjects , which one is the result of a lot of work .
