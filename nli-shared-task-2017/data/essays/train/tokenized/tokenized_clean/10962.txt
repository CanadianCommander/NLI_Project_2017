although some very populated countries such as china or india are going to become modern industrial countries in the next few years , and then increase their demand of cars , i do nt think that the supply will stay as high as today .several reasons support my opinion .first , the pollution issu is an obstacle to an increasing of the car number .even though these countries can produce and build by themselves their own cars , there are more and more laws in order to reduce pollution , including car pollution .second , gaz oil ressources are becoming rare , and some reaserches state that in less than fifty years all of them will be end .besides , the organisation of arabian countries that produce oil ( opep ) stilll put up the price of the baril .then it becomes very expensive to provide oil .so , on the one hand there is the will of many countries in the world of leading a western way of life , which the feeling of liberty that implies car drivng is an important part .but on the other hand it is an order for humanity to reduce global pollution .nevertheless maybe scientists will find new places where oil is avalaible .however the global warmer climate is still a big issu due to car pollution in a part .maybe that is why policies concerning driving license are becoming so strict in western countries . ..anyway , i would conclude by writing that i believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today
