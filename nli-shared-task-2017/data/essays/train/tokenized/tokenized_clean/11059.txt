i agree with the following statement .why the successful peole are success ?because they would love to try the things that never happen before .then they succeed and these new stuff let more and more people interested in it .the ending will be lots of people want to work with you and it will be developed .it s pretty hard to do a known thing .there has already been some people getting knowledge and doing well .in some way , it s hard for you to do it better .because the people , who has already known it , their next step will be to do it better .you just start it .that s not impossible to do it better but it cost time .if you use the time to do some thing new , it s much better to another way .finding some things new is liked a travelling .you can feel many new feeling and get more express that never happened before .then , more and more people will be interested in your travelling and join you .it will be developing .but anyway , there s still some problems .because it s a unknown stuff , no one has experinces before and you must be your alone when you were starting it .it s so difficult that so many people failed .you will face a lot of challenges and fight with them just by yourself .maybe some one will laugh at you or you will lose yourself in the finding way or you will enter to a dark land .yes , it is difficult .also it s the why you succeed .it means you are better that the loser in this way .you are the winner .you are succeed .you will get some honors and prize .but the greatest things you got that is the knowledge and express and how to deal with these challenges .to do it .
