in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?i think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .it is true that cars are significantly important as transportation ways for middle distance , and the middle-distance transportation will become more important because we need communication and transaction with those who live places where are far from the places where we live in .however , for two reasons , i think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the first reason is the increasing of substitutional transportation ways and the second reason is that the long-distance transportation becomes more impotant than the middle-distance transporation .first , it is true that middle-distance transportation becomes more important .however , ways of middle-distance transportation are not only cars .for example , buses are in use for middle-distance transportation .recently , we pay attention to the negative effect of cars on environment because gases which are issued by cars are said to have effects which make the atomosphere warmer .therefore , the movement occurs that we use buses instead of my cars in order to reduce cars which are in use at the same time .when we consider this trend , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .second , although i think that middle-distance transportation becomes more important , long-distance transportation must become more important than middle-distance transportation , since the necessity of long-distance transportation because information technology allows us to find new infomation about the overseas and to encourage us to go abroad .therefore , although middle-distance transportation may become more important , international transportation becomes important than this .and , if international transportation is more importatnt relatively and expenditure by people remains unchanged , people reduces the expenditure for middle-distance , there are fewer cars in use than there are today .for the above two reasons , i think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , this does not imply that cars are less important than today ; i mean that long-distance transportation is by far more important than middle-distance transportation and ways for middle-distance transportation change .
