i strongly believe that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is far more beneficial than the narrow view on specific subject .there are several important reasons which undergird my position .the first one is that the world is being complicated and interdisciplinary .in other words , it is impossible to understand where the world is heading without the compound analysis on the various subjects .the good example for this is bioengineeing .in these days , the field of study , bioengineering , is getting more popular .and its property can be defined as diversity and integrity of other various fields of the study .it can be referred as a mountain , which is living and breathing .all fields of engineering and science , such as mechanical engineering or biology , chemistry , gets together building mountain , bioengineering .inside it , the each fields interacts and synchronize with each other .without the ability which can have himself or herself understand other fields of study , they can not participate in the interaction among fields and the living mountain can not live anymore resulting in the collapse both personally and socially .the second one is that broad knowledge on many academic subjects affects the individual life directly .for example , if someone knows well about english with mechanical engineering major , he can teach others english as a part time job .also , the person who has broad band of knowledge on academic subjects can do things then others who do nt .someone with qualified foreign language can make connection between his or her company with others abroad .the specialzed knowledge on one subject can make researcher deep well of study .however , the depth of the well can be further by broader entrance of it .the wider the entrance , the deeper the well goes .to get their own major is , of course , important .however , we should remember that broader knowledge can make our research more profounder and valuable .it support strong base for your major .therfore , i prefer to arm with broad knowledge of many academic subfects than to specialize in one specific subject .
