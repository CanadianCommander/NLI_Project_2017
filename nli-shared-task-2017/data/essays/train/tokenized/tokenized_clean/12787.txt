i would agree with the statement that it is necessary for students to unsersatand the basic ideas than merely learning the facts .to exemplify , lets take how an engine works .we may learn many facts about the engine as such or how curiously it works and more .but knowing the facts about the engine doesnt mean that you are conceptualising the basic idea of its mechanism .knowing all the facts doesnot mean that you may be able to repair an engine if it broke down on way .but understading the mechanism and conceptualising how the engine works would help you a lot .just learning facts is only a way of mugging up things .facts always remain as facts and it doesnt mean that students are understanding it .it may teach you right from wrong ones .but if you try to understand the basic ideas you may be able to build your own answers for many questions .students would find this atmost handy while appearing for practical exams .a student who has understood the concept will develop his own answer from a question even if he is asked an indirect or related question .thus you are trying to find out your answer from your own knowledge base which you have conceptualised better rather than merely knowing the fact .but the students may find it difficult to conceptualise things as it is not easy for all to grab things in the same manner .for this , it is better to be more pragmatic than reading through books .it would be better for the students to picturise the mechanism and do it practically .to quote another example , it is a fact that aeroplanes fly with the help of pressure differences on its wings .but merely knowing this fact is not sufficient enough .if you try to understand the idea that an increased velocity of airflow through its wings will create lesser pressure on the surface which gets pushed upwards by the increased pressure at the bottom part , you would conceptualize the idea much faster .if somenoe can show this with a model or a picture , the students woul understand it better .students who have poor ideas or concepts finds themself difficult to get updated with latest innovations and techniques about those subjects .so understanding the ideas and concepts holds the key for effective learning and success .
