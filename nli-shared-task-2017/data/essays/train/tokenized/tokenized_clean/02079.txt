i do not agree that the best way to tarvel is in a group led by a tour guide .i can agree that it can be good but in my opinion it is not the best wayi would like to give an example from my own life in order to illustrate why i do not agree .before i came to new york , i was in madrid in order to get masters degree in law .when i was in madrid , i did not have so many oppotunity to work as a student .for this reason , i used to work as a translator or an assistance for a tour guide .many times i attended many tours with tour guides to help them .last year at this time , one big group which consists of more than 35 people came from turkey and the travel aggent wanted me to help the tour guide and i helped .i was together with this group for almost 8 full days .as far as i could understand from their behaviors and opinions , all of them were much more different than each other .i would like to give an example from one of our activities such as visiting the museum of prado which is one of the most famous musuems all over the world .while some of them wanted to visit there , a few of them did not .like this example , there were so many conflicts among people who came for this travel , in addition because the tour guide got angry with them , he was travellling by himself and he did not want to help anyone during the tour .because of him , i had to help them as i was a tour guide even though i was there just to help this guy .as long as i was in madrid , i faced so many events like this while i was working as an assitance of a tour guide .if there are so many people such as more than 10 people in the group , as far as i know and have an experience , to satisfy all people is getting difficult .in my opinion , when all people who attend these kinds of travels know each other , we can consider that one of the best ways to travel in a group but if they do not know each other , i can not say the same thing .for all these reasons , it can be summuarized the trip or travel can be best way when you travel in a group , if you know with whom you are going to travel .
