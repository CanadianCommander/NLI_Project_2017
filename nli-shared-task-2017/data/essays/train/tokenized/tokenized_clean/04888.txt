unfortunatly this world is affected by a new hill called marketing : capitalism and its consequences had created an imperfect economy situation where industries need to change consumer s will using the new methods of propaganda as media .so the phrase `` products that seem much better than they are  is an hillusive assertion because we really do nt know what we are buying , eating and always thinking .so i surely agree with the statement but i think is not usefull to complain about a situation if you do nt work to change it .the real conditions of many products are hiding to the consumers : we can find many example , from medicines to energy drink . .but i think is the same in fact even though mcdonald s products are labeled on theyre nutritional value , pepople continue in the same way .so probably the only thing to say is that we are all blind !the matter is about imperfection of market and information : with a basic economical study everyone can understand that there s no needing of marketing for the right process of production and distribution of things .in fact the problem born because of the presence of oligopolistic company needing bad device to sell theyre products on an highest price .i think that almost foods have to be cheked with much attention : the true cause of all the sikness of our time { like cancer and so on . .} .although the modern century give to human population times of brightness , from the other side we are bound in a circle in wich { thanks to television and the million of spots every time . .} other tell us what we must desire .in my opinion an implicit { but with our avaliable information explicit !} attempt to our will .
