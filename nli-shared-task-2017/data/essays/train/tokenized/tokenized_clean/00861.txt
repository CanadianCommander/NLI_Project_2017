obviously , it ca nt be denied that most advertisements try to insist on the qualities of the advertised product , and cautiously hides their dark side .as a result , the consummers , who are the targets of the advertisement , may think that the qualities of the product are better than they are actually .the very first reason supporting my point of view would be that i can barely imagine another goal for advertising than highlighting the qualities of the presented products .and to do so , magnifying the greatness of your production is an appropriate way .for instance , i can remember an advertisement for a washing powder which pretended to make your clothes ` whiter than whiter  .that may sound a little bit ridiculous , but that s part of the deal as far as we talk about advertising .another reason explaining that behaviour can , most probably , be found in the growing competition on consumer-goods markets .the marketing theory teaches us that if you want to overcome your opponents , you have to choose between two strategies : you can either improve your product , or you can advertise it in the proper way .for some categories of products , only that last strategy is available : for example , as computers from various brands are all made with the same components , one of the only ways to distinguish yourself is to advertise your production properly .but , on second thought , we may challenge our position in some ways as it is to be noticed that , on some occasions , advertisements does nt make products better than they are in real .first , the law generally prohibit advertisements that would purely and merely lie about the properties of the good you sell .this limitates greatly the possibilities for advertisement to make products better on screen than in real life .second , you ca nt exclude the possibility of having such a great product that it would be totally useless to exaggerate its faculties in an advertisement .finally , and that may sound paradoxical , some adverstisements seem to minimize the presented products .the idea is to tease the consumer who is surprised because of such a strange message .we can quote the example of the british car brand bleinheim which present their luxury cars in a pretty poor way .
