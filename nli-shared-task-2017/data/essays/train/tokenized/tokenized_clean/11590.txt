humanbeings are created with many abilities in order to live more confident in the world even if there are difficulties for them .one of the essential period of humans is when a person becomes a student .although it is believed that understanding ideas and concepts such as theoratical speakings and generalizing common subject are more important than learning the facts for students , i do not share the same idea becuse it is not the ideas that students really live with in all aspects of their lives .firstly , ideas and concept of a certain subject emphazises student that they have to know of a manner only in the knowledge base .however , knowing a subject in the view of theoratical issue does not provide a student enough succession in his/her entire life .ideas and concept are useful for background education .since it is difficult to change or disobey the rules that are gained by ideas and concepts , it forces student look in a narrow view to the knowlege .in contradiction , the ideas and concept can be gained by learning the facts .for example , if a student works on a project which is about an experiment of chemistry , student can learn much easier by practically doing the experiment rather than reading the ideas and the concepts of the experiment from the book .reading only gives a background for the experiment and predicts what happens in that experiment theoratically .hence , learning the facts are superior than gaining ideas and concepts .in conlusion , since gaining idaeas and the concepts for the students can be only theoratical and not predictive , learning the facts directly are much important for a student in his / her education .
