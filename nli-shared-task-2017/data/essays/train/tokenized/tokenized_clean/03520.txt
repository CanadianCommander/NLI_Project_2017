the main purpose of advertising and commercials is to sell and increase the profits of a specific company .in order to maximize their profits , companies are willing to do almost anything , including giving out false information .for many years , the cigarette was seen as a good product that was nt really harmful but provided social advantages .many examples can support the same idea , for example , we see a lot of advartisements today about clothing or beauty products .in these commercials , models are used to represent beauty and to give an idea of how people should look like .unfortunatly , not everyone is as slim and tall as a model and people start thinking that they should be conform to  the look  to be socially accepted .therefore , advertisments often give wrong ideas to the public by forcing them to act in a certain way .because of the competitivity of products on the market , commercials have to make their product seem the best and will often give illusions of being  magical  .this can apply to the cleaning products specially : they make us beleive that they are strong enough to vanish any stain .according to my personal experience , they do nt really work that way !sometimes , advertisements can reach the point of being dangerous , specially when bieng seen by children ; they can have the same effects as violant movies because children ca nt distinguish between reality and fiction and they do nt understand the concept of especial effects .eventhough most of the advertisements make products look better than they really do , we ca nt say the same about all the advertisements because some companies are obliged to give away true information or else they will have serious legislative problems .for example , advertisements for medical treatements and other products that can put people in physical dangers .in conclusion .we should nt always trust the media , and we should be verry careful in
