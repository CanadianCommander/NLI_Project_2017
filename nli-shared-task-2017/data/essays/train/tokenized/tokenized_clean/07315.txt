when it comes to the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  , i always think of my father s childhood .comparing the society when my father was a child and today s society , i get a feeling that young people in nowadays are too busy with their own works and i often expereince the coldness of people , thesedays .in my father s childhood , people were not pressured by time .he tells me that there were more chances to clean his town and to help old people who were living soley .however , in our modern society , you can always see young people watching their clocks and running around with a number of heavy bags .people in today s world , are working when they should be helping their communities .my father often reminds me that there were nothing more important than family and neighbour when he was a child .if one of his neighbours was getting married , all people in his town came to his wedding to celebrate , even the students and the school teachers !but now , young people do not even have time to celebrate his or her own birthdays .therefore , when it comes for young people to help or celebrate other people , they are not so willingful because they hardly ever received these kind of warmness before .due to the rapid change of the society , young people have a loads of work to do in stead of helping their communities and young people are losing their friendness when they should be socializing with people in their communities .may be , it is the time for young people to be relaxed and have a look around them .
