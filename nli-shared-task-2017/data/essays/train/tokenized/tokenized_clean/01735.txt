i disagree with the statement .i think that young people nowadays should give enough time to helping their comunities .there are a couple of reasons i think this way .let me tell you each reason one by one .first , if young people have chanses to help their communities , they can communicate with a variety of people having different social status and being different ages .young people , especially students , tend to be together with people of same generation .through communication with people in their communities , they can develop their ability of sociality .moreover , elder peeple would teach them their communities traditions .accepting their traditions are very important things for young people .and , in the future , they should pass their traditions to next genarations .second , if young people give enough time to helping their communities , they can have oppotunities to donate in their communities .larning donation is important for young people .young people have to learn ideas of cooperation .also , they have to know well not only their school life and their work life , but also a lot of thing in their communitis .thus , these are reasons why i think that young people should give enough time to helping their comunities .
