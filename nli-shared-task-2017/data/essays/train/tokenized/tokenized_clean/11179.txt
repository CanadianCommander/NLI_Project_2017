there are controversy about importance between having a broad knoeledge of many academic subject and a specific subjcet .as a matter of fact , i am following the opinion that having a broad knowledge is more important in modern society for two reasons .let me explain more precisely .to begin with , knowing about lot of kind of fileds studies may increase tha ability of communication , which is thr most impotant key in the futuer world .humana have achived a great deal of development in each erasin own filed and that cause the miscommunication to each each other becaus the concpt are now reaaly hard to under stand easily .so , word ` generalist  and appeard instead od ` specialist  contemporary society .by make conncetion in spacial academic fileds they colud play a team work in various projects .furthermore , having a broad information can make a `` sinerge effect  in a specific era .if the knoweldge intergated with others , the benefits are not only double but triples , even increase inormously , and this ih the reason why trem `` sinerge effect.  maked .for that reason , many university is makig a joing coures for their reacherch as a ` inter-displinary  purpose , and thorgh those kind of effort current stuy are gaining a great deal of accomplishments .for exem  mple as a graduate student , i am undergiong that method too .on the whole , broad knoweldge can make more fluent social communications and make each specific subjects more power by connecting .that makes cleare that it s better to choose than a specific subject learing .
