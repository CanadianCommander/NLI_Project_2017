`` you only live once , so live life to the fullest  is a well known saying , echoed across cultures and countries all over the world .people are probably tired of hearing it .it basically means that everyone can enjoy life no matter how old or young they are .and they should .because lost time wo nt be found again .if someone were to say to me that young people enjoy life more than older people , i d have to completely disagree .there are definitely big advantages being an older person .for one , you d probably have your own money to spend and i m pretty sure there s no better feeling than earning your own bread and butter and then going about spending it .for example , there s a strapping young 15 year old lad who likes nothing but to spend his day at the arcade and throw away all his allowance playing a pinball machine .allowance .that s all .now let s take the example of a millionaire who has nt managed to let go of his childish ways .he just bought an arcade ( and an amusement park ) and had a few pinball machines moved to his sprawling 12 bedroom , 14 bathroom mansion .seems like these oldies have all the fun .let s take into account that in most countries you have be over 21 years of age to go bungee jumping .not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would nt be able to .enter electronic media and technology .ever so often we re subjected to watching millionaires and billionaires on television .they always seem so happy .sure they ca nt really ride a skateboard or a bike but they ve managed to replace that with a more than adequate automatic scooter that they just have to stand on .i can imagine them zipping around on their little scooter , looking at kids on skateboards and thinking that they re having way more fun .in fact to some extent , i even think that older people are `` allowed  to have more fun .yes , it s unfair .but such is life .it goes without saying that with age comes responsibility and i think a complete person is one who accepts his age and his responsibilities towards himself and the society he lives in .but that does nt mean the fun comes to an end .it almost never does .bad health , beer bellies and balding are a few deterrents from that life of fun , fun , fun .but then again , you only live once and older people know that better than anyone .they re trying to get as much in while they can .i ca nt wait for my days as an old man kicking back in a comfortable chair and watching soccer on the television .the fun never stops .hey , look who just bought a yacht .
