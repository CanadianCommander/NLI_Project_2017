some people might say that for the students it is more crucial to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .however , i ptrfer to choose with the formal since the students are learning their subjects based on facts from the school .firstly , a lot of adults are trying to teach and give them only the right factors without any explanations .for instant , whenever i had learned something from the school i did not understand the parts of ideas and concepts on something but the teachers tought me the facts not the real ideas of the problem .so it was really hard for me to understand of my study and improve my studying skills .also i was not even able to concentrate on the other parts .on the other hand knowing only facts could be easier but unuseful and does not make more sense .in addition , for the learners make them to understand more ideas and concepts are much better and they can feel more security .to sum up , as i said above , in my case telling kids the ideas and concepts are more critical than just let them know the facts .because students have to have their own rights to think about some facts and should able to catch their abilities as well as human s freedom .
