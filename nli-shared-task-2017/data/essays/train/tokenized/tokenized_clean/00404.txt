of course i completly agree with that statement .i think that in life everyone must have high ambitions , but the realization of personal scopes and ambitions dipends in a large part on the ability of everyone to take risks and try new things .if a parson who wants to have success in life only does what he/she already know maybe he never became real leader in his own business .that s because everyone has to wrong for deeply learn .of course if there are no risks there are no mistakes and if there are nt any mistakes nobody can obtain a real knowledge .the real knoledge is based on two fondamental points :personal cultur , academic and theoric knoledge and pratical experience .they are both fondamental : the only theoric knoledge or the only pratical experience are not enough .for example i m a good students , i have good marks and a good theoric knolendge , but if i want to have success in the future this is nt enough .in fact in ten years i see myself graduate but also working in the field i m studying for .i see myself at the head of my own business , i do nt care if small or big , i just hope it could be active in organization of cultural events .i said that becaouse even if i will be graduate with excellent marks it will be very important for my person and my careear to do experiece in the `` concrete world  .in fact i imagine my self travelling around the world , surching for new experiences , and new sources to organise very original a particular events here in italy .this is very important do give relevance to the years that i spent at school at first and and at universty after .this is tha only way to have success in life .
