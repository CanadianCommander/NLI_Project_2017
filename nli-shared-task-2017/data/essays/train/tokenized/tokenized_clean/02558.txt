from birth to death , life is a precious thing that we should enjoy everydays .older people have probably more things to enjoy life such as time , money and experience but i think that young people have more opportunities to do so .these oportunities are for the most important , the youth of their body which can allow them of more activities and the lack of responsabilities .first , most of young people s body are in shape .their muscles and tissues are tight and they have a good breathing .this fact allow them to enjoy outside and inside activities or different sports like tennis , soccer or football who requires a good breathing , muscles in shape and a good endurance .an other example would be the practice of extreme and sometimes dangerous sports such as snowboarding or skyflying , parachute , a young person is more able to do it than an old person who can be scared to break something .all these activities are fun and make you spend a great time , especially with a group of friends .an other significant example is the sexually life in a couple .i know this matter can be difficult to talk about for some people but i think that it s still part of enjoying life , especially if you love your partner .a young person is sexually more active than an old one and it is also part of enjoying life to have a good sexual life .being in shapesecondly , the young people do nt usually have any responsabilities such as children , spouse or important job .they are free of their movement and can live their life as they intend to before they get stuck in a stable situation , when it will be almost impossible to do so .in that case , they are free to enjoy life in the fullest .for example , travelling is a good way to have a great time and learn about different countries and cultures .of course an old person can still travel but they wo nt have the same dynamisn if they are really old or the same freedom if they have a family behind them .for instance , a child can stop you in doing adult activities .to conclude , i think that life is much more enjoyable when you are young for a lot of reasons such as the body s ability , the freedom , friendship and parties .so young people should nt lost time and enjoy life while they can before becoming adults .
