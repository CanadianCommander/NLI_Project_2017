since the start of nineteen century we have been see a general and strategic transformation in the world of transportation .in 1909 , with ford model t , automotive transportation starts a new era .a new industrial mentality of work infulenced our mentality and our every-day life .petroleum sobstitutes foot and cars start to entry in our life .and ambient situations ?it is not important ?in my opinion all we need a personal car to use for our short and long travel .the real problem is another .i think , in fact , that cars , scooter and many others human solutions of urban transportation are not stricltly necessary for our daily life .we can go to work whit tram , autobus , public bus and metro ( where it is ) .in the smallest town we can also use bycicle or foot .yes , why not ?the work time is real problem .business and work gives us stability and a sort of indipendence .work generate many different situations as we kno .however , a personal car generate indipendence and a constant sense of freedom that we often need .in my opinion urban traffic is the constant that we have to destroy .i hope only that technological development gives more clean in our streets .hybrid solutions and hydrogen s applications can take the exit point .engineered informations can save our landscape , but not only .in my opinion ambiental response is in the next future .we have waiting foa a few years and the city is , today , the heart of the civic world .money and clock-time are walking around this .could we imagine another situation ?simply we have to do that .waiting for water fueled cars . ..
