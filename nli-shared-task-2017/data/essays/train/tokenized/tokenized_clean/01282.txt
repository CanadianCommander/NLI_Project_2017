we only live once , and for a quite short period of time .it is possible to divide life into two halfs .the first half is from the birth to the age of fourty , and i am sure you will guess the second one .the descending time follows the ascending time .but is reality so binary ?a proof that young people enjoy life more than older people is that children always laugh .but why are they so happy ?certainly because everything is still possible for them .they are able to run and play football while elders sit in their wheel chair .they learn and improve their skills every single day while it is exactly the opposite for older people .young people are able to love and do not feel concerned by the problems the world faces : they do not even know what tomorrow will be made of !hopefully , older people have other sources of pleasure .above all they have a lot of free time which they can use to do everything they want .they have no reason to doubt about their future , because it is behind them .everything is possible at any age and everyone can bethe most important to enjoy life is to keep young in his head .age does not matter , only what we do with our time down here matters .
