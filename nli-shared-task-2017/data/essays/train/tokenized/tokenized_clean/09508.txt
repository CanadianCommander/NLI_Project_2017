an advertisement is a publicity for an object , a restaurant or food .the company that makes it wants the people who watch the advertisement to go to that specific restaurant or buy that particular object .we will first discuss the principles of advertising and then we will explain our specific opinion about the statement .to begin with , an advertisement is made so that the company that offers the service or the good can sell more of it .therefore , the general idea is to make , for example , the object seem necessary at home , the office or even in the car .to make it so attractive the producer needs to put forward its best qualities which will revolutionise your day to day lifestyle .for example , we can put ourselves in the situation where we need to advertise car perfumes .we will , in a first part , demonstrate that most cars have very bad smells and , then , that once the buyer purchased the car perfume these smells disappeared .the producer will try to limit the fact it might take some time for the perfume to act .but are these principles there to make products seem much better ?in my opinion , i truly believe that `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .taking our last example , the fact that the producer limits , in the advertisement , the perfume s action time is false information .the advertisement will necessarily show that the smell disappeared immediately after the man entered the car with the perfume .of course , there are many examples of this .at mcdonald s , the big macs are nowhere near as perfect as in their commercials .in a general way , most people know that every object will not be exactly like in the commercials .the general population can make the difference between the ad and what the object will be like .eventhough , they do make products seem better than they really are , the only thing that counts is that the difference between reality and the commercial is not extremely large .to conclude , our and our parents  generations have been brought up with advertisements and with the companies  will to lure more customers .therefore , i believe that if some companies `` stretch  the truth about their products , as long as it is not in the extremes , then their advertisements are still ethically correct .
