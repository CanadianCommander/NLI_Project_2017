it has been rightly said ,`` little knowledge is a dangerous thing ,drink deep or taste not the pierian spring ,there small draughts intoxicate the brain ,while drinking largely sobers us again !indeed , i believe that instead of limiting kowledge to small draughts of one subject , it is much more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects just like drinking largely from the pierian spring .if we specialize in one subject , our knowledge is contained only within the narrow boundaries of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lies undiscovered before us .we become ignorant about other impotant things that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intelligence and understanding .by specializing in one subject , we tend to forget that there are millions of other possibilities in store for us , that there is so much knowlege to gain in this world and so little time .with a broad knowledge or several things , we widen our vision and expand our horizons .we realize that we have miles to go before we sleep .broad knowlege enlightens us about the vastness of this universe and makes us aware that even if we spend out entire lifetime gaining knowledge , there will still be thousands of things that we are ignorant about .another important fact is that various aspects of knowledge are related to one another .without being aware of other subjects , knowledge of our own subject becomes constricted and we tend to have a narrow minded approach towards things .moreover , if facts are bricks , accumulation of facts is as much knowledge as a pile of bricks is a house .we need to know what is going on around us to put our knowledge to good use .also , practically speaking , what use is speacialization in one subject in our daily lives ?is a ph .d in microbiology going to help us cope with the obstacles of everyday life ?only awareness of every branch of academics can enable us to practically gain benefits .so , it is my firm opinion that one should try to learn as much as possible in this short life given to us .i , personally , would prefer to be a jack of all trades rather than a master of just one .
