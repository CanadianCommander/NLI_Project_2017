do you have driver s license ?recently , a lot of people get driver s license in japan , especially students .threfore , i think more cars will be sold because more people will get driver s license and higt technology is innovatede .many people tend to think that cars are very convienient to move , so they get to driver s licence .for example , almost all my friends have driver s license and when we travel , we always move by car .we like listen music in a car .in addition , we think cars are convinient because we can go anywhere by only car .if we take trains , we often should walk to our destination .some friends have their own cars and the rest of them work hard to buy cars .therefore , cars are needed by many people .many caompanies of car make many cars to show their high technology .i major in machanical engineering in my university .someday , i went to plants of toyota and nissan to study making cars .the engineers in both toyota and nissan make an effort to create new cars .they want to improve the speed and confortable structure of car , and they are caring of the environment .so , a number of new model cars are showed .alhough i know we have some problem of car such as accident of car and destroying the environment , i think we ca nt get rid of our current life .
