in my opinion it is more important for students to understand concepts than to study or learn the facts pertaining to the subjects .i have experienced a lot of problems in this matter in my childhood days where i usually concentrates more on the facts than ideas and concepts .one such experience occured in my tenth class where i usually learn facts of my subjects such as physics , social , mathematics before exams .by the time , it is ready to write the exam i usually forget most of answers or facts which i learned earlier and get less marks in exam .my friend of mine on the contrary , usually concentrates on ideas and concepts in physics , social subjects and he is able to reproduce successfully what he learned in exams without any trouble .another experience i faced , when i am writing entrance exam for engineering course , where i concentrates more on formulaes and principles related to mathematics and does not concentrate on ideas and concepts .due to tension in the exam i am unable to recall the formulaes what i learned and ended up with low score on the exam .however for undergraduate students it is not necessary to understand ideas and concepts pertaining to their subjects because actually undergraduate course is of four years so it is hard to remeber ideas and concepts for various subjects .instead they must remember only facts except their favourite subject , where they are going to do research in graduate coure .in conclusion one thing can be drawn that students must study ideas and concepts upto intermediate education and not necessary to remember concepts in their undergraduate course .
