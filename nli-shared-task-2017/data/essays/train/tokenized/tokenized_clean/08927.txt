i strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i maintain this stance on this issue since i have various examples that prove that young people give the same , if not more , time to help their communities .firstly , i would like to draw attention to a recent happening in india .the government was on the verge of passing a bill in the parliament that ensured a reservation for the so called `` lower casts  in esteemed institutions of higher studies .there was a hue and cry from all sections of the society but no one actually stepped forward to oppose this move of the government .looking at the views of the majority of the society ( which included minorities ) that reservations divide people , the students of aiims ( a reputed medical college in new delhi ) joined hands to oppose this `` socially detrimental  step .later , this movement culminated into a nation wide student rally that had positive effects with the government finally relenting .the point is that these days the younger generation is more aware of its rights and has a keener sense of what is right and what is wrong than the younger generation ofthe past .secondly , there was a case where some students from the indian institutes of technology who despite having an assured future in the technological fields , shunned their highly paid jobs only to lay the foundations of a political party aimed at the elimination of corruption from the society in india .do such cases show that the younger generation do not care for their communities ?conversely , do they not show an extreme love towards their community ?i say they surely do .besides all these specific cases i have one example from my own life where the children of our city joined hands to prevent the pollution of natural resources .all these children abstain from using motor bikes ( preferring cycles ) and refrain from celebrating indian festivals with crackers since they pollute a lot .they are also involved in spreading an awareness program to protect the lakes of our city ( bhopal , madhya pradesh .india ) .uch acts depict that the younger generation is mature enough to think and feel for the community .if we look around , we have various instances all over the world where the younger generation has really overtaken the ` adult  world in trying to improve our communities .from spreading awareness against diseases to providing free tuition classes and community services in free for all schools , the younger generation has really opened its eyes and is surely aiming at making the earth a better `` community  to live in .
