the young people of today are a much more informed and aware group of people than young people in the past ever were .they are the future of society and community and ofcourse have a big role to play in giving back to and helping their communities .it is unfair to say that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .i am of the opinion that young people nowadays give as much if not more time than the youth of years gone by ever did to helping their communities .the youth of today having had more oppurtunities than youth of yester years ever did have benefited greatly from the same .there are several examples from recent years that go on to prove how young people have devoted a lot of their time and energy towards forwarding a cause that is related to their communities .as a particular example , one may look at the anti firecracker drives undertaken by young people across several regions during festive seasons .such campaigns are aimed at issues ranging from reducing the pollution levels experienced due to bursting of firecrackers to more grave topics such as tackling child labour ( often being emplyed in fire cracker factories ) .however , some may argue that as a movement such anti-firecracker drives may be instigated not by young people themeselves ; but the fact remains that such drives are successfull only due to the active participation and support of young people .and we have sufficient evidence to belive that these movements are more successful today than they ever were in the past .another example is that of community service programs initiated in several private schools over the past few years .it is now compulsory in several schools to complete a certain number of community service hours .what is most heartening is that i myself have experienced first hand how many students are interested in devoting more time than is compulsarily required of them .a myriad of social service clubs have formed in schools .in my own school , such a club was in the nascent stages when i graduated .once again , cynics may argue it is not the youth themselves who are jumping in on community service ; but the bottomline is that the average school going student today probably spends a lot more time in community service than a student did ten or twenty years ago .one arguement that must be put forth to make the case for the young people today even stronger is the current state of growth and development of communities in different regions .barring a few exceptions , the standard of living of people has gone up over time and therefore so has the standard of the community that houses these people .in my opinion , it is not possible to explain such an improvement in community life without giving some credit to the young people of the community .even if the younger people may not be at the helm of organising community get-togethers and events , they are most often the ones that participate heartily in the same .such active participation definately goes to help their communities develop .
