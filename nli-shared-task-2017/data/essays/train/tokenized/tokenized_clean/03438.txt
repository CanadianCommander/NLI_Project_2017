if always watching the tv , you must see many different kind of advertisement .but most of them are not that true .i have heard someone said most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , i totally agree this statement , here is some examples for me to support this statement is correct .all producers must want consumers choose their products while consumers are comparing the product towards other substitutes .that is the main point why advertisement should make products seem much better than they are .in fact , their aim is to earn money .for example , substitutes like fast food shops mcdonald and burger king , papa johns and pizza hut and so on .even films or tv shows , they still only promote the best and the most excited part to audiences .indeed , that is normal but this is the main point that they did make the products seem much better .i had an experience about a film .watching the advertisement about a horror film through tv , the film was really exciting and the plot seems really attractive and scary , and so i paid and watched the film in a theatre .however , that is an undoubtedlly bored movie i have seen .the most frightened and excited you could all know from the tv .the advertisement really make the product so nice .another bad experince is i read a advertisement through magazine which is about a hotel .the pictures inside were so grand and the food or rooms are nice .but , when i finally arrived there , i found that the rooms were dirty and those food are aweful .then i complained to the manager , but his attitute was bad and arrogant .the result i had received which is far away form that advertisement which shown in magazine .i was extremely disappointed with that advertisement which make their product seem better .in conclusion , actually the advertisements are not 100 percent true , we should pay attention when we decide to buy it or not , and do not just believe the advisetisment .therefore , as i said i totally agree with that statement which is totally correct .
