i agree with the statement , that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .industries only want to sell their products .especially in tv advertisments the marketing directors of a company only want to show , how positive the product is and that everybody needs it at home .first of all , companys want to sell .they want to earn money .that is why they exist .what people really need is not nescessary for them .they only want custumers to buy their own products .the second point is , that tv ads only show how positive a product is .negative things , like high rated prizes are often not in the advertisments .companies onlzx show how positiv a product is .thez also sell dreams .for example : ten naked girls running on a beach on a boy , who looks ugly and has the product in his hands .today that is a normal tv spot .with the product of this specific company the ugly guy will get one of the girls for a date .the advertisment will tell me that , but that is just not the truth .companies want to sell dreams , which have nothing to do with the truth .marketing directors of companies also wants the customer to tell , that there is a product what they really need at home and for themselves .everthing in advertisments is positive .faced by this fact , it shows that the products in tv spots should be better than they are in reality .the reality do not exist in advertisments .that is a fact .all that reasons are important for me , why i agree with the statement , that advertisments make prducts seem much better than they really are .somebody who disagree has no idea about companies and their tricks to sell the highest numbers of products , which are possible .
