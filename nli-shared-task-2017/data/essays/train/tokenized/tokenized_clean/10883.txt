some people believe that successful people sould try new things and take risks .others do nt .personally , i ca nt totally agree with both .for one reason , successful people should face new things to be more skillful and adept .moreover , they ca nt have the same routine evryday .on the other hand , they should focus on what they are good at to enhance and improve their ambitions and dreams .for the second reason , i find it delightful and glamorous to take risks specially for successful people .because they have to be astute and wise and that will appeal by collecting data by having a new experince and a new risk .for the third reason , sometimes they shouldnt take damage risks .for example , i once heared that their was a wise successful person who went to the tropical forests to take a new hazard .unfortunatly , he ended up dead .so vividly , their are limits by having risks .moreover i think it is compulsory to know them .for the forth reason , sometimes successful people should pursue their happiness .because i find it outstanding to congregate and gather by having new risks .plus it may lead you to your own ambition .for example , i was out once with family and friends i was scared of sky diving but they forced me to play it and i intrestingly i ve liked it alot .moreover , i play ski diving evry month now .eventually , i think trying new things has an amaizing features amaizing .however , successful people should focus on the things that they know how to do well too .
