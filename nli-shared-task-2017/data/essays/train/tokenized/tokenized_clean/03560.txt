every person is given a meaning to his existence because of the community he lives in and henice its his moral responsibility to show gratitude towards the comunity he is a part of .he needs to help his fellow community members in whatever the extent he can .young people nowadays may not be as responsible as the youth of the previous generation in certain factors .but this can not be attributed to their work towards community .youth are as dedicated towards the development of community as the youth once were .i would strongly disprove the statement that young people are not giving enough time towards helping their communities .we can find lot of young girls and boys volunteering during weekends at various temples , churches and mosques .during festivals/celebrations , we find lot of community events organised .the interesting factor in these is , young people are the organisers of these events .they involve in the pooling of the funds , gathering the necessary equipment and hold on till the smooth transition of events is complete .they are present everywhere .they are not doing these for some petty monetary allowance .its being done as a token of respect for the community they live in and the people part of it .when all these are happening right in front of our eyes , how can we state that they are showing a deaf ear to their community .these are few examples of the services exhibited by the young people towards the upliftment of their community .though not in a direct form , we can find young people working in various companies and colleges doing social service on few particular days commemorating some important occasion .also , most of the young people after passing out from their college and joining some industry/company , do come back to college occassionally .they help their junior students by taking some guidance classes , clear their doubts about the job culture and industrial environment .they even help their alma mater by donating funds as a responsible alumnus and are supporting the community they are part of .we also find many young people participating in the preservation of environment campaigns .they are raising their voice with the help of associations like `` save earth  , `` green peace foundation  etc .most of the members in these organisations are people aged under 30 .they are preaching for a better earth and thus are striving to help the community they live in .in short , i would strongly disagree with the given statement and reinforce that youth s commitment towards the community has not changed over generations .
