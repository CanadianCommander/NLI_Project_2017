what is going to happen twenty years later , can not be predicted accurately by anyone .the use of cars will decline or increase depends a lot on the success of the contemporay researchers success , who are curently working diligently on finding an alternate renewable and cheap source of energy , which may help power the engines of the future automobiles .if we do not find a replacement for gasoline as a fuel for driving the cars engines , this exhaustable fuel source will some day deplete .in the situation of reducing supply of the fuel for the car , the prices of the oil will increase , making it less afordable .the car companies may initially decrease the prices of their automobiles to lure the customers harrowed by the increasing oil prices .this price decrease may not last long , since the car companies will realise later that it is more sensible to sell high priced cars to a few people and gain a higher profit by working less , rather than making more cars to gain the same or may be even lower profits .hence the number of cars on road may decrease .furthermore as the world economies grow more , the governments of the world would try to improve the public transport systems , and recomend to their citizens to favour it over the use of private vehichles .the litreacy rate is also bound to increase with time .hence the literate and more sensible citizens would readily take the advise of the governments and start favouring public transport .this would again decrease the number of cars .if a new renewable and cheap fuel source is invented , initially the automobile industry may suffer due to the technological changes that it may have to adopt but , eventually this may bring about a boom in the automobile industry .people would be interested in trying the new technology , and hence try to adopt it .cheap and non poluting fuel may make people want to own their own private vehicles .the government will try to subsidise this new fuel to wean off its citizens from the use of gasoline .such moves will make people want more cars and hence the numbers of the cars on road may increase .the growing population of the world is producing more consumers , hence the number of cars in the given circumstances are bound to increase .hence in conclusion i would like to say that the question of weather of not the number of cars in the future is goin to decline can not be answered instantly .it depends on the developments in science in the near future .
