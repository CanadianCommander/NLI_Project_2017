everybody wants to study in good college and university .in student life it is very improtant to choose a intersting field while learning .and the university and collge helps the student for making his decision correct .in college life there are so many light moments and idea s we share with the classmates while discussing about the topic .a good institution provide a good platform for the student to flourish his desire in the perticular field in which he want s to study .a good authority provide him good depth of knowledge .as we know that learning by doing and seeing on beliving are the two major aspects of life .the students go through the prectial and learn the prectical aspects of the matter .also he goes to he libtrary and go through the big tome and get knowledge but when he do the practical it become more clear to the student .we can take an example like the student of biology who want s to learn about the nervous system of the rabbit .he goes through many books but ca nt get the exact idea , but when he dissect out the object in the lab he got the idea that what he had studied .and a architecture ca nt understant the subject until he do nt make the model or goes through the practicals .we can take so many example from the various fields of the courses .but the basic thing is the students should get the exact information and their concept should be clear .so i agree with the given statement that `` it is more important for the student s to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .because if his concepts are clear about the topic he will be more clear about the topic or in materialistic era if somebody has very good knowledge he will get very good job , recognition , and fame .
