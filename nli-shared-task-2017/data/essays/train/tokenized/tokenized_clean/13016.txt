i disagree with the statement .i strongly think that the number of cars in use wil increase in 20 years .there are several reasons to support my popnion .one of them is the remarkable increase in population over the world , especially in china .because of the growth of economy in the developing countries , more and more people there are becoming rich , and they tend to seek for modern or convenient life .having a car is one of the most outstanding symbols for people to realize that the standard of their living are improved .therefore , a larger number of cars will be purchaesd in those countries .there may be a strong negative opinion to what i mentioned above because environmental issues caused by fossil fuels that are consumed by cars are getting more and more serious .in addition , the recent price upsurge of petroleum might be a great infuence on the car usage .however , i do not think they will be a big problem .nowadays , new technology is being pu into our use to solve the problems of environment or energy security in the future .one of those technologies is fuel cell .fuel cells can produce enrgy from hydrogen without emitting green house gas .even though it is useless if hydrogen is obtained by burning fossil fuels , that van bve produced by nuclear power stations .also , thanks to introduction of electronic vehicles , we will not need to use fossils fuels to move cars in the future .therefore , i am confidrnt that the number of cars in use increase inthe
