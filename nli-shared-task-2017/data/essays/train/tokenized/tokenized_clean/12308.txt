in order to contextualize an specific academic subject , there has to be a broad knoledge of many academic subjects .the balance between the general knowledge one gains and the specific knowledge one pretends to obtain is an important one .both knowledges are co-dependant and inter-related with each other .in my personal academic experience , i could say that the general knowledge in the hummanities department , the physical education department , the antrhopology department and the social sciences department has led to a more profound and mature understanding of my specific field of study .my undergraduate proposal was to combine all these fields in the performance arts , thus enhancing the possibility of a more organic and interdisciplinary approach to them .by combining physical training ( in theatre arts and physical education classes ) with physcology , anthropology and humannities classes , one can achieve a more integral view of the human being within it  s context .by expanding knowledge into various fields , the being can enhance theatrical and creative performance in a self-concious way .the body can therefore express it  s integration in society by developing a language that articulates racial , academic and social background .in other words , the body becomes a didactic space that expresses it  s knowledge and transmits it to it  s public .the spartans believed that a healthy mind in a healthy body is what made an integral citizen .my undergraduate program reiterates this position and expands it by incorporating the body in the `` wholeness  of academic development .if one wants to be an instrument of knowledge for it  s society , then one has to acquire a certain general knoledge of all academic fields , in order to transmit a concient and integral discourse to society .my specific knowledge field , performance arts , is a great tool to transmit this discourse , using the body as a `` connector  with it  s society .
