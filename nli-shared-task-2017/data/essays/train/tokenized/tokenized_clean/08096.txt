personally i strongly disagree with the idea that successful people try new things or are risky people .mistakenly since the beginning of the century , it has been believed that the reasons for success of some people who had started large companies were that they had introduced new concepts doing something different , and had taken risks .on the other hand , i believe that the reason for success are hard work , motivation and imagination .first i think that hard work usually fosters success .for example athlets are clear examples .the more and the harder they train , the better results they get .it is clear that athlets that get first positions in swimming races are not just risk people .furthermore in academics or labor enviroument , the continuous effort is a valued factor .for instance novel prizes are awared for work along several years and not just for one isolated paper or idea .in the second place , imagination ( and not just trying something new ) is crucial for success ( which is reaching a goal ) .some people who we consider successful such as thomas edison , or albet einstain , were people with a huge imagination , and therefore they were able to introduce innovations or new theories .finally , motivation is the main factor for success .even if a person has the skill , the discipline and imagination , if s/he is not motivated nothing will show up .motivation is the willingness or the reaons for reaching a goal .for example several history acadamics explain that successfull people as athlets , business men , or scientist usually are inspired in a fact as solving a problem , illness , or to honor their parents , etc .consequently agreeing that success in only related to people who are just risky or just try new things , will only capture a narrow view of sources success .success depend on deeper and wider things that the two thing named in the prompt .
