i absolutly agree with the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for several reasons :first , our everyday actions are not based on facts we learned by heart but on ideas we understood .an easy example is the action crossing the street , i look to the right and to the left to ensure that there is no car on the street , because i understand that it is dangerous to walk through a street with driving cars on it since they would drive over me .if i only had learned it by heart i would have crossed a street with driving cars on it and so i would nt be here doing the toefl .second , you can only solve a problem if you understand the problem .you will never come to a appropriate solution of a problem just learning some facts .an example herefore is a mathematic task : although you might have learned all relevant facts for a test you will face problems when the tasks derives from the standard tasks you have practiced in your math lessons .third , the recency factor of ideas you understood once is much higher than this of learned facts .i still know how to calculate the volume of a cube but i do nt know all capital cities anymore .the reason for this phenomen is easy : i learned calculating the volume through logicall thinking and not through simply learning facts .all together for me it is proven that ideas you understood ones will help you your whole live in different situations , let it be in lessure time or in business , but facts you learned by heart , will be forgotten as soon as the test has been written .
