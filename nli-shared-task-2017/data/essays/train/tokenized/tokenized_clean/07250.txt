it is reasnoble to me that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , idea and cocepts make a new fact in future .why do student study ?i think that studying stand for making new things in future .if we learn facts , we will be able to only regrect or stop the failure and repeat success .facts can not make a birth new idea and concepts .but idea and conepts can make unlimited new facts .second , fact is sometimes sad thing for student .students have tremendous possibility to make new ideas and concept for facts .young student is very sensitive about emotinal matter which happend in the real world .bad fact sometimes affect for young student .because young student has big curious .they wanna make sure the fact is true or not .third , facts sometimes easily make misunderstanding of to stand for the fact .if we learned only facts , we ca nt understand the idea and concepts of the facts .for example , human being have made a lot of sad war in our history .it is fact and we need to accept it as real and understand the reason which it s happend in order to not make failure again .the important thig of war is not fact .it is the process contain idea and concept .we ca nt learn anything to stop failure repeated from only fact .in the worth , fact make a lot of misunderstandig that war can make it solution .thus i recommend that young students should understand ideas and concepts before to leran facts .
