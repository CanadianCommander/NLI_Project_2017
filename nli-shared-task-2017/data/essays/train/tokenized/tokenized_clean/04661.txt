one of the main reasons why i dislike the italian scholastic system is that teachers pay more attention to illustrate the cronological sequence of historical facts to their students rather than to discuss what there is behind these events .therefore if i were asked to answer the question : `` is it more important for students to understand concepts and ideas rather than to learn facts ?i would say `` yes  .i sincerely believe taht students should concentrate their attention more on the ideas that form the basis of the events rather than on the events themselves .in this essay i will illustrate my point .first , i sincerely believe that there is no point in learning facts , dates , and names by heart .obviously , everyone should know when some important events ( such as the world wars , the american or french revolutions ) have happened but what we really have to care about is why they happened and what kind of consequences they have had for us .only if do we answer these questions we will be able to understand ho we are and to learn from past mistakes .second , it has been claimed that we tend to forget dates and names more quickly than concepts .as a result , i think that it is no good forcing to force our mind to remember things that we are bound to forget in a very short run .third , learning facts might turn out useful to get a good grade at school but it will not have any positive practical implications .what we have to know to keep up with times is the ideology that every period is based on .to sum up , i think that it is more advantageous for everyone of us to learn concepts and ideas rather facts since it can help us to achieve the full consciousness o
