let me begin by stating that during your studies at university , for instance in economics , you will get courses , which contain a lot of theoretical content and it s hard to understand and remember all those different theories from famous scientists or managers etc. for your final exams .the first fact to mention is that , if you understand those difficult theories of what your lecturer is telling you during a course , it will be much easier to remember it for learning for your final exams at the end of the semester .certainly , you can recap during the last preparation days by using your scripts and papers and keep it in mind .but does this garantee that you pass the exam .propably not , because it is typical that you get asked about the realtions between different theories .when you have understood , what the main theory is about you can easily answer such questions .but there is also a point against this opinion .there are always course contents , which are not understandable .i know , this sounds unusual .but for example in maths , there are formulas for which you would need days to get it , how they were developed .but if you learn them by heart , you can simply use them in different types of excercises .in this case , it would be very intensive to understand it , whereas you can simply adopt it on several issues .besides that , there is another arguement for understanding , instead of just learning these facts .if you understand all this comlicated theorical content of a model you need to know , it will be much easier to use them in your later life .for instance when you get a job in a research company , you can simply use your knowledge to fullfill your tasks , you are supposed to do .another example would be a other course , in which you are talking about things that are familiar to this special model you have completely understand and in mind .then you can use your knowledge to understand the next topic .you can say , that you incerase your knowledge by using your old knowledge .in conclusion , i certainly can say that i support this opinion and always have thought the same way like the person , who has said this .because if you learn something by heart , i m 99.99 percent sure that you will have forgot it completely a week after the exam and as i already mentioned , if you understand the main content of a theory you can manke use of it in every case you have to and you also do nt have to learn it that much ( maybe you do nt have to ) , because you will have it already in mind .
