advertisements make products seem better than they really are .yes that is true .advertisements are meant for selling the product faster and for commercialization of the product .to achieve this goal advertisers create a hype regarding the product .there are many varieties of the same product , for example many cereals have the same basic ingredients but some are sold like hot cakes while others do not .the products which are advertised more happen to to be sold faster than those that are not advertised .mmany cereals advertise that cholesterol would reduce to half by eating the cereal or the calcium in the cereal would improve their bones .these are not always true .in my experience i found that eating cereals which advertise that cholesterol is reduced to half or the calcium in the cereal makes bones grow stronger is just to attract the society to buy the cereal .the advertising personnel try to attract the customer by health logos and slim waist line advertisements to sell the product .when my doctor told me that i should reduce my cholesterol in take i started eating a cereal to bring down my cholesterol for six months .after six months my cholesterol level was still the same .my friend once bought a weight reducing drink being carried away by the advertisement which said reduce weight in three months .she took the drink as specified but she did not reduce weight .not only that the side effects with the drink outweighed the little benefit the drink provided .these specific examples made to believe that most advertisements are just for marketig sake and just make seem the prodct is reaaly better than it really is
