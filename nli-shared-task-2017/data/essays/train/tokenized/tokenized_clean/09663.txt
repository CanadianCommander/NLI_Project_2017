the issue under consideration is the argument that most advertisements attempt to project their products in a manner that showcase the products in much better light than they actually are .this issue appears to be a very common and valid statement , since more often than not , it is a general complaint among customers that products never seem to deliver what they promise in their promotions .however , i would like to disagree with this statement , keeping in mind my consideration of certain important factors , such as the process that people use to choose certain products , the efforts being made my manufacturers towards developing their products , government , civic and judicial laws that mandate advertisements to give the correct picture , and the role of public interest groups that strive to increase customer awareness regarding the buying of products .the first point that i would like to highlight is the motivation of customers in buying products .many customers do not realize that the products they buy are actually not targetted at them at all in the first place .for example , people who face hair loss on their scalp tend to buy products like hair loss prevention shampoos , without first checking whether that shampoo is indeed formulated for their problem , which may be occuring due to more serious medical reasons .when such customers do not get the results they expected , they tend to blame the product , and accuse its advertisement of false campaigning .to prevent this , customers should become aware of the fact that they need to excercise discretion and perhaps get some medical or non-medical advice ( like in the shampoo s case ) when choosing products .the next point i would like to emphasize on is the sincere efforts being made manufacturers of products to provide more information on the intended targets of products , product composition , possible shortcomings or side effects of their products , etc , through easily accessible mass communication channels like the internet and television .for example , companies issuing public mutual funds do make it a point to issue a warning at the end of their promotion on television , asking viewers to exercise caution and prior research when investing in their funds .a third very important point to note is the role of government and/or judicial bodies or authorities in passing laws that ensure that advertisements do not make false claims , and allow customers to file suits as applicable , against such companies .i believe that such laws deter advertisers from hyping up their product .finally , any free society has a large number of public interest groups that volunteer to monitor and check wrongful acts such as over-promotion of goods or services in the intent of gaining profit by misguiding customers .such societies provide a framework to actively patrol and educate people about such misleading ventures .in conclusion , i believe , that due to a host of factors , some of which i have detailed above , advertisements of today , though capable , do not actually make deliberate attempts to mislead customers by over-hyping the features of their products .true , they may use popular celebrities to endorse their brands , or use jazzy visuals and other media , but the actual claims made are largely truthful , and they do make sincere attempts to clarify who their target audience is .
