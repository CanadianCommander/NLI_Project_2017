nowadays , the topic of the abusive use of cars by men all around our planet is often discussed because it is quite relevant .it has been observed that since the industrial revolution , which began during the mid-eighteenth century , the span of many environmental changes ( such as the melting of the ice in the north pole ) , which was previously of several thousands of years , has been reduced to a few decades .it seems that there is a direct relationship between this abrupt reduction and the recent activity of men around the earth : the fabrics in which we produce various materials as well as the cars we use release various types of gas in the athmosphere which are causing serious damage to our planet .however , i doubt the acknowledgement of this damage is a motivation powerfull enough to lead most of men to change their habits .there will always be a need for us to move quickly from one place to another .thus the real question is not whether there will be fewer cars in twenty years : many research teams have understood that the real challenge is not the reduction of the number of cars , but the creation of a new generation of cars .as a matter of fact , this new generation already exist : already thirty years ago , electric cars as well as a new type of fuel ( mostly based on biologically non-harmful components ) have been created .however , each one of these two solutions has its drawbacks : the electric cars are either too slow or too fast and this problem has not been solved yet .as regards the new type of fuel , a lot of pressure is being put on governments by lobbies which have financial interests in the selling of the traditional type of fuel , i.e. petrolium .thus i suppose the future of our planet ( to which the use of cars is closely related ) entirely depends either on the progress of science , or on the goodwill of the people in charge . ..
