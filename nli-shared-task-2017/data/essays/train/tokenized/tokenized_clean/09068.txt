young people do contribute to the communities in some or the other way though not all do .but most of them get involved in social activities helping the communities and the society as well .youngsters always have a special feeling for their country and the society they live in which makes them to contribute for the communities .but not all are with that spark , reasons being many like the atmosphere there are brought up , the personal experiences they had and etc .many help their nations by offering social service and thats how they take time to help their communities .youngsters due to many reasons feel a lot for their nation .the have a very good spirit of helping the society .one reason could be the heartwarming delivery of civic lecture from an well versed professor .it could also be the different tv shows broadcasted on the theme of patriotism .young people are engaged in their colleges with variety of tasks .most of the them point to their responsibility towards their nations .the classroom lectures and the general conversation among the peers makes them to think about how well they can do for the betterment of the society .once the thought occurs , the very first answer would be to get involved in social activities by joining a community if not many .i can cite few examples from my personal life .there was this conversation among my peer group with our lecturer guiding us .suddenly , the technical aspects of my country were related with the political issues .on further discussion , it came to my notice that the infants too were the victims for the country s citizen s carelessness towards the society .we started by browsing for communities doing good social service .we all joined it and helped it in encouragin children to opt education over work .we helped a charity home from being devasted by filing a petition in the high court and giving a consistent strong support .in my experience of getting involved in such activities i realised that there are many students and younsters trying to do something for the nation by joining and forming communities .i think things have improved when compared to past regarding the young people .their interests are quite of a matured kind and contribute to the society one or the other way .a living and popular example of youngsters taking enough time to help the society is `` lok paritran  , a party formed by five indian ex-students of iit s .its lucid that they take out more than enough time to help for the nation s betterment .but i admit that not all youngsters take out time for the nation or communities .there are few who dont take time at all and wander here and their ticking their moments way .be it any community , not all show up active participation .few of them keep themselves away from such things intentionally and few are not aware of such activities .few of the younsters are too busy with their acadaemics to even think of extra ciricular activities .few stand right considering their situations and circumstances and few do nt as they dont come forward though they have a chance to .but most of the youth has focussed and is focussing on improving situations around .they join communities and aim for accomplisments that serve better to the society .though not all young people take out time for social activites , majority of them do .few take out a little time and few quite a good time .there are people from the youth who dedicate themselves to communities .coming to a stand would be very difficult because of the varitey of people living and acting according to their circumstances .on and on the , younsters do contribute to the communities by taking out enough time , but not all .
