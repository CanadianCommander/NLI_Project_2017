i disagree with the statement : i think young people are as supportive to their communities as they have always been .of course `` being helpful  has changed rapidly because of technologic and scientific progress changing very quickly , also there could be a sociological explanation to the actual changing of communities which is in my opinion very important to consider .communities have become more and more diverse , difficult to define and cosmopolitan , a good example is the notoious american melting pot , which of course means that not everyone meeting for example in a class at school or in a neighborhood or also in a political group might be participating to the same type of ethnic or economic community .not everyone will therefore know what type of activity a young person is actually doing to support the community he feels more integrated in , or how much time he is dedicating to it .that does nt necessarily mean he is nt participating in community activities .also , our era is moving slowly towards a situation where physical work becomes more and more unimportant and replaceable with technology .that means young people may be performing very economically sustaining tasks , for example buying community products per internet , but you still wo nt see them in the actual community supermarket or drug store performing manual tasks .i actually think that in the situation we live in now , it is much easier to have a strong conscious community identity compared with the ignorant necessity of participation of the past , when many people probably could nt even imagine the existence other parallel communities .in this way , young people are often more actively and spiritually involved in their community life than in the past , a characteristic of which for example we have proof in the still growing popularity of volounteer work , naturally influenced by the greater wealth progress in time has brought to a growing number of people .the so-called `` death of ideals  that probably would be related to the essay statement in the sense that participating in community life represents a form of actively expressing your ideals , is nt really happening in my opinion - it s just that the sudden incredible communication possibilities which were given to my generation and the national boundary openness along with a situation of peace between at least western countries has thrown us into the void of thousands of contact and knowledge possibilities through other cultures and communities .but now , when the general culture comprises more and more of a wide spectrum of cultural , religious , economic and political possibilities , i have the impression that an enormous number of people still feel attached to the culture they come from , their parents , their ancestors etc .genes and community are strong values i doubt history or time will ever distroy .we are not in the brave new world yet , and i do not want to believe that that indifference is the direction we re going in .
