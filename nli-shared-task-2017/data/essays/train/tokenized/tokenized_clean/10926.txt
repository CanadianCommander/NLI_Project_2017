life is a short trip which is full of events and experiences , everyday a new thing comes up , some people born and other die and everything is going so fast . .during this short trip we have the opportunity to try and live as much as possible of it and , we have to be successful in a world were the competition is so hard .therefore , i think trying new things and taking risks is much more better on every scale of life .in bussiness a trader has to have a strong heart and sometimes to gamble in order for his business to succeed .a poor trader im my country syria , had once ordered a large lawn to buy a shipment of ironic materials .the money he paid was too much , but he risked everything he had to buy that goods .he bought the goods by us dollar which was equal to 4 syrian pound .two days before the arrival of the shipment something happened , the syrian currency went down and the dollar is equal to 50sp .by this recless act he became a very rich person .in medicine which is my field of study , we have always to try new things in order to give the best to our patients .in the battle of fighting cancer , huge researches are being counducted to improve the treatment regimens of cancer .where we combine many way of treatment from surgery to medications .some times the impact of these regemins are not always known , but we find patient who are willing to take it .without these attempts we would never overcome cancer .in conclusions , i find that in every domain of life , one should always try new things and live new experience in order to enrich his life and be successful in it .
