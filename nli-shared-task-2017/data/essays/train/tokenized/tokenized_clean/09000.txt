when asked about whether there would be less cars in twenty years than now , different people , however , have different viewpoints , depending on their personal experience , insight of the development of nowadays society and some other factors .the prediction , nevertheless , is difficult to make .as far as i am concerned , the number of cars in twenty years will increase in developing countries .on the other hand decreace in developed countries .among those countless factors that affect my opinion , i would only explore a few primary ones as follows .the essential reason why cars in developing country will become more and more in 20 years is that developing countries are more likely to develope their industry as their first goal in the follwing years .as a result , car , an important criteria to show the level of the development of a developing country , will be more and more under the leading of government .a good case in point is the faster and faster growing number of cars in china .the goverment of the country has recently imported the core technology of car-manufactory from some japaness company .this would lead to the decline of the price of cars in domestic market to encourage people to buy cars .so , there is no doubt that there would be more and more cars in china .therefore , i believe that in developing countries , there will be more and more cars .and an important reason of the decrease of number of cars in developed country is that the developed coutries are paying more attention on the protection of enviroment in these years .and their public transportation system is good enough to support the growing number of people who use bus or underground .countries such as england , fance and the usa are now undergoing the situation i have illustrateed above .as , what has been discussed above , you will be sure to know why i has the opinion stated in the first paragraph .
