i think that the statement is wrong , not because of what it tells could be false , that could be , but because it leads to a likely huge misunderstanding .it is not difficult from the statement to infer that young people nowadays have become more selfish and less worrisome about their neighbours or communities .that is , that they ignore the meaning of the word ` solidarity  .and the figures can not depart from this idea .a survey conducted last year gauging the enrollment of young people in projects whose aim was to improve the quality of life of the underdogs , showed that the ratios had dramatically plummeted down during the last decade .we are unable to deny the facts , but being that said , i think that fairness should be put on stage .it may be true that young people devote less time to help people that really need assistance , but the measure is in absolute terms , not in relative ones .in order to shed some light on this topic , let us have a look around the duties a young person must face today in comparison to those faced by young people ten o twenty years ago .if we do so , we will find that it is rather difficult for a young person nowadays to find time to devote to solidarity projects .was anybody obliged twenty years ago to speak fluently three languages to get a good job ?was the burden of the academic studies so heavy as it is now ?an extremely competitive society has made people concentrate on themselves , rather than thinking to get their close environment better , not because of disengagement but because of obligation .this fact will fix the point .if we take a look at the number of young donors to non govermental organisations ( ngos ) we will find that the funds have soared during the last few years .if we asess the enrollment ratios in some of them , like the red cross , focusing on periods of vacation like the summer , we will see a similar pattern .to sum up , young people nowadays devote more time and resources to carry on projects to help their communities relative to the time they can afford .the problem is that this spare time is scarce .there is a lack of hours , not of eagerness .
