to be realistic i guess it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .but that does not mean if u get older you can no longer enjoy life , but instead your ability to enjoy life decreases .to be more specific your physical ability decreases as you get older putting u in more risk of getting sick thus spending more time at the hospital and seeing the doctor and i do not think any one enjoys that .moreover young people are more fit than older people thus are preferable to do things old people can not do , like going skydiving going to places u have never been ther before like going to space , not having to follow a certain diet in other words eat whatever you want , things old people can not do for health and physical reasons .more , young people in a society are allowed to go clubing , go on dates , flirt with the opposite sex , dress whatever you want . ..while as for an adult doing what i mentiond is bad for your image in the society . ..so by being an adult their are a lot of things you can not experience in life for different reasons .but as i mentioned being an adult does not mean u can no longer enjoy life .you can still do in a different way for instance , as an adult you can enjoy life and have fun through spending time with your children and their children and by watching your child grow and raise him to become a successfull individual in the society he is living in , also by having a quite and peacful time enjoying a certain lovely view in nature such as watching the sun go down with your wife .but in my opinion now the activities young people do allows you to enjoy life have a taste of it more than the activities you do as an adult well at least thats what i think now maybe in the future when i get old and live life as an aduld i might change my mind but for now ill enjoy life in my way .
