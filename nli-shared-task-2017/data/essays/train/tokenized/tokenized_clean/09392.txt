have you noticed how crowded of young people shops are at anytime in the cities ?young people nowadays loved to have more and more things and spend much of their time on this without considering the needs that our community have .in my opinion young people behavior seems to me selfish and not helpful with the community .first of all , capitalistic society we are living contribute young people to consume .for example , the ads on televison help to create expectative of having things and consume more .furthermore , shops everywhere make citizien feel confortable because we know we can have what we need just going shoping .what i mean is that is not possible to think in enjoyable things all the time , youth needs to consider other aspects .regarding to this , we can be helpful at the same time we enjoy as we do shoping .we can reach this aim for example helping beggars recolecting money in groups along the streets .for instance we can have a chat with old people who are on their own sitting in a bench on the park , just to make them have a good time .in short , considering young people do nt help too much the community what i suggest is that we can help the community we are living and at the same time have a great time doing simple things .
