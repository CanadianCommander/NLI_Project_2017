i do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .this i concluded from my own personal experience , and the personal experiences of my relatives and friends .i have , on several occassion , actually purchased , a whole range of products , like lipstick , soaps , detergents , clothes , etc , after having seen them being advertised on tv .but on most occasions , i was not happy with the product in hand , they simply did not match the quality that they claimed in the advertisement .in a leading brand shampoo advertisement , for example , it was claimed , that the regular use of the shampoo for a months time , would lead to the complete dissapearance of dandruff .believing this claim , i bought the shampoo for my self , and used it as advised .but the results , were very un satisfactory , after its use not only did the dandruff problem continue to persist , it had in fact much worse than what it was before it s use .similarly , a leading health drink brand , in its advertisement claimed that , this was , by far the best health drink availble in the market , and it tastes much better than any other brand .falling pray to their claim , i changed my brand of health drink .i purchased this , instead of the one that i had been using for a long time .to my surprise , i found almost no differece between the two brands , not only this , there was no added health advantage i recieved form the usage of this brand , which i did not recieve from the usage of the earlier one .my relatives , friends , and many of you as well will have similar experiences to recount .indeed advertisements make tall claims about the products , and they have ways to make their products look much better than they actually are .for example , let us talk about a leading brand energy bar advertisement .in this add they show a well built athlete , on the race track , sand claim that we can be like him we use the energy bar .but some thinking will tell us , that there is nio way of guessing how the athlete got his health .a sneak into the athleats personal life will tell us that .not the addadvertisement , should not be belived , they are there to sell products , and to do that they can go to any extent to make thir product look better than those of their competitors .as a result of which most end up making tall claims about the product and make the consumer buy these .after susequent use the consumer realises the product is not as good as it was claimed in the advert
