in some countries , there is a tough controversy about the final objective of education .should it deal with a maximum academic subjects , so as to provide a vast general knowledge to the students , or should it rather focus on a specific matter , in order to prepare the youngsters to their confrontation with the professional world ?first , i am convinced that it is a nonsense to force the students to specialize too early .they have to try a great variety of subjects before genuinely being aware of what truely interests them .by granting them some time to think , a varied schedule will allow them to make a valid choice and to change their mind , if necessary .then academic subjects are often complementary .when you have the possibility to study a lot of different subjetcs , you can observe how they interact and get a more critical view on a particular topic .for instance , every human science tries to explain how human beings behave in a society : economy , philosophy , psychology , anthropology , they all give us a different theory about the way we choose , decide , react in our environment .by acquiring the basics in several of those subjects , a student will be able to shape his own opinion .in addition , every subject has in his fundamental course some elements that belong to our society s common knowledge .our culture is defined by our history , as well as our litterature , but also what we know in biology , physics , art or even sport .having a few hints about what is important to know in each field is a major requirement to understand current events , or more generally to gain tolerance to different opinions and beliefs .however , i also want to advocate for the necessity of an eventual specialization .indeed , before entering the professional world , being particularly skilled in a given field is a moajor competitve advantage .in the prospect of getting a job , a graduating student must think about what counts for the recruiters he will face .if you want to be a botanist , it may not be useful to pursue advanced macroeconomics .
