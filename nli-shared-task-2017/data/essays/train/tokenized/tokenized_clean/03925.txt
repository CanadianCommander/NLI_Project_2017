i agree with the statement that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .the advertisements including not only those on tv shows but also on the newspaper .the perpose of these advertisements is letting the customers think the products are good and want to buy them .the perpose made the advertisement do these .in order to let the customers think the products are worth to buy , what they need to do is to show the product is good enough and worth them to buy .the advertisement has to make the product looks better than other similar products , then they have to made up things to show the product is better than others .this is the reason why the products seem much better than they really are .in china , the advertisements make the products looks like they were perfect are normal .there are many similar products in china at the same time .making the products that thay sell looks best is the most important thing to make their product sell well .for instance , i bought an expensive pen which it said will nerver broken under any condition in the advertisement on tv .but only after three months that i found the pen was broken already .i found the seller to ask for return .the seller said something that made me understand the true propose of the advertisements .do you think there will be a pen that never breaks in the world ?i do nt think so .she said to me in a smile .all the advertisement do these , not only us .from that on , i do nt believe any advertisement anymore .there are more than one example can show that the advertisement made products seem better than they really are .base on my own experience that i can tell the statement is true all the time .
