there has been a wide discussion about the behavior of young people during the last years .one of the critical points often provided by people is that nowadays more and more young people stop to spend free time for community activies .before i point out my personal opinion to this statement i would like to have a look at the overall situation in my country and beyond referring youths doing community work .in germany it has never been very common to do community supporting activities .since the state with its highly developed welfare system took over most of the tasks , youths were nt that much demanded to do voluntary community work .i know that we can find different situations in other countries .for instance , in the usa , if one wants to study at a good university as harvard or princeton , next to your good grades you should also show some evidence that you have carried out some community work .also in east germany before the unification it was common that groups of young people helped out the community in for example providing recycling stations , newspaper services .children and young people even helped out on the fields of the nationally owned farms .although these tasks were nt often made voluntary , it increased the feeling of the youth to be connected to its community and helping each other .nowadays i think that the feeling for the need of community work more and more disappears .among young people it is even a reason to be kicked out of a group when one is doing community work .it s not fancy enough .the feeling that everyone has to care for himself is spreading around .noone cares about other persons due to individualistic behavior patterns of the 21st century .sometimes it is the case that even neighbors do nt know each other and therefore would never come up with the idea to help each other .but this is not a `` young people  problem .if the parents do nt live a life where helping other persons is a part of , how can their children learn that it is important to spend some of their free time with community work ?additinally young people today can do so much more things .why doing community work in groups when sitting in front of the television or playing a video game is so much easier and more comfortable ?therefore i agree with the statement above .reasons for it can be found in many areas but the most important one i think is the tendency of the society to stay for oneself and do nt care about others .
