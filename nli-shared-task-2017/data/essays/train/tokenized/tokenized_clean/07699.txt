many people think it is betters to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .there has tow reasons that i choose this one .one reanson that is broad knwoledge is very important for us , if we want go abroad .we should have a lot of broad knowledge to gain our personal knowledge .we always stay in china , we have not know a lot of others country history , and this knowledge are still very important to us .if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects we can solve many problems , and we can aslo help others .in another hand , broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more interesting than any other knowledge .in china , many students have no chance to learn some other countrys knowledge .than always listen to the teachers and take note without any personal ideas , this problem has becoming harder and harder .the reanson why i donot choose to have specialize in one specific subject is that i have one experence .when i was 11 years older , i m interested in computer science , and i do a lot of time on it .althought i have known many knowledge on it , i get bad score on other class .a student who have broad knowledge of many academic subject can easily take part in a new student envrionment , but a student who have specialize in one specific subject just can do one thing that he or she can do .according to this above , i think a student had better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
