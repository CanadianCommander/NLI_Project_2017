young people mostly experience things first .while doing new things that youngs did nt do before can enjoy them .older peoples experienced most of the joy of the life , and to do that things again entartain less than youngs .young people have more energy to do enjoyable things .youngs are always in the way of doing new , more enjoyable things .so while capability of doing things gave youngs joy .olders have less energy so they only use their energy to do the things that inevitable for thie life .they rest in most of their time , eat meals , sleep and do other requirements of life .they mostly can not do what they want or what they do when they were young .the disability of doing the things that desired make olders unhappy .on the other hand olders think the death more than youngs .to think die in short time do the olders being pessimist about life .they think what they did in their lives most of time .the wrongs and right things .but the wrongs effect most .if he thinks of his life with full of errors he ca nt enjoy from the remaining life .but olders can enjoy when they bring their childrens , and see grandsons and granddaughters running around them respect them .most of the olders desire this scene .if they can live this scene they can enjoy more than youngs .
