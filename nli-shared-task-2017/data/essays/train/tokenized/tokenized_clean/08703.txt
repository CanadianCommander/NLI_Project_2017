the main purpose of the advertisement is not only make customers to understand products but also make products look nicer and better .thus , i totally agree with the following statement .all people would have experienced the power of the advertisement a lot of times .i have a few examples to support my idea .when i go to the mall , i see the new products each time .one of them is cell phone .i watch the tv almost everyday , mostly advertisement , i see the new cell phones everytime .so many abilities of cell phone lured me to buy it , such as camera , mp3 , recorder , mirror , and walky talky .although i thought i will going to use it for sure , i did not use those abilities not much as i thought i would .because those abilities were less than i expected .i will buy digital camera rather than camera phone , mp3 player rather than mp3 phone .i was lured by watching advertisement .i did not see the inside of cell phone but only believed in my vision .everytime i go to watch movie , i always decided to see the movie that has interesting poster , or has interesting short scene from the advertisement .there are so many times that i regreted .i realized that advertisements are important as much as qualities of the products .i would not think that movies can not success without the advertisements .the purpose of the advertisement is lure customers .there are people make interesting advertisement , and that s what they are for ; make it look better and nicer .the market of the advertisements is growing , sometime company spend a lot of money to make best advertisement rather than make better quality .however , we need to be warned before we purchase the products as well as understading the products .
