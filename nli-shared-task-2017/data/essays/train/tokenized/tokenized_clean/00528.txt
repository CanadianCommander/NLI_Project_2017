some people would like to travel by themseleves , while other prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .of course , there are some benefits of each side ; however i would like to travel by myself especailly when i have a long trip so i do nt agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .because it has no pravicy and inconvenient .first , i would like mention that the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is actually not because of its invonvenience .several years ago , i went to austarila for traveling by myself .i visited so many famous places in big cities and also went to non-famous areas in such small towns .bascially i could go wherever i want to go and do whatever i want to do .due to the fact that i do nt need to think about the schedule of tour guide .if i was in a group led by a tour guide , i had to follow the schedule .besides , something that i want to visit or do may not be part of the tour .second , the best way to travel is not good because i do nt have much free time and pravicy .for instance , when i visit a certain place that i may want to spend more time .if you travel in a group , there is less free time and pravicy .in addition to , you will have to follow the rest of your groupin conculsion , if you want to travel in freely whatever you would like to do and visit without concerning the tour schecule or time , in my opinion , the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide is not good .since we wo nt get much free time , pravicy and tour in a group is inconvenient so i would rather have a trip alone eventhough there are a few advantages of group tour .
