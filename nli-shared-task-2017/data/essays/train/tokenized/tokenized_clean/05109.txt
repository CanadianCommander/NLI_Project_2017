i agree with this idea .because , i think for be successful people they need have confidence themself decision and think .so , i think if , people who scared of risk or do nt want to take risk .that kind person ca nt be successful people .because , i think this word is realistic and useful for this world `` no risk no return .`` high risk high return .successful people they have confidence themselves .so , they can creat new thing and they can try to new thing .if people do nt have confidence themselves , they ca nt creat anything .how they even can try new thing .that mean is they even can take a risk .if , people feel satisfy and they tend to defence itself about sociallity position and money .according that word `` no risk no return  i think they just will lose money and position .if people feel satisfaction about their potision and money , they do nt want do anything without difende themselves .people gearn money from their move .even smart people or people who do nt have any creer and skills , they ca nt earn money without move .so , simply people who only do defence , they ca nt earn money .although , they need money for defence themselves .
