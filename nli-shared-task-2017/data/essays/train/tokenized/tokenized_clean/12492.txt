i agree with this statement .i believe that in life people have to change their normal habitat and go through different changes in order to succeed .when people are accustomed to see the same things every day and lack change in their lives , sooner or later they will develop a sense of insecurity and may even get scared to the change .i am not trying to say that people should make increasing or sudden changes in their daily , basis of life , but instead , to be more enduring and accept change if it is possible .for example , in the movie `` homeless to harvard  , the protagonist , liz , was born with a drug addict mother , and a father who does not take responsability of her .liz inly faces negative aspects of life and does not even go to school .for example , instead of her mother taking care of her , liz is the one who takes care of her mother while being a teenager and has a lack of responsible parent figure .after her mother dies , liz is left lonely and the only thing that gives her security is her encyclopedia because is the only key she had to learn , after never going to school .liz goes through a shocking change in her life that probably no one would imagine because she gets rid of that awful past and decides not to be like the familiar world she sees , but get educated and go to school .after two years of studying , she entered harvard university .liz goes through a change in her life that brings her from completely unsuccesful to completely successful .she is able to complete her dream and what she wanted to do most in her life an would never have imagined .people who have negative feelings among their lives should use change as a defense mechanism .people should not dwell among their past or present , they should endure it and seek for possibilities of a better life .taking risks may be a huge factor and also difficult because people always see a change as something insecure .this is why , as stated before , succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
