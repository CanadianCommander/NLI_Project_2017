i agree that successful people try news things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , for these reasons ; by trying new things allow you to be curious to know how someone did it and you will find out how to do it too , that way it make you make a research .by trying new things allow you to be positive in your mind and to have a great desire to succed no matter how difficult is the situation .by trying new things you no that you should be openminded , go through disscussion with people who have done the same thing to learn their ways of doing thing , you should meet or have conversation with a lot of these people in other to learn from their experiences .by trying new things you take a big risks , like in `` french we say if you do nt risk you do nt have anything  , risk in a goog way to takle something .we never know if we might succed or not the only way to do it is to risk .since we do not loose anything when we risk .edas for me doing the same thing every day become boring , i can say is a waste of energy and time ,to conclude , people who succed try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
