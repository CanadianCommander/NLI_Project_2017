in life there are situations for everything .in case of this statement i belive that there are certain times when the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide but there are also sometimes that you want to travel with your family , friends or by yourself .it depends on your expectations of the trip and how you like to travel .traveling with a tour guide is always much more practical and easier .here , most of the time things work as they are supposed to work .flights are booked , hotels have reservations , restaurants are good , times are scheduled and things just run easly .this is a perfect choice for a first time visit to a place .if you only have a couple of days , and want to get to know as much as you can , a tour is perfect .it will show you all around , the most interesting sites and what everyone talks about .in the other hand , traveling by yourself is completely different , here you get to make your own choices .you decide when you want to wake up , at what time and where you want to go to dinner and what museums you want to go visit .this is a much more relaxing time .it is a perfect situation for a second time visit , here you get to go to the places you most liked the last time you visited and do exactly what you want .it requires much more individual planning , well no one is going to to that job for you , but it also has certain priviledges .i also belive that a group and a tour is not a thing for everyone .you have to be tolerant with the other people around and you have to let people boss you .if you are not a type or person that likes to rush and be with a lot of people , traveling by yourself is the best choice .i dont think you can say what is best , you just have to consider the type of trip you want to have and the type of person you are .then you can make the right choice and enjoy a perfect trip .
