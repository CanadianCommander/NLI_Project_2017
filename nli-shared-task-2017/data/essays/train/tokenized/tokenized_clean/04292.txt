nowadyas , every one wants to make an advertisment for every thing that he has .ths is because it is a very helpful way to let people know about what you have , and what it looks like .advertisements are a way that helpe people to know some information about the products , but a lot of peple exagorate in advertising about their products .some people do nt know a lot about the itmes that they want , and they buy them without knowing any information about them unless when they read an advertisment .for example , when some one want to buy a computer , he may read something about it and then he goes to buy it .he may not find the right person to ask about what he wants to buy , so he believes what is written on the advertisments .on the other hand , some companies take this thig as awy to help them in selling their products .they may make a lot of advertisments to let people buy what they have .it is imprtant to have someone has an experions in some cases because companies like to exagorat in their products .when you want to buy something you sould buy something reasonable , or you should ask some that he knows about what you are buying .in my case , when i want to buy a computer i ask my borther about it because he is very good in computers , and he knows every thing about them .it is importnat to buy something that you know because you are not going to know about it till you buy it .companies sould care about how the people feel when they buy their products because when they do this they are not going to exagorate in their products .on the other hand people should know what they are buying beucase it is safer for their money .
