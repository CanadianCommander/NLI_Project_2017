i would only partially agree with the statement since i feel that even though many parts of the world could see fewer cars in use in the future , there are some parts of the world where there could be use of more cars .i think that , in the developed countries , where there is already a very high cars per person ratio , the use of the number of cars would come down whereas in the underdeveloped parts of the world where this ratio is currently very very less , the number of cars might go up infact .the passages below explain how .firstly there is no doubt that the shortage of fuel is going to be a big problem twenty years from now .this would contribute to lessening of car numbers and care usage in the future .also the increased levels of pollution especially in countries which are highly industrialized , for example many parts of europe and north america , would lead to the reduction in the number of cars with the objective of reducing pollution .the governments in these countries would also be able to afford excellent public transport systems that would enable the public at large to commute confortably even without cars .also the rising levels of health consciousness could mean people preferring to use more of bycycles and other modes of transport that give some exercise to the body .however there are parts of the world that are highly underdeveloped for example parts of africa and asia and here the levels of industrialisation are very low .twenty years from now , these parts would be more developed and hence more money would come into the hands of the people there .these people would naturally like to enjoy the luxury of a car for the first time in their lives .therefore , in these parts the number of cars could go up .
