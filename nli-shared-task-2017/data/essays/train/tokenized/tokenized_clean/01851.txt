learining is a very disputable word .few persons generally misjudge it with introduction , understanding or craming etc .but it is very necessary that what we learned should be same as that of what we understand .it s very common among the students to learn the facts rather than to understand the ideas behind it .they always looking for short term goals usually their examination .but it creates a great problem when they get a applied question in the examination .few questions are based on uderstaning of concept .these types of question are usually not mention in the text books .if you donot uderstand the motto or theme of subject , it s very difficult to apply it in the current field , other fields or after a short time span .one will foreget the things just after few days or months .but if we evaluvate the subject fully , its a life long achivement .we can use the same concept in different streams or at any time .for instance , if an agriculturist beleive in learning facts ; may be he will able to acheive a good grades , but practically he will not able to apply his knowledge in his field as agriculture is an applied science .the understanding leads to development of creativity and if an agriculturist is not creative , he will not able to investigate the new techniques .similarly , if an engineering student learn the facts of the principle of working of a maching rather than to understand it , he can only handle that particular type of machine and never think about a new discovery .on the other hand if got basic idea , he can renovate the maching according to the requirement of time .every field of study require application of your skills rather than to copy it , which can be only possible when the students will understand the ideas rather than learning the facts .today s time is for ideas holding persons which is entirely based on creativity ; ultimately understanding .
