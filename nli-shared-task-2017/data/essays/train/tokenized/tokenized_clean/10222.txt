there are two existing views about the expected number of cars in the future .one might think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , others might think that the number of cars will not be fewer in twenty years , even that number will increase .i also believe that the number of cars in use will increase as the time passes .first of all , i believe that the number of cars in use will increase gradually within time because when we compare today s situation with the past , we see that the number of cars in use considerably increased within time .since i believe that the past is the mirror of the future , i also believe that the number of cars in use will increase in twenty years as it did in the past .moreover , i think that the number of cars in use will increase as the time passes as a consequence of growing car industry and by the help of media and commercials .since there is a growing car industry all over the world , the producers produce as much as they can .most of the people can find a car that they like .there are variety of cars and at least one of them take the attention of the consumer .moreover , by the help of media , the cars that are produced can be easily seen and discovered by the consumer .it is hard to not get impressed by the appealing car commercials .to sum up , despite the fact the some people believe that the number of cars in use will decrese in twenty years , i strongly disagree that it will happen .such as the incrase in the number of cars in use in the past , i think it will also increase in the future .moreover ; the growing car industry and the effect of media will support that increase .
