the humanity has experienced numerous series of developments .but if it were not for new equipments that allowed for efficient hunting of animals , farming that made stable livelihood possible , and the development of internet that brought the world together , we would nt be living in the world so conveniently as now .the same thing could generally be applied to humans themselves .thus , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than focusing on what they can do well .only doing what one already know how to do well leaves no space for any further advancement .a story of mine would be an example .i used to be very weak in mathematics despite the fact that i try to solve a lot of problems .without knowing the reasons , i went to a math academy where the teacher found the reason for me .i was only solving the problem that i knew how to solve ; i was avoiding hard ones .thereafter , i try to solve whatever i confronted and became good at math .it is also a historically proven fact .if the wright brothers had nt tried to fly like a bird , or if they gave up in the progress because of the adversities and risks , the airplanes would nt have been invented .if samsung s lee geun-hee had nt tried semiconduct some decades earlier than any other company s leaders , korea would nt have been able to credit samsung for its assistance in the coutry s developments .some might argue with a famous proverb , ` jack of all trades and master of none  , claiming that concentrating on what one knows best is advisable rather than trying everything .yet ` failure is the mother of success  rebuts that proverb .even when something is out of one s specialty , it still is worth trying because that could possibly give the person new perspectives and understandings .although it seems risky and needs a lot of courage to take on new things , one must proceed in order to success ; it s the common characteristic of successful people .as is proven personally and historically , and by a well-accepted proverb , it could be said that trying new things and facing risks bring success .
