we all know that young people are more energetic and more healther than older people .i can feel that in my life experience , my mother stay at home every weekend , i ask her why she do nt go outside , she always give me the answer such as `` no . ..i feel tired `` or  no . ..i m not interesting about outside stuff  .beacuse of these reason i believe that young people can enjoy life and do more activities than older people do .on of the reason is that older people get tired easily , they may even have some problem with their body system .in such case , they can not go mountain climbing , go disco with friends , go shopping for 5 hours long .they ca nt bear these carzy activities , therefore they will miss some chances to know more about vivd life , and the other reason is that young people , like me , we usually go for a trip with our friends in the spring break or summer vacation , we see or gain more information by this activity , we know more cultures from other country and people , that is older people prabebily ca nt do .i believe many parents , includ my parent told to their children , participate in more activities and enjoy life when we are still young , because after graduate from university we have to concentrate on our career , try do be a succesful people in the society .after age 30 , we focus more on our family ( especially women ) , after 40 we do ore best to earn money yo support family , after 50 we have no energy at all to enjoy our life .
