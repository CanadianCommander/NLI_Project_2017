in television , papers and magazines a lot of people discuss , how our streets will look in twenty years .a lot of these discussion focus on the amount of cars .reasons for this discussion are the changes energy supply and the pollution problem .the main reason , why there might be less cars , is that the petroleum resources are decreasing .some experts say they only last about ten years .another reason might be the increasing pollution .politicans might introduce stronger laws or raise the tax on fuel to reduce the pollution .this could result in a decreasing amount of cars .a seldom focused reason migth be : several people are going to share one car .this development can already be seen in germany .in the last years the amount of car shareing stations has raised .a raisuig usage of public transportation might also decrease the amount of cars .on the other side , there are a lot of reasons why the amount of cars will not decrease .the amount of cars has been raising through the last century and this trend may continue .there are also a lot of new engine techniks .these techniks allow cars be driven with solar power or hydrogen .these resources are not expected the be lass availible .even an combination of an fuel engine and these techniks is possible .so the amount of cars will be constant , because the prices for these new technologies will fall .i think , the amount of cars will not fall .there will be differences in the type of cars .i think the cars will need less energy and produce less pollution the current cars .but since the car always has been a status symbol , a lot of people will want a car .the public transportation will not have an big rule in the future , because most goverments do nt have enough money to support this .
