if i had to refer only to my personal experience i would have to completely agree with the statement .fortunately not every youngster is like me .i must confess that i have never taken part to community service , which in my home country , italy , young men could choose as an alternative to military service .a bill has been passed that frees my generation from military service and thus also from `` compulsory  community service .i might have justfied my behavior by saying that nowadays the sense of community that used to animate the life of suburbia and countryside villages has been lost ; that work conditions and habits have changed and all in all people are less and less tied to their own communities .they think and act global .but the fact that i am selfish does not imply that so are my fellow citizens of the same age .i have many friends devoted to at least one community service activity .my best female friend has been active in the emergency transport service , that brings patients to emergency rooms and hospitals for the past five years and she is still on duty once a week every thursday night .it is worth to mention that in italy this service is run on a voluntary basis .finally one can extend what i have mentioned about the fading of local communities and claim that the young should take care of the global communtiy and especially its poorest members .more and more young women and men are now spending their holidays in non governmental organizations active in the poorest part of the world .as far as i am concerned i have never joined these programs , but my sister and some frinds of mine did last year .they were helping in a small hospital in satellite town of kolkata , india .so , hopefully , the picture is not so bleak , at least as long as my friends persist in their altruism .
