i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .because that is the reason why the advertisements really are .in almost all advertisements we can see only the good sides of the product .we can only see the side effects or bad consequences only when there is any law or regulations that they should indicate them like tabbaco or medicine .advertisers want to sell their product more and more and have to compete with the product of other companies .so they show the good-looking product with great function and hide the defects .and another reason is that the advertisements are made in the best circumstances in which the product can function most effectively .for example , in the clothing advertisement we can see the idealy good shaped person wearing the product .and we imagine the look that we are going to have with that clothes similar to the advertisement and come to buy the product .that is why i agree with this statement .
