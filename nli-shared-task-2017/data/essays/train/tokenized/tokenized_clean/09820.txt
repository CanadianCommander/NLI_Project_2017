i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do because young people want to discover the world , they usually have more energy than older people and they are not really worriend about the future .young people enjoy more their life simply because they do nt know a lot of things .this is an extra motivation to enjoy almost anything that they go through .more over , young people always want to taste by themselves everything that surrounds them and they will always try to discover new and exciting things .some things that probably older people wo nt do are for example do extreme sports , traveling around the world and so on .this could happen because of a lack of energy by the older people .energy is really important to enjoy life .young people are usually full of energy because of their youthness , which is a disadvantage for older people who are usually tired of working and spend their free time recovering .a lot of people would say that energy is not necessary to enjoy life and that could be true .another way to enjoy life is to get a relax time , but again young people can enjoy more this relaxed times because they are less tired than older people are .older people are usually busy with their jobs because they are worried about their future .although young people are also worried about their future , they will always be less worried on this kind of issues .this less worried attitude lead us to think about a lack of resposability by young people .but that s what makes life more enjoyable .young people will always think they have a whole life towards them and that is a relief from some worries that older people usually have .every person can enjoy life to the maximun , but for sure young ones will enjoy it more because their path in life has just began and they still have a long road to go through it , which makes life more enjoyable and exciting .
