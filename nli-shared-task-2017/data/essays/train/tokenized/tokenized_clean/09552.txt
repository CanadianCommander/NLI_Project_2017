i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because nothing happens without trying something new .i could also be able to learn new thing from risks .since i already know the thing , that would not tell me anymorefirst , if i am afraid of doing something new and do nt make any action , i would nt get any reaction which i needed .trying new things and taking risks , i can concentrate on doing the things .without risk , i might spoil myself because of the lack of tentions .for example , when i came to america to learn english , i was afraid of speaking english and making mistakes ; therefore , i tried to escape having a long conversation with americans .short one like greeting made me calm because i knew how to do it .however , my english skill was nt improved at all .second , i think i can learn better from mistakes which are same as risks .to take risk , i could see new things that i could nt see without risks .similarly as first example , i didnt want to make any mistakes and i cared about my english grammer as perfect english too much , so i could nt speak much .one day , my american friend asked me why i cared of the grammer so much and advised me not to afraid , and then i could learn more .since the time , i started to take risks .sometimes american was not nice when they knew i was not a native speaker ; however , most of them taught me how to use correct words in sentences .that s the reason why my english was improved .i believe there are more lessons from failure than success .repeating what i already know is sometimes boring .it is possible that some people catches me up , and starts doing same things as me .at the time i am not a successful person anymore .if i continue doing same things , they would become old and useless .in conclusion , to be a successful person , i need to keep doing new thing which nobody can not follow and take a risk for great knowledge from failure .nothing happens seems to be the safest , but at the same time , it means no change and profit in my life .
