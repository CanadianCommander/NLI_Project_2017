there is a general consideration that young people like life than older people .undoubtedly , there are some challenging examples of that statement but it might be accepted as true .according to data from the survey which measures and compares the satisfaction levels of young and old people , young people are more satisfied than old people .the results of the survey highlights three main reasons for that .these are related to life expectation , experience and health .firstly , expectations of life vary according to age .as indicated in survey , there is a strong correlation between expectation such as having a good career and a family and age .people in older age have minimum level of expectations since they think that they are close to complete their lives .on the other hand , respondents ranging from 15 to 26 age think that they have plenty of time to do whatever they want .one good example belongs to a guy who is 16 years old .he wants to be a president of his country in five years .although it sounds unrealistic , it shows his high expectation towards life .secondly , young people have less life experiences than older people and tend to feel more excited about the events which they do not have to deal with yet .additionally , they like adventures and risky events which they do not predict the results .therefore , they can be more productive than older people by creating ideas and innovating new things .in other words , the idea of having less life experience encourages them to elaborate their ideas .thus , this process may reveal brilliant ideas .thirdly , young people feel themselves more healthier than old people .it motivates them to take a role in social events and meet people who they do not know .they have a variety of opportunities to spend their lives out .this enables them to improve their skills about life .consequently , it seems that young people are more willing to be in real life because of their immaturity .however , it provides a platform for them to shape their personality and increases the satisfaction of the life .
