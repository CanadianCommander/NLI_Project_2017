but you for your professional work you have to be specialised in a specific subject .because today you have to be one of the best in your field to success and to be able to answer to all questions .but their is not just the professiopnal world who is important .and you ca nt progress if you are just able to speack about your jobin my opinion it s very important to have a general culture to be able to discuss from all topic with other people , to be able to understand the world , the art .you have to be aware on the world .but general culture isvital in the all days life .history is very important for example .and you ca nt forget the history of humanity .it s a question of respect but it s important to do not make the same mistake as in the past too .another argument is that to have knowledge in some field can help you in other subject .for exemple you ca nt study art without having knowledge in history .and i think that study mathematics can bring the logic you need to understand philosophy .that s why i think it s important to have a minimum of knowledge in all the fields and to be specialised in one of them .i think that the studies have to bring this balance betwenn the general culture and the specialisation .it s the key of the satisfaction of a person .
