the best way o travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i agree this topic beacuse usullay when you go another country or city , you heard something or you prepared to travel .if you have a tour guide you dont need to look something about this place .tour guides usually know this place because they are doing this job .and they can know everything about this city : about history , shopping centers , natural parks , ...ect .so i want to talk about my expresions .i went to italy with tour guide .it was fantastic .i went rome and it was a so beatiful place .it was historical place and they can make best ice cream in the world .when we went there we dont know what we gone a do and when we arrived rome internatoinal airport our our guide was waited us .he came to near us and he discribe his self .and he told us lets go to our hotel and be ready to rome .so we slept and next morning we woke up 6 am. and we took a perfect breakfast .first we went to lovers hole .he discribe about history and why all peoples throw quarters to here .and we traveled everywhere .also we have lot of free times .in those times you can travel your self .you can see everywhere whit this tour guide .but sometimes this can be whore thing in the world .some tour guides doesnt know anything about city or that place and they couldnt tell anything about city .it can be so boring .but usually tour guides selected persons .and they know three or four langue .and usually they were born in yhis city or they were lived in this city .they can take special historical class for those tours .i belive the best way to travel is in a group whit tour guide .because if you dont want to join group , you can stay and you can travel by your self or usually they give you free time to travel in this place .this is the best way to travel .
