nowadays , people can not only get very much information on television or newspapers or magazines and also subway even more on streets .i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are several reasons are first .i have seen many people who buy some products on internet shopping mall often return products , second , it is broken easily .i saw many times that some people returned products .it is usually sell on internet shopping mall and home shopping .for example , i have experience .in korea , home shopping is general .i saw the program to sell gelly shoes .it showed very cute and pretty .but it delivered to me , i was disappointed because it was different when i was seeing .so i had to return it .somtimes , many people are attrated good models who are advertise special products .people can not bear for temptation .all advertisements are not lie .just a few products show much better than real products .b
