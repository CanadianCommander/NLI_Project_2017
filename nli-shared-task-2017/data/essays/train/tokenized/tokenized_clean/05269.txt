i disagree with the statement that young pepole nowadays do not give enough time to helpling teir communities .there are two reasons .one is the recognization of the importance of volunteers in disasters and the other is preparing for aging societies .first , the importance of volunteers have been recognized among young people recently .for example , strong earthquake hit the hanshin and awazi areas in 1995 .tv news show broadcasted the situation and many young people shoked with the situation of the areas .at that time , many young volunteers went to those areas and worked for the communities .tv news show also broadcasted those young volunteers .as a result , many young people have realized the importance of working for the societies .so many young people have started to think about the communities in emergency since the disaster .second , population in japan is aging very rapidly and also inferred more and more in the future .even now there are many older people in japan , it is also estimated that about one third of the japanese population will be the people over aged 65 in 2050 .some older people are healthy , but some are not .unhealthy older people usualy need help to do their daily works .so many young people nowadays think that they must work for the older people .for example , nursely home insurance system has been introduced in japan in 2000 .people have thought about helping only their parents before .but aging of society caused people to think not only their parents but also many older people in their communities .this made the japanese government introduce that system .in the system , many young pepole are taking part of helping the older people in the communities .so many young people are concerning with helping them .for these reasons , i disagree with the statement that young pepole nowadays do not give enough time to helpling teir communities .
