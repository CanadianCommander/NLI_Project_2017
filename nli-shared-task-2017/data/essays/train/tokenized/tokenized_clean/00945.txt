a successful person need not necessarily try new things and take risks .the knowledge of a particular craft or art and developing on it could also make a person successful .there are a lot of artists , painters , musicians , dancers who already know a particular skill or have a specific talent and they dwell on it , improve it , specialize in it and become successful .different strokes for different folks .some people are successful academically , others do well in athletics .it would be unwise for a person who is good in athletics to switch to an academic profession .it would be an uncalculated risk and one is bound to fail .it is better to bank upon what one knows than venturing out towards the unknown .this is not to say that there arent any entrepreneurs who havent been successful , they have been successful because they have done something no one has done before , found something that works .but it is a matter of hard work and great bit of luck .there are many entrepreneurial ideas that never succeed and also several skilled people who arent successful , but the chances of a skilled person being successful is higher than a risk takers .the knowledge of a skill is very useful and definately the right use with hard work would result in success .also one must continously strive in their own field and keep upgrading themselves .if a person has not yet recognized his/her potential , then trying new things to find out what is suitable is a good idea .but leaving a reliable option to trying new things is not very safe and is not a garaunteed formula for success .if someone has a talent and does it well , then there arent many reasons for the person to fail except , of course , the skill or talent is dormant and of no use .for example , someone is excellent at washing clothes and washes them really well , but that skill will not be awarded because everyone washes clothes in a washing machine and so the skill is useless .so , one must only try new things and take risks if one does not already know how to do a certain thing well .it is then one must set out to self discovery and risk .
