it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do .some people think that young people are more enjoyable that older people because they have more strong body to enjoy life .however , i strongly believed that older people enjoy their life for the following two reasons ; they have a lot of time and money , they have less responsibilityfor the society .to begin with , older people are more live than only three decades before .they have more chance to attend an activities .also , they have a lot of time and money rather than young people .it will be a great opportunity for older people to enjoy life .for example , lots of activities center such as ymca are crowded of older people .they get together in that place and learning other activities such as ballet , yoga , swimming and card game .also they are spend a lot of money to travel abroad .since they had no time when they were young because they focused on their own jobs .they might be a less opportunity to travel abroad .dong-a , mosr popular travel company in korea , shows the evidence .in 2005 , traveling abroad older people are two times that young people .the criterion was over 60 ages .thus , older people are usually enjoy their life .on top of that , older people have less responsibility in their children and society .that is because almost they are not working reguarly and their children are growed .this means older people have less responsibility that young people .for example , i can see my grandmother who enjoy her own life .she is a important role in her community , getting together for friendship , and she has lots of clubs such as golf , dace and music .i this she really enjoys her life after working in a public department .she had been working for a public dapartment fo 30 years .at that time she never had a opportunities to enjoy her life .however , recently she seems too young better than my mother .thus , older people have less responsibilities of society and their chidlren , so they can enjoy their life .in summary , i strongly belive with the statements that older people are enjoy their life .that is because they have more money and time better that young people .also they have less responsibilities of society and their children .
