though some people think that it is more important for students to learn facts , i , personally , perfer that for students to understand ideans and concepts are more important for the following reasons .first of all , in the math class , it has a lot of formulas that we need to use when we are solving the problems .yet , some students just mermorize the formulas and they do not really understand why this formula comes out .therefore , they will confuse , when the questions change to which they are not familiar .in contract , students understand the idea and concept of the formula will help them easily to solve the questions .that is why most of math teacher spends a lot of time on teacing the concepts of the formulas .second , students will easy to forget , while they only know the facts ; because they only mermorize it .they do not know the idea or concept of the meaing .for instance , the computer programming is a very hard course to some people , and they memorized all the codes in the programming class and when they are typeing they only can type the basic stuff .if they meet a more complex question then they can not do it , and they will forget the code very soon , because they do not know how to use it .last but not least , the ideas and concepts are all made up from people .therefore , we can not just know the facts .once we get the concepts or ideas , we will very easy to know the whole things , and we do not need to study day and night for memorrizing whole books .although , this is not to say learning facts are without the merit , i firmly belive that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learn facts .
