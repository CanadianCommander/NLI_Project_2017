according to the statement it is difficult to decide it is rue or not .for my opinion there are students who spend most of their time in communities and on the other hand it gives people who did not spend any time for helping them .first i disuss the positive thing to helping communities .for example you are in a group of many people you have to listen to them and answer , you can talk about different topics .that is important for your future life , because in the job you need to talk in a group or highlight your personality .in the carrer life it is important for te boss that he know something from you .another thing is that helping our communities is a social aspect .a very good example is in our families .when we help for example our mother in the kitchen , she can help us in other things may be on doing our homeworks .when we do other things for somebody mostly we get an good advice back .that helps us also in our later life .but on the other hand there are lots of people in our society that have no time and no attention of our communities .may be they work too long and than they can not meet an community .or some people mostly the younger ones did not helping them because they think that is too boring .i think when they read the statement they think only about old people to help them .but more and more younger ones join in a group to talk together about different problems or things .in my opinion i think that are too many people have less time to join and helping people .but it is for their own help and for their own life .when they try it i think they are finding the thing good .finally it is good in our society that it gives people whe ; like thi and other ones .
