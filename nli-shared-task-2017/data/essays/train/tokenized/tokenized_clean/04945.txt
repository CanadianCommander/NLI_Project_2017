nowadays students do nt want to do too much effort learning topics .despite that thought , i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than simply learn facts .one of the reasons for students to clearly understad ideas and concepts is motivation .if sudents understand ideas and concepts they will get motivated .for example , in anatomy class students should understand how the digestion process is done .later on , they will be able to understand the importance to eat healthy .even more they will be encourage them to eat less bad foot and increase the healthy food .the students understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eat healthy .another reason for students to understand ideas and concepts is easier to learn when people understand concepts .i remember when my professor explained to me how the heart works .first he gave me the example how a water system works .also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system .at that time i was able to learn how is the heart s work .finally undertanding concepts and ideas students can increase their creativity .most of the people who has discoverd new inventions have understood the concept and the idea how things work .for example , people had to undesrtand the concept how the wheel worked in order to invent the cars .after that their creativity increased and the final product was the car .in conclusion , student who know in deep concepts and ideas are able to perform easier in any field because their motivation , learning and creativity will make them to apply his knowlege in any task in life .
