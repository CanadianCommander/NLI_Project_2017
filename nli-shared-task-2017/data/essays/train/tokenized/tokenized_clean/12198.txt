ever since i have been introduced to the learning system in our country , i have been always faced with two approaches while learning : the american approach versus the french approach to deliver knowledge .whereas the french system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic , the american way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic .but the question is : which one is the best ?here lies the `` chicken first or egg first problem  .some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject .this way , the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it .as an example , if i want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on , i would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it .while this approach is followed by many , others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts .in other words , by being exposed to facts , students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated , leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient .in other words , if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above , instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on , the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject , thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea .i emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts .i can still remember the effect s power that a fact will leave on students , at least on me when i was back at the university .i was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas .
