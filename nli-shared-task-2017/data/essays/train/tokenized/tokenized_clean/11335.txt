i agree with this statement .i have three reasons which can support these statement .first , recently in there are some severe enviroment problem in the world .it is grobal warming and air polution .to solve these problem many country start not to rely on cars as much as they can .for example , they try to make good transportation .some country has low to support reduce the car .in canada a car which ride on more than three people can use road for bus and tracks .peaple do not get in the traffic jam if they are on this road .second , nowadays some countries are growing , like china , india and asian countries , and african countries .growed countries has good transportation .come to think of tokyo , new york and london , there are so many subway s lines .growing countries have so many populations .if they have good transportation so many people use subways and they do nt need to use cars .third , because of aging sosiety , young peaple become less and people who can drive a car will be fewer .in the future car demanding become fewer little by little and car s price become expensive .such car people ca nt buy .i think old people use transpotation .these reasons why i agree .
