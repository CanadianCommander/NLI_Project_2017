in twenty years the number of cars will be even larger than the number of cars that we have nowadays .there are many reasons to think this , the most obvious one is that technology wont be able to create a substitute for the car in only twenty years .there are other reasons that are more human , like dependency .in twenty years cars will not be as bad for the enviroment as they are today but the number of cars will increase noticeably .in the last century technology has changed our way of living , one of the most important inventions was the car .who can imagine what would happen if suddenly all the cars in the world disappear ?it woul be a caos , the level of dependency that we have on cars is very high , we need them .cities are built in a way that life without a car is like hell , almost impossible .distances are longer and roads are made for them .but the main reason is on technology , cars are now starting to use electricity as their source power ( even tough they use gas too ) but this improvement does nt help to the problem of the number of cars .because there will be cars that do not use gasoline but they will still be cars .the united states is the model for the world and cities there are really wide , cars are really needed , american families have a minimun of two cars .so as the world gets `` americanized  more cars will be used .we also have to note the human incapacity to find an alternative .there are alternatives but none of them is perfect .we can use buses or trains but in order to use a train or bus you have to go to the station and it will not leave you at the exact point where you want to go .some people can say that riding a bike is the solution , but let s be real , are people going to ride a bike when they can go five times faster using a car ?without getting tired !!!bikes are the ideal solution but our human condition makes us lazy and consequently the bicicle option disapears .maybe in the future the cars will fly , that would solve a lot of problems , but it is not something that will happen in the near future .in conclusion , we will have to wait more than twenty years to see the number of cars decrease , and a radical change on our society or technology has to happen in order to this to occur .
