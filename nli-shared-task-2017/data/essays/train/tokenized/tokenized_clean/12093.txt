with progressing generations comes the progression of ideas .it is commonly said today , that the young generation is very ignorant of what s happening in its communities .but i do not believe that this statement is always true .the mindset of the young generation is highly influenced by its predecessors .i belive that it is upto the community and the parents ( that is , the older generation ) to instill the values of helpfullness and service in their children .i would like to illustrate the above , using my own experiences as an example .i have lived in india all my life and service done by children is not as rooted into the culture as it is in singapore where i know live .since the very beginning , even when i wa sin india , my parents always taught me to helpful not only towards my family and friends but also the environment and the community .ven when i was in india , i was one of the few kids who went to old age homes to work with the elderly or try my hand at teaching the poor kids how to read .and these valeus were embibed in me by my parents and hence , my parents were responsible for framing my mindset .i belive that this culture is more prevelent in singapore .walking across the street , one often comes across a young boy helping an old who s trying to cross the road .there are various programs in singapore that encourage the youth to help the less privelidged children , help the elderly or the sick in hospitals .some time back , i cam across an advertisement that asked for students volunteers to offer some of their time to playing with sick children in the `` national university hospital  of singapore .the icing on the cake was the long list of names of young people from all over singaproe who were willing to do this .hence , i belive that the above examples , beautifully illustrate that its not always the young people who do not give time to the community .if the virtues of service and helpfullness are instilled by the community in them , as in the case of singapore , the young people can be extremely caring and helpful .
