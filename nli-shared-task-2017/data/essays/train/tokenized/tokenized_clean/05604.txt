i would like to start by stating that i fully agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i will present three arguments that support my opinion .firstly i would like to explain that a good advertisement always has the best picture taken of the item marketed .for example , when you go to the fast food restaurant you usally rely on pictures to decide what you are going to eat .the nice pictures tempt your appetite and make you salivate .but when you actully receive the end product , like a macdonald s hamburger , it never looks as nicely constructed as the picture showed it would be .a nice picture can speek a million words .my second argument is that most advertisements are performed by very good looking individuals or endorsed by someone famous .to utilize such powerfull individuals will influence what you think of the item advertized .for example , if jessica simpson says that the leading acnee medication is proactive and that she uses it herself , then it must mean that it is an exeptional product because she is very rich and famous and can decide to use any product she wants .we trust the people we look up to or wish we could be .my last argument is that a good advertisment and brilliant marketing will undoubtebly bias our own personal experience .who can actually tell which product is a brand name if it has no label on it .if i were to blindfold you and have you taste 10 different macaroni and cheese could you pick out which one is the real kraft dinner ?an advertisement is very brilliantly constructed to attract consumers .i truly believe that we are all influenced , at some level , by cleaver advertisement and that we can all admit that we have been suckered into the latest gimmic at some point .we might not admit it to others though !
