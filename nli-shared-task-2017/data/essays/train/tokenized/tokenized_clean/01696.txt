the statement refers to a very impotant and also problematic question in our modern society as traffic and connected to that environmental pollution increses .at this point of time in history it is in my oppinion difficult to make such a prognose about the future because technological progress accelerates .as a consequence we can not know what and more important when a new vehicle will be invented which is able to partially substitue a car .according to me their will not be fewer cars in twenty years because the present trend of increasing car numbers and traffic does not change its direction .cars have been an essential invention in the past and are now an important part of our daily life .this is shown bz the fact that especially in the industrialized countries nearlz everz family has one or more car .we use the car to go shopping , to go to work , to go on vacation and often just to visit a friend a few streets away .with the invention of cars humans mobility increased .as nowadays a life without a car is hard to imagine and unsubstituable i think also in twenty years this fact will not have changed .on the one hand cars have simplified many things in our life and increased our mobility , but at the other hand have contributed to many environmental problems such as the emissions of carbon dioxide which damages the oyone lazer and contributes to global warming .government has made restrictions and laws to control the use of cars like taxes and there might be stricter laws in the near future but in my opinion it will take more than twenty years for the people to react to such laws .even if oil resources become scarce and oil prices will raise an adaption to this will be very slow .a reduction of car use when oil prices raise will in my opinion only be short term .as a conclusion you can say that according to me in the near future there will not be fewer cars because cars have become an unsustitutable part of daily life .as pollution increases the reduction of cars will be necessary to reduce environmental destruction but this will perhaps be achived in in more than twenty years .
