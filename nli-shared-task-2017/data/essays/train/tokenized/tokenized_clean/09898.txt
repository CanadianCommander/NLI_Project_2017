we can see any kinds of advertisements on tv .some of them are creativity and make the products look useful .what is the purpose of the advertisement ?we can understand in following reasons .first , customers is willing to buy the product after watching the advertisement .second , give the customers enough information about the product in a short time .third , there are many competitions in the same kind of product .even though the sales understand their product is good , customers will never know that if they never buy it .all they can do is to show their products in advertisements .although sometimes it seems much better than they really are , it is just strategy .other companies also use the same way .we all know that if the advertisements want to be watched as many viewers as they can , we should put it in the popular programs .it costs a lot of money .if we can not give customers enough information about what the product is , it just wastes money .the best way is to pretend it is really attractive and useful .sometimes customers do not understand what the difference between one company s product and others  products is .the only difference is the advertisement .every company tries to make their product look better than they really are .in conclusion , although i would like to buy the product better than it shown on advertisment , i do not how to choose the product if i have never used it .i will choose the product in a good advertisement .i agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
