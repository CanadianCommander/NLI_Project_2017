i partially agree with statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .they are more after creating a comfortable niche for themselves even if it may demand seclusion from the community they came from .but the scenario is slowly changing .the first thing which may be useful to analyse is the focus of the young people today .where are they looking themselves after 10 years of their study ?will their work help the community they come from ?today s generation is more interested in high profile jobs which will help them earn more .these are areas like software programming , telecommunications , research labs etc .very few people are today interested in taking up positions in the non govermental associations which work for the community on a no profit basis .also , it has been noticed few people actually want to become professors at universities and this has even led to the shortage of faculty at certain educational institutes .thus there is a slow drift from the jobs which actually work for the community .some people may argue that an indian researcher at microsoft research is contributing to the community besides a comfortable life also .but the bigger question is if the new technology built by him be available to the indian below poverty line and that too at a easible cost .clearly no .thus , if young need to contribute to their community through their work , the work must be focussed and not just a pretence for such an argument .most of the young after completing their graduate education take up the lucrative job offers abroad .these includes high profile banking jobs , research lab positions , or even the jobs that are similar to that in their own country but are `` abroad  .these people , the non resident citizens ( nrc ) then give grants to the government and feel satisfied that they have done their bit towards the community .but actually a large fraction of this money goes directly into the pockets of a few corrupt politicians .the money could have been well utilized if the nrc could have come down to his own country , spent some time there and looked after the utilization of his grant .but that is the foremeost question .the generation today does not have `` time  .the mindset of the young clearly needs to be changed .on the other hand , many institutes around the world today have realized this need of students having to contribute to the society that actually built them .for example , the indian institutes of technology have started a scheme where it is the part of curriculum of the student to actually spend some time doing some service to the society .this includes going in the schools and taking classes , working for better living conditions by taking up sanity projects in the nearby underdeveloped colonies .though the students were intially skeptical towards scheme called the national service scheme , but now they have realized the importance of this work and are coming forward to take up various projects .such schemes if implemented , can bring about the changes in the attitude of the young .focussed more on career , the young generation today is losing its focus from contributing to the society they have actually come from .they tend to delve into the comforts of their own lives that helping the community around them .this has to change if society needs to progress .however , many attempts in various parts of the world have initiated this process of changing the mindset of the young and have been successful .the young have now started to realize their responsibilities and to share with the community what it has given to them .
