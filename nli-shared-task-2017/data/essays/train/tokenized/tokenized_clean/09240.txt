i disagree with the statement .if anything , there will be a lot more cars in twenty years .first of all , according to what i have learned in school , oil is not a renewable energy source , but there is definately enough of it to meet global demands for at least the next fourty years , if not more .second of all , the number of cars has been increasing since they were first invented around the early twentieth century .so according to this trend , i do nt see how the number of cars will suddenly drop within two decades .the reason this statement is even debatable is probably because of the fact that oil is a non-renewable energy source so some people may think that it will eventually run out ( which it will , but not within twenty years as the statement says ) and we will have to find or invent different means of transportation that do nt require oil .but as long as oil is around and accessable , the number of cars will continue to increase .car companies - like bmw and land rover for example - are doing everything in their power to increase sales .they re giving better offers , their increasing the quality of manufacturing and they re meeting public demands .as long as they can keep their customers content with their products , which they have been doing since their companies are flourishing , the number of customers will only increase .i honestly do nt see how the public will just stop buying cars for the sake of it .they have nt stopped for the past ten decades , why will they stop in the next two ?i have absolutely every reason to believe that the number of cars will continue to increase as they have always increased , for the next thirty or fourty years , till oil eventually runs out .a car is probably the most important mean of transportation today .if oil runs out , another energy source will just have to replace it .if it does nt , then yes , perhaps the number of cars will decrease .but i disagree with the statement because i believe that the number of cars will continue to increase for well more than twenty years therefore the number of cars will not be fewer , they will be greater in twenty years time .
