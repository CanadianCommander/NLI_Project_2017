many people today use cars for transporting , going shopping and etc .as the society is developed , people use car more and more .so i do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .first , many people who have not car will buy a car when they earn a lot of money .as world economy is increasing , many people will have money which could be used to buy a car .secondly , in the future people will like traveling more than these days .then , people need a car .in conclusion , i believe that there are many cars in the future .
