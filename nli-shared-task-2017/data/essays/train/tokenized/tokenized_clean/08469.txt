people often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new things and tasks rather than doing one things they can do well .first of all , those who are changing constantly can succeed now .some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many things .however , it is now not available .nowadays , everything is so fast and complexed .so people can easily feel boring at same thing .for example , as many people know , the rock group ` radiohead  is still popular .they have been singing for more than ten years .there were many popular rock groups at that time .radiohead changed their music style and challenged new things that people have never heard .if they had stock to their one style of music , they could not have continued their populization .furthermore , challenging new things and face new tasks are more exciting and refreshing .only doing onething makes people feel boring and lazy .people who are lazy can not be better than those who are exciting to do something .suppose that you have to eat hambuger everyday .even if the hambugers are delicious , you would be sick of having same food .moreover , while people challenge new thing people can learn new skill .we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well .also we need to try many things because , nowadays , we need many skills .in the past time , the world was not large for people .it was local society .however , we can not succeed with only one skilled ability because the world are huge and complicated .if you know that how to use computers , then you need to try something else .it will give you new skills and more oppotunity to succeed .talking all of things into account , it is sure that successful people tend to challenge new things and face new risks rather that only doing one thing because it is more efficient , refreshing and skillful .
