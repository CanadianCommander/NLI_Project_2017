i disagree with this point of view .nowadays with the fast development in medical field , social environment and the advanced concept towards the good old days , more and more older people are enjoying the pleasure of the daily life and the proportion of older ones keep on rising in recent years .older people as well as young people are enjoying the improving life .first , i think older people have more leisure than young people .young people have to struggling to get enough money to maintain a life in the daytime and go on to study in the night colleges and other training system , which provide them with the technics necessary for their work .in contrast to them , old people do nt need to go to the company everyday to strive for money due to the funds supplied by the government and they do nt need to be punished by bosses for not finishing the work properly .what they need to do is just to lie in the sofa , watching tv or go to meet the former companions and call on at friends  houses .what a wonderful life !second , older people gain happiness by thinking about what they have acheived during the adult time .but the young have no time to consider this and they are experiencing failure everyday .therefore , they are surrounded by pains , sorrows and any ohther unpleasant things , which constantly appear .the older have no risk to compete with others , leaving the young people to be engaged in the competitive world .last but not least , the old ones enjoying the care given by their sons or duaghters .in china , every child , when growing up , must commit the responsibility to look after their parents .their children will bring money , fruit or other wonderful things to the old but they themselves have to spend time teaching their own little chdren .generally older people enjoy almost everything given in the old days .as the whole environment is improving rapidly , more and more older people will realize what an excellent life we have received .
