i absolutely agree with this statement .in my point of view nowadays young people enjoy life more than older people do .this is due to the fact that life standards have changed a lot .young people have more possiblities to spend their time in several ways , whereas old people do not have this possibility .moreover old people do not enjoy doing a lot of things .whereas young people like to do sports , go to cafes and just sit there , go to clubs and dance and do a lot of funny things , old people mostly get bored of those things .i see the old peope in my environment , like my grandparents .they are sitting all the day at home and do nothing than watching tv or reading newspaper .they do nt like to talk a lot and they just want their calm , one ca nt be loud around them .they have reached all their goals in their lifes and have nothing special or important to do .they got a lot of time , but they do nt spend it doing nice stuff .in my experience young people just have to do something , they do nt like it to sit at home all the time and do nothing , it s the most boring thing for young people .their lifes are just uncompleted , they have to make experiences in every case of life .because of this they see life different than old peole do .young people want to live life , they have to reach several goals , like graduating school/university , getting a good job and having a good career .because of this they live life different .moreover the environment has changed , young people have more possibilities to do anything , like going to clubs and dance or different sport activities .because they re young they want to have something like an adventure in their life , so they spend their time different , trying several things and spending their time useful .in this case i can talk about myself .i like it to try new things , evereyday is a new possibility for me to receive something new , to make a new experience , to learn more for my life .because old people have done most of these things during their youngness , they do nt have a lot of fields of interest .even if they have special interests , they ca nt do much stuff , being old is hard , so their body is nt strong enough for a lot of activities .old people get tired quickly and because of this they do nt like to do anything hard .they mostly even do nt know how to spend their time .in this case young people have luck , they mostly can do everything they want to and they purely enjoy it .i m sure when i am old i wo nt enjoy life .in my opinion being young is the best thing which can happen , because everything is than possible .
