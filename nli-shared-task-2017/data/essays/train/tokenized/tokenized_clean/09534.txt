to be successfullin my opinion succes is not same for all people .it can change in which are it is gained and people have different feelings about the area which they are successfull in .however ; for me it is true that successfull people can do the best while they are trying new things and if they take risk although the area which the success is gained changes from person to person .this is true because of three reason .first of all , successfull people used to working and studying and they wonder what happened around them .thus , they try different things which they wonder .for instance , the engineers of a big company always try to find new products to sell .in other saying , the company is big because of successfull engineers .the engineers are successfull because they are not doing the usual work in company .they are trying to find new areas which they are not already know how to do well .secondly , successfulll people are interested in everything .they read different kinds of books , they watch different types of programms and as a result of this , they know so much about different ares .so they can find varios type of innovations .if we look at the researches in the world , people who have different looking to the problems or the events are generally successful in their job .thirdly , successful people try to solve problems with different solutions .the person who has a second solution for a problem usually successfull .this is because of their decides .a person who has a second or third solution means that he or she can take risk at least one time to solve the problem .take what i have mentioned above into consideration , success comes with trying new things , with interested in different areas and with taking risk .
