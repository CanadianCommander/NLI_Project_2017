i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .first , with the big developmemt of the technology traveling will be easier than tose days .actually with planes , trains , and cars people can be in their countries at the time they want .so if we return for twenty years ago we ll see how the people were travel in the past .there were nt cars or trains so they took days and months in traveling , for example , they used animals camels , horses and also donkeys .but now they used cars and planes so they saw that the life became more better than before .as we see , in the future people will try to make their traveling more easier than now .i think that they will discover new machines which is faster than the car .they ll try to get their life more easy and comfort .may be they will try new trains which connect the word together from west to the east .in addition what will happen if thae cars fill all the streets in one city ?it will cause many problems for examples polluiton on the air .as aconclusion , in my opinion in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
