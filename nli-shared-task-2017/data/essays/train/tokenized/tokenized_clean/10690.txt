nowadays , it is said that youngsters are not giving efficent time to help their communities .it could be partially true when we are looking at their lifestyles which are fully scheduled with a lot of academic studies and other physical activities but as long as i am concered with this issue , children these days are more contributed to their societies because of these reasons : higher accessibility and the way of getting credits .to begin with , it became much easier than ealier times for young people to get the access of the information to work for their communities .in my time , when i wanted to have volunteer job in the library in my home town , i had to visit every libraries in the town so as to find out if it is available or not .however , nowadays , the computer network enables everything to connect so easily so chidrens could surf the internet to find appropriate information about finding out the organizations or communities which are in need of help .in addition , now it is becoming an essential for students to have volunteer record so to get higher credits which are needed for them to go into better schools .until before 1990s in korea , it was unneccessary for children to get social service credits , but now it has spread to all over the country to let the children work for their society and give them certifications which proves certain amount of time that they served for their communities .whether they are willing to take the work or not , they have to make their contribution to their society and this made a lot of student became more involved in the social service work .to conclude , even though children have to spend tremendous time for study their own , they also work for their communities because they can get much more information about volunteer job openings than before through surfing the internet , and also , anyway , they have to work in order to gain higher credits on social service which is vital these days to get into famous universities .
