i do nt support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject .therefore i think that beeing professional means that a person has to acquire many theorical concepts at the beginning of his carrier , but he has to grow his specific skills in his major during the job-s life .during my life i found many reasons that bring me on this idea .first of all , a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goals .infact , when someone does nt care about nothing in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets .the time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general .second , be focused in a specific knowledge s area does nt enhance more problems , otherwise more alternatives .i really believe that there are many aspects in every subjects and everyday we have to make your best choice .for instance , when a student is improving his skills on many matters it is more possible that he will fail in one of those , than onether guy who is learning about only one subject .flexibility is nt a synonim of the dispersion of personal ideas .personally , when i graduated two years ago i chose where i would like to work , in which sector and what will be my goals .i really appreciated the advices of my parents whose suggested me to find a general job to be able to change it in the future .anyway , i preferred to be focused on my major .now i am gratifyied by my decision and i will suggest the same to my friends that are still studying .for those reasons i discourage everyone to have broad knowledge .
