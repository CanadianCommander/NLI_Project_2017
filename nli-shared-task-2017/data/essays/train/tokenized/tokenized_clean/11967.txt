as technology has been developed , many jobs and skills have been created .for example , bill gates who is the richest in the world and have company that related to computer program .history of the company that named ` microsoft  is shorter than others .but bill gates knew what will the important things become in the world .and not many people tried to these new part .that was easy client of computer .he invented easier client .and he spread out to average user .i think that , like this example , trying new things is better way to become successful people than only doing what they already know how to do well .here is some reasons .first of all , there are less rivals in new things .for example , there were already a lots of coffee shops .so many investers struggled to make extraordinary shops .and also thet have to care location of shop and menu .because there are rival shops .but if someone try to new thing , he do nt have to care about the rival .as i stated about bill gates , when the new company developed new things , there were any rivals .they did nt worry about challenging with other companies .so bill gates concentrated on his new things .secondly , only doing what they already know how to do well is more dangerous than try new things .as the age has been changed , important things are changed .for example , long times ago , laundry was very important .because laundry machine was expensive and hard to manager .so many people used laundry shop .but nowadays many company invented new and easy laundry machine .so many people have laundry machine in their house .and also many owner who have laundry shops had to closs his shop .for that reason , only doing what they already know how to do well is dangerouse for their work .because world trend has been changing .for those reason , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
