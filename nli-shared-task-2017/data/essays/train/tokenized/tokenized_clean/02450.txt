enjoying life depends on a decision and not on a the age or the circumstance that a person is going through .i have known many old people who are happier and healthier than many teenagers and adults .i know , for example , a 60-year-old woman who has more energy than two teenagers together .i might be exaggerating , but her attitude toward life impresses me a lot .she swims every day , she goes to the beauty parlor all the weekends and she has her own business .in fact , she told me last time that she won the first place in a 2000-meter swimming competition in the atitlan sea .she is also the most hyperactive person that i have ever known .she likes to joke and she is smiling everytime i look at her .on the other hand , i know a 30-year-old man who always wakes up tired and upset and who hates his job .when i go to visit him , he is either eating or watching tv .i sometimes do not like to talk to him , because he is always speaking negatively .his bad attitude sometimes scares me .because of this two examples given , i believe that enjoying life does not depend on someone s age .i am sure that the woman , whom i wrote about , wakes up every day expecting something new and that she is thankful that she has a new day to experience .she has a possitive attitude and she is the one who decides to have a special day .the other man could have a terrible job and a terrible house , but if he wants and decides to make of them something pleasant and enjoyable , he will make a paradise out of it .it conclusion , i disagree with the statement .happiness depends on the person s attitude and decisions .
