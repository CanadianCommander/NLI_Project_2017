both our planet and our way of life have evolved throughout the decades , and we can notice several major shifts during the last century for instance .one great invention was the rather recent creation of cars and this event has strongly influenced our daily life .however , for several reasons , i am convinced that in the next twenty years , the use of cars is going to decrease a lot .for a very long time , mankind has not taken care of the environmental health and state .indeed , in every countries , the citizens have polluted their beaches , their plains , their air etc .when cars appeared , this phenomenon actually spread until today , so that the situation is rather critical nowadays .nevertheless , in recent times , many international and political leaders such as kofi annan the un secretary for instance ; many international organizations like the united nations , wwf or green peace , have criticized these wrong habits and try to promote a better way of life , without cars .thus , i think that many people among the citizens have realized that they all had a major role in their planet s health and they might indeed respect the advices of the ecologists organizations , by using their car less for example .moreover , in many countries , several political leaders have conducted a special policy based on the development of public transports such as bus , plane , train etc .they have decided to decrease the costs of these infrastructures , they have invented special cards at lower costs for the students , the elderly , for instance so that they tend to use these transports rather than cars .besides , specialists in urbanism in many major cities such as new york , paris etc have developed the network of these structures so that always more people can use them .finally , on an economic scale , because of the wars , the tensions in the countries that belong to the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , the prices of oil have increased up to more than 70 dollars per barrel .given that cars mostly use oil today , many consumers try to decrease their consumption of oil , and as a consequence , they tend to use much less their vehicles .if the prices of oil keep increasing , which in my opinion will be the case ( fewer new wells of oil are discovered today in the world ) , i am certain that this will reduce the expansion of cars .as a conclusion , i would say that i am convinced that there will indeed be fewer cars in about twenty years , whether it be for economic , political or environmental reasons : the domination of cars has come to an end !
