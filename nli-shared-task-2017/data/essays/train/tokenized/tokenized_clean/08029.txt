learing is a complex process .it includes understanding ideas , concepts , learing process , and getting the facts .there are discussions about which is more important during the learing process .i think it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than just to know the facts .as is known to all , during learning , we should not just care about the results , we should also care about the important ideas and concepts underlying the results .we should make clear that we know how we can get the results , that s how we can go through the understanding ideas , integrating concepts , and making derivarition to get the results .nowadays , because of the study competition , students care much about the grades they can get .during study , sometimes , they just want to get the right answer without knowing why it comes to this not another .sometime , they even just memorize the results as to get the right marks in the test .this is contradictory with the real goal of learing .facts are important , but the ideas and concepts we should learn through the process of getting facts are more important .so the students should not just satisfied with the right facts , they had better pursue the right process through which we can get the right answer .learing prepare us the backgrounds , knowledge and technology for our future work .this includes the ideas and concepts those are strongly confirmed .the facts are just one kind of methods to help us understand ideas and conepts better .the facts for different situations are different .even we know the right facts at this time , if we ca nt master the methods and technology gaining from the basic ideas and concepts which are used to get the facts , we wo nt get success in our future work .in future practical conditions , everything is new , every problem is like a stranger to us .we ca nt use the facts we memorized before to get the conclusion , we should try our best to use the ideas and concepts we have mastered to get the new conclusions .in conclusion , i think it s more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it s for them to learn facts .
