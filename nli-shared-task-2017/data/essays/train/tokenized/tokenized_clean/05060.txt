there is a public controversy nowadays that whether we should decrease our car-use in the following twenty years .differnt people have different views due to their individual angles .the people who prefer to drive the car holds the opinion that the industrial development needs transportation by using cars .but some person think these vehicle will pollute our environment , so the country should limit to use cars as traffic tools .as far as i am concerned , i would absolutely choose the latter opinion .i would reason and provide convincing examples to support my viewpoint as follows .the foremost reason we can not deny is that the whole world s evironment become worse gradually .the industrial development without careful consideration caused problems even worse than we can imagine .the whole country overflowed by pollutions like the white pollution , nosie pollution , the air pollution and light pollution .and many amout of them are caused by using cars .and those pollutions will threat our health .also the increasing cars burn fuels larger than ever before , the energy in the whole world is decrease fastly .maybe in few years , we could not use fuel to move our cars .the reason why i casts my preference for cars decreasing is that a lot of specises have already extincted .because they can not accommodate themseleves to the changing living conditions .as a undergraduate students majored in life science , i will do something for those living creatures .so i hope we can find some other vehicles to take but not cars which will produce toxic output .therefore i always take my short trip by cycling instead of traveling by cars .of couses , there are some merits by using cars .but the advantages and the disadvantages of using cars are carefully compared .we can see clearly that protecting our enviornment outweigh the advantages of using cars .all in all , consider all supports pointed above , we can ratinoally see that deceasing the car use is very important of our dailylife .
