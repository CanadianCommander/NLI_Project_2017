i totally agree with this statement .there are lots of advertisements in the world .all the advertisements about their goods contains the great exaggeration about their goods .in my experience , i was young and i was in korea , i watched the advertisements about new robot toys .at that time on the tv , it shows the flying robot that i can control it and make it fly .i was really surprised about flying thing because i was young .so i bought it at my birhday and tried to make it fly .it did nt fly .it was really big shock for me and i could not believe any advertisement from that time .in our life , we can see many cases like mine .in addition , i saw a advertisement about new restaurant , it says that if we come at birthday , it is free and there are alot of beneficial thing for birthday people .so i went to that restaurant with my friends on my birthday , i expected that free foods and many things .but i could nt get any services or beneficial things .they said , it was only one week event so i checked the advertisement paper , it did nt mention about one week event .i was really angry but i could nt leave that restaurant .in my opinion , we can not stop them .because it is one of the good way to make people come to their restaurant .but we can think ourselves that we know it is fake .so do not expect that much , we have to get ready for a shock .when we just do nt believe the advertisement , we can have some benefit luckily , and it makes us happy .so my conclusion is , we know it is not really true but we can just go and have fun there .
