i think that the question to either have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects or to have a good and specialised understanding in one subject is a difficult one .i agree with both of the points to some extent .first of all , it is important for a younger student to have a broad knowledge of many subjects .schools , in particular primary and secondary schools should try and give their students a broader overview of many subjects .this is also important in the younger years of a students life , because most of the students have not decided what they will do in their future life .they are not really sure what they are really interested in and in what area they want to specialize .when it comes to secondary schools , students should be given their first choices , based on the knowledge they haev already obtained .they should be able to limit their subject choice and cut down on the number of areas where they have to study in .of course , this would also result in deepening the knowledge in the subjects chosen .when it comes to the last two to three years of school for students , they should be given lessons in only the six to seven areas they are really interested in .whereas , i think that certain subjects do not even have to be taken .currently , mathematics , german , a second language , history or politics and biology , chemistry or physics have to be studied .i think this is not needed , as different students of course have different strength , not only in life , but also in their academics .i have attended a german `` gymnasium  until year 10 , where we were not able to make any choices whatsoever .studying 16 to 18 subjects was not an exception .i have also attended an australian school , only studying 5 subjects .the coice was widely open and no mathematics or languages or any subjetcs were required to be able to do your exams at the end and gain university entrance .however , for certain university courses , students also had to take certain school courses .one such example would be medecine , where students had to have biology and chemistry , as well as taking the umat test , to see if they are suitable for such a course and also later on such a job .i think this is a successful approach for students , which not only gives them the motivation they need in school , but also the requirements to successful results at the end of their school time .on the side , we also have university students who have to be taken under consideration .of course they are a different matter altogether .i hold the opinion that the less subjects they take and the deeper they go into details in their study , the better it is .at the beginning of a three to four year study period for their first degree in that area , university students should get a bit of a broader overview of the area for one to two semesters .in that period of time , they get the time needed to see what specifically they want to do and with what exactly they want to continue .the rest of the remaining study period , university students should be prepared for exactly the field they are interested in and want to get a working place later on .this is neccessary to make sure that every one of the students is really good at what they are doing and can prepare well for their choice of job .this would give the university students not only more choices from which they can choose their courses , but it would also prepare them better for what they will do later in their life .it would also be a positive criteria for employers when they take people , because then they can be sure that they know what the person is doing and that the person knows as much as possible about what he or she is doing and also the background information that is needed .time and money is saved as well , as people come into the workforce and do not have to get an introduction how everything works over a long period of time .therefore , i would say that there is not a totally clear answer to the question , but the tendency in the later years of education for me is towards a specialization in one , maybe two subjects .
