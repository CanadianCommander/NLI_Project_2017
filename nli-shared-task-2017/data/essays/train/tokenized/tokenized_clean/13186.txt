since the middle of the 20th century the number of cars on our earth has been increasing rapidly .but is this trend going to last in the 21st century ( question mark !!! )there are several points why i suppose that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .taking into account that the natural resourses like oil will definitly come to an end within the next decades and consequently the prices for fuel will increase drastically , i do nt think that normal people will be able to afford a car .in addition , not only the prices for fule might increase , but also car taxes and car insurance .even today , it is hard for most people to afford a car .another point is that in my opinion the puplic transportation in most cities will be more supported by government in the future .just think of the billions of euro the governtment puts into the transrapid .having a look at our cities , the limit for cars on the streets must have been reached by now .i can not imagine that there is space for even more cars , especially during rush hours .traffic jams and endless waiting is an every day image on germanys roads , the numbers of cars must decrease by any means in the future .best example for a car - abbanding policy can be witnessed in innsbruck , austria .there , the innercity gas pollution and noice pollution became too much .after voting against innercity traffic , the residents of innsbruck now have the opportunity to sit at the maria-theresien-strasse and enjoy their innercity atmosphere .in my opinion this example should be a guideline for germany and the rest of the western world as well .if politicians go on to refuse spending more money on the development of more economical cars and the discovering of alternative fuels , i m sure that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .if not man is clever enough to do something against wolrd pollution , environment will strike back some day .
