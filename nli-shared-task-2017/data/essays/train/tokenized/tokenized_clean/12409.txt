the statement , that advertisments tend to be too euphoric regarding the products value or effectivness , is an ofter heard observation from people consuming todays massmedia .the reason for a company to spend money on an advertisment is to make the product known to the public and to compete with their competitors on the market .if the advertisment is made for a new and innovative product , it is more likely a realistic view of the products abilities , than it is in case the product has to compete in a dense market of similar products .in the later case the consumer is alredy affected by the advertisments of other companys or even own experiences and therefore less likely convinced by a new product .depending on the market situation the product is facing , the advertisment has to be choosen by the advertiser .the statement , i am referring to , should be made more specific , as a general view on advertisments is not possible in my oppinion .another reason why advertisments can seem to be much to confident in a products value but actually are not , is the setting or story told in the advertisment .a vacuumcleaner in front of a beautiful landscape is somthing different from the same vacuumcleaner in a wardrobe .the product is the same only the viewers connection to the advertised product varies .sometimes it is the consumers imagination that lends him to the conclusion that advertisments are promoting a unrealistic picture of a product and not the advertisment itself .in the case of products intended to be used by a very young usergroup ( kids or teens ) the advertisments are more likly to present a better picture of the advertised product that reality would allow them to .the young consumers are more easily affected by such campaigns than older consumers , who tend to be more carefull when relaying on advertisments .the general understanding that advertisments ca nt tell the truth is wrong in my view , though the technique to present a product in a better light as it really is , is definetly in every advertisers toolbox .
