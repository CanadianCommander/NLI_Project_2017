today , the environment continues to play in increasingly important role in world politics .although , first steps have been made to reduce globl warming , the issue is still not treated with the earnesty and conviction it deserves so far .sadly i need to stress the fact , that this may pose a greater threat to civilisation than terrorism .cars contribute to global warming by emmiting co2 .consequently , the question wether there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years is of vital importance to us all .i would like to answer with a definite yes .however , i think otherwise .one of the main reasons for this conviction is , that people have known about global warming for a long time , but that consequent action , such as driving less has been taken only by a small minority .people love convenience , and cars are very convenient .moreover cars are very important symbols of status for many people .feelings have a greater influence on most people than rational thought , and this is why they will not give up their cars if they don not have to .another reason why i think that the number of cars will increase , is that large numbers of people in the so called third world , especially in china , who did not have cars so far , are starting to buy them .ony a drastic increase in petrolem prices could slow this developement .less pessimistic reasons for my view , are that new cars are beeing developed .these cars use less fuel , cosequently , they will be affordable , even if fuel prices should rise significantly .what is more , research has been trying to invent cars that do not use combustable fuels at all for quite a while .they will surely succeed in the near future .i do hope that if i am right , and we do have more cars on earth in twenty years , than we do today , that they will not emmit co2 .
