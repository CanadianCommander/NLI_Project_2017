definitly advertisements make products seem much better , they have to , otherwise who will be willing to buy products .the purpose of advertisements is intended to do so .i strogly agree with the statement , espeacially for selling their product , earn profits & so on .first of all , if the company has to sell a new product , they have to work on how to attract consumers .though the product may be not so good .for example , when i see an advetisement on any medication , espeatially for cold i look for how it is different from other medication & buy the medicine to try out , then it totally depends on me if i want to take it or not .secondly , buy making the advetisement look better from the product will help the company earn profit .if people are attracted by the ad then only they may buy the product .it will bring people to atleast give a try .that will benifit the company , but latter it all depends on how the product actually is .for instance , i saw an ad on weight loss program , using pills make you slim & trim .i was so attracted to it that i just wanted to go & try it out .i did , but when i took the medication with no diet control i lost so much weight , that was incredable .but once i stoped it i stared to gain weight .it was profitable for the company but not worked for me .not even that i gave suggestion to all my other friends too .but later realesed that it does nt work .by my suggession all my friends bought the product .to conclude , all ads are made attractive inorder to attract consumers & sell their products to earn money , but it boils down to one point that we have to decide to buy or not .your judgement is the best .every one sees thier own profit but we are at loss so be careful
