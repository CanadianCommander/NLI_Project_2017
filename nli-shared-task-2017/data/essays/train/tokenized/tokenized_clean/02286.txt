nobody can define what is life and what is enjoyment .life and enjoyment both have different meanings for different individuals .a person may enjoy their whole life .but it is not possible to avoid the pains and sorrows from life , because these are the part of everybody s life and comes at different ages .some pains are related to the age , like phisical problems .some people face age problem early in their life and some people face late in life .or we can say that some people become senile early , it depands on the situation which he faced in his life and it also depends on gene strecture also .i agree with this statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .one reason to support this opnion is that undoubtly the young person s energy leavel is high than the older one s .a young people is more enthusiastic than older people and enthusiasm is must to enjoy life .older people s energy will decrease as their age will increase , this is a basic bilogical principle .young person can travel and go whereever they want to go but it is not possible for a old age person because their body will not allow them to do so .another reason is that the physical problems will restrict the old peoples to do enjoyments , like they ca nt travel so frequently if they have problem of joints pain .they ca nt eat which they want to eat most because their medical prescriptions will not allow them to do so .old peoples ca nt take so much sugar in their food if they have the problem of diabetes .but a young person can easily eat what they want and they can easily digest that .they have no restriction on their food .and taking food of our preference is also a joy of life or we can say enjoyment .a young have no physical problen no joint problems so they can travel and go to adventures sites .a old person can not hold excitement because they have heart problems , so more happiness and more sorrow both are injuries to their health .but a young one can do lot of exciting things .in these way a young can enjoy life more than older people .
