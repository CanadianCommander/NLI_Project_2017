in the world that we live in , we can not afford the limitations that we state to our knowledge .this a personal barrier we unconsiously establish in our minds , limiting our personal objective s optimum results .we compete every day with more developed and evolutionized minds .qualities that a person may posses , may limit the desire to abroaden their studies .some determinations , obstacles or maybe the lack of interest may affect ones studies .setting and focusing the minds is an essential fact for abroading knowledge .determinations may hold one back , establishing olny to study what they are truly passionate to study .what people do nt see is that to have to optimmum product towards being the best at your passion , one must be prepared for everything and anything .obstacles may be presented at a road towards succes , but the key is to overcome the obstacles and learn from them , exposing every day the best of anybody .another thing is the lack of interest one may gain if the subject to study is of extreme boresome .it may be a teacher s fault that the subject is of dislike , there by causing the desire of the students to only study the specific subject and terminate the agony .i agree with the statement , `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects that to specialize in one specific subject ..i want to be a veterinarian , but to be successfull in the job i want to pursue , i have to study abroadly every academic subject i choose .this will prepare me to confront any obstacle that i may enconuter on the road to success .in conclusion , limiting our knowledge is not an option , one must always exceed the limits .this is the road to success , to be the very best one can be , knowing the most out of our knowledge .
