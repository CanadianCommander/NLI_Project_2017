ideas consist of facts , and the relation between the two concepts is of a complicated kind .indeed , when we read the statement , it seems natural to argue that understanding ideas is of a better use that to merely learn facts .the first is considered as such a noble and deep endeavor whereas the second is depicted as a narrow minded attitude .though we shall not come to conclusion of this kind in such a precaucious manner , and we will strive to analyse the question in a more thoughtfull way .since we would all , i presume , agree that understanding ideas is more important than learning facts , we should then rather that argueing in this sense , try to explain why this answer seems so obvious and natural .why then , would we all , certainly , tend to value the firts idea and not the second one .this a priori , that we all share derives from the fact that we strongly believe that the activity of learning facts requires less of an effort than the one of understanding .this belief is widely spread , and it is shared for many good reasons .understanding undoubtadly requires more time and concentration that the learning of facts .yet , most professions , now days , give more importance to acts then they do to thoughts and deepness .to pass this test , we are not asked to truely understand the questions that we are asked but simply to answer them in a superficial way .most of us have little or no knoledge of biology or of social science and yet , are goal is to sound like excperts and to bring exact answers .again , we are not asked to think neither about the question nor about the reason why we are here to pass the test , wich behavior would result in an immediate failure .but is society mistaken when it askes us to come to this center and pass the test ?no .because we should understand the importance of leraning facts .the two concepts meet when the understanding serves our goal .
