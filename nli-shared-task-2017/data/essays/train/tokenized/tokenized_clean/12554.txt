`` you can have any color you want as long as it is black  .this famous sentence from henry ford is the symbol of the beginning of the mass production of cars .before henry ford s use of taylorism , car production was linked with customization and very limited .since the 1920s the number of cars produced has increased exponentially .back then , there seemed to be a plethora of fossil fuels and nobody could ever imagine that cars could be one day an `` endangered specie  .nowadays , with the knowledge that fossil fuel is a finite resource , researchers are looking for alternative transportation ways or other energies .taking all aspects into account , i strongly believe however that in twenty years there will be as many cars in use than there are today .in this essay i will present the reasons why i believe so .first i believe that people will not renounce to use their car that easily and that quickly .since the 1970s and the first oil crisis , oil price have increased .this has had only few repercussion on people s use of cars .even in europe for instance , where consumers felt ( and are still feeling ) this increase in price , you can see many people commuting to work with their car .furthermore car is a really practical way to go from one place to another really quickly .people have gotten used to such an advantage which gives them a lot of freedom .second i believe that the solution of the problems does not lie in reducing the amount of cars .i believe that it rather lies in finding alternative resources .researchers are working hard on other energies , such as bio fuels .in germany for instance you can buy cars that are adapted to accept bio fuels .in france , a law has been passed on that subject allowing bio fuels to be sold .therefore i think that there will be as many cars , they will however use another energy .third i truly think that cars have become as necessary as a home in people s mind .having a beautiful car is a sign of wealth .it enables people to dream and to show off sometimes .some people invest in really expensive cars in order to belong to a certain class , even if it means that they will have to do some sacrifices .for many people , a car is a dream object .this positive image of car along with its role in the society ensure that in twenty years there will always be as many cars if not more .to conclude i think that cars will not disappear within the coming twenty years .even if there are problems that could cause the car to disappear , its importance on our society is such , that scientists will always look for solutions and consumer will always want to keep on driving .
