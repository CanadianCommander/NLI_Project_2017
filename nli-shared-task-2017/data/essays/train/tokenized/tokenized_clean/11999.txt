young guns of today are more determined then ever and the courage , the determination shown by this generation is by far greater .i dont agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .times have changed , but the will to be helpful to fellow communities has definitely not withered away .take for instance the various political parties both regional and national that have over the time being completely overpowered by youth domination .the youth movements like nsui , and various ngos have been recruiting bright students from top universities like jnu , delhi and the pace at which the students participate in the social activities is heartening to say the least .all these organisations of international stature involve community services that are more or less dominated by the young people .its a misconceived notion that youth dont give enough time for their communities but a deeper analysis shows that there are very good and educated people who have devoted to making their lives of some consequence to others .a study at the grass roots level namely the village panchayats and the muncipalities have gradually been the foundation grounds for future leaders of immense potential .many new ngos are being started by young people who are at times educated at top notch universities , india and abroad .they sacrifice their attractive career options to serve the people and make a difference .the youth have gradually tried to do their bit in the fields of literacy , improving sanitation , and provide better social and economic amenities in collaboartion both with government and private sector .in today s world globalisation is the word , what with the private sector and software boom providing immense career growth and are highly remunerative , inspits of this many young people are opting for a career in the civil services .thus , people especially youth are devoting adequate time and its high time the society takes note of it .
