i mainly agree with that statement .i think it is obvious that advertisements make products seem better than they really are , because this is what advertisements are there fore .the aim of advertisements is to make people buy the product .to succeed best in this , advertisements have to make the product seem as good as possible .now it is clear , that with some technical support , it is quite easy to make a product seem better than it actually is .for examle , advertisements often use very bright and shining colors , but if you compare the product with the picture , the real colors are much more ` normal  .furthermore , advertisements often use graphics , tabels or words that appear scientific to make the product seem more special , but if you know a bit about the facts displayed , you realize that they only tell very common things any other similar product also has .apart from making the products seem better , advertisements also use psycological means to make people buy the product .especially , they often try to implicitly convey a message without letting the customer really be concious about it .for example a laughing person on a photo makes people think using this product makes them happy .or they try to make it plausible to people that they absolutely need this product because they belong to a certain groop .so advertisements often specialise to reach a distinct group of people like young parents , elderly women or middle-aged men .however , i think , sometimes advertisements can also help to make a new product known or to inform people about special qualities a specific product has and how it can serve them .from a customer s point of view , i think a middle way is best : one should not completely mistrust advertisements because they can really draw one s attention to something useful , but on the other hand one should neither trust them blindly .from my experience i think it is best to either try the product , so you know if you want to buy it again or not , or ask someone who has already tried it for advice .
