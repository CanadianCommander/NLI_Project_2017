people today are faced with a stark choice as they can not decide to use their cars or try other ways to transport .having been a user of car for six years , i am well aware of its many drawbacks .it is very costly due to high oil prices and risky as many accidents happen .in addition to these , toxic gases from the cars pollute enviroments .due to all these reasons , i agree that car use will decrease in next twenty years .to begin with , oil prices will get higher as the source of oil on the earth will decrease and this will make using cars much more expensive .as result of this , people will choose to walk for shorter distances or use public transport in longer distances .these options are cheaper than using car .in additon to oil prices , parking price is another factor which increases cost of using cars .as cities will get bigger , number of parking spaces will decrase which will increase their price .in this way , many people will also choose public transport to avoid paying high parking prices .besides being costly , using cars is also risky as many people die or seriously injured in car accidents everyday .many people think that while using cars , they are under a serious risk of having accident .the reason of the crash or the carelessness causing crash may not always stem from you but you also get injured when the other driver has a fault .this shows that there is always a certain risk in driving car .in this way , planes will be mostly preferred in future as they offer a safer alternative .most importantly , cars pollute the environment as they release toxic wastes .these wastes cause air pollution which brings about serious lung diseases .in other words , when you use car , you cause deaths or illnesses of some people .therefore , in next years , as people will not be able to stop production facilities which are also an important air polluter , people will try to reduce the air pollution caused by cars .in this way , people may start to use bicycles which do not pollute the environment and additionally , is benefical for their health as provides regular exercise .for example , i have many friends who started to use bicycles for both his health and the health of posterity .to sum up , in next years , less people are likely to use cars as it is costly , risky and harmful for the environment .i think that most people are likely to use bicycles as it is cheaper and do not harm the environment .in this way , they can leave the clean air to the posterity .
