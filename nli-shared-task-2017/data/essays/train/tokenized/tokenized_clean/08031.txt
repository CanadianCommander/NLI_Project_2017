traveling in a group led by a tour guide is always my choice , if it s possible .as i experenced both types , traveling with or without a tour guide .a tour guide has its importance especially in new or dangerous places .much to said about the tour guide , simply he or she makes many things more easier and also responsible for manythings that may be time consuming or tiring .let s begin from the first , when a traveler arrives there .many world places have no clear maps or directions to get to the hotels .this makes the traveler exposed to thieves and fraud .if there is a tour guide , this problem does nt exist .also arranging the ransportation to the places of interest with good prices is always tiring and time consuming process .a tour guide has the enough local experience to get the best for his or her group .the best time to visit a place or to see something unique always does nt come by good luck but by good experience .local customes and traditions are usually hard to learn from books or magazines especially for people who comes from totally different cultures .a tour guide is very helpful in this point .some tourists found themselves involved in legal conflicts or troubles with local residents because they simply do nt know the local habits or traditions .a tour guide will not expose his or her group to dangers the strangers may not note easily .while strangers go around in popular markets , they are a chance to some local sellers to sell them false or unworthy articles and this happens more frequentley .a tour guide can be the advisor about buying local goods .there is also a human side for accompaning a local tour guide , he or she is as abridge for the two cultures as he or she experience both from his or her natural living and job .a tour guide can explain manythings that seem unsual , strange , or hard to hard to expalin .
