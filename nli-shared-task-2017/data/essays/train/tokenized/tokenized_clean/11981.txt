every human being in thecommunity have some responsible towards to the community .they can not only enjoys the things as community provides them .but also they can give enough time to spend on help to their communities .morenumber of engineering students produced during year by year .they can began to create new invention .the young per son invent the the computer .but the other young who learn thorough this subject introduce a internet .we can get more information through this internet .we can not specially mention those things .more more and advancrements these thing we can get every thing as eazarly as possible , but the cost constriant is also there .dotors find out new methods of surgery things .if a person seriously injured in accident , or fire work , or some other diseases , he can completly recovered in few days , not like unlike inold endayas .young people are learned the new things , thechanges that are occur in the surrounded world .they want help peeople .not only in educational field , they enter into the agricultural fields also .they ininvent new genetic trees , to produce more fruits to us .thus we can meet the need of the people .tthey goes to the rural areas when they get free time .they spend time with rural people to educating them .young ones enter into the spacce reseach also .through which we can get the information related our country not only iours but other countrys problemms are also solved .example tsunami is occur in chennai in india in past year , it create lot of destuction incity .but again tsunami come we can find out the reasons , areas these tsunmai gets exposed to .throughspaceresearch .earthquakes , weather report can be given by space research people .and there are more developements are made inthis .field .we step inthe moon .to get more usefull information to us .that s why i disagree with the sttement as young people donot give enough time to helping their community .
