good marketing strategies and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisements .they want to make the costumers thinking they buy the best product on earth , but sometimes the companys are cheating .in my opinion it s true , that most advertisements make products seem musch better than they relly are .the big bosses of the economy want to make the big money by selling a lot of their products .to reach their thoughts , they would nearly do everthing they could do .there are many reasons why the managers try to reach much more money .one is per example the stock market , which opens many people the possibility to be a shareholder of a company .they invest their money with the thougth to get more money back in an future time and so the put the manager under big pressure , because he s the man who has the investments of the shareholder in his hands .i think that many managers do nt want to be unemployed and so they starting to find the best ways of selling .some make their products without good quality , so that the costumers need a new one after using it a few times .the disappointment of this is , that the products are presented like unbreakable wonders which can change the world .this strategy gets a lot of monez for the company , but only the first time , because the costumers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they wo nt come back to the company with such a bad quality .so if the company wants to have success it has to improve the products , but they only do small changes and sell them the same strategy thez do the first time .in my opinion a lot of companys do it that way and that makes it very difficult to separate the good products from the bad ones .the costumers have to test the products even more clearly .has it become that worse case ?i do nt think so , because the state has to improve the laws and give more rights to the costumers .
