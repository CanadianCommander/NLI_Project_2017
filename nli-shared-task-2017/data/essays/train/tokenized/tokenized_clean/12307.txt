as cars are partly responsible for pollution and global warming , it has become a big issue that the number of cars in use is always increasing .will our governments be able to restrain the number of cars so that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use ?it seems to me that this is not going to happen soon .first of all , the world population is increasing , why would the number of cars decrease in a short-term future ?nowadays , developping countries are developping more quickly than ever before .and they will soon have the same demand for cars as developped countries , where nearly each one in the family owns a car .on top of that , car constructors are providing developping countries with cars that correspond to their standard of life , so as to be able to earn money from the market in developping countries .then , we could also think that when there is no more oil to power the cars , the number of cars will decrease .well , that may happen for a time , but those cars will quickly be replaced by cars promoted by sustainable development , and powered by clean or renewable energies , which will be as performant and as accessible to everyone as the oiled-powered cars .however , i think this increase in the number of cars wo nt last for ever .as a matter of fact , i am convinced that with the help of the governments , the number of cars will reach a kind of limit , based on a policy to restrain the number of cars and a balance between the use of cars and the use of means of mass transport .otherwise , and increasing number of cars will not fit in the cities  traffic .to sum up , i think that twenty years from today , there will be more cars , but this phenomenon is not gonna last for a long time .
