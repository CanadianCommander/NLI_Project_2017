it is debatable whether students concentrate on ther major or learn about a variety of knowledges .some people say that students have to concentrate on their majors because it is better easy to find their jobs .however , i strongly believe that students should have broad knowledge because the knoledge makes students well-rounded persons .in addition , students meet many different people who help them have more tolerant respectivities .first of all , taking various classes makes students well-rouded persons .in order to success , they also need physical health .taking physical education help student stay in shape .for example , my cousin who was suffer from obesity in order to be healthy , he took a dance class .as result of it , he could lose his weigh through the class .he could also more concentrated on studying , in the end he could get a sholarship .i think that if he just had focused on his major , he had not had these positive effects .in addtion , students can meet new people with different repectivities .it is very important for them to live the rest of their life .also , in fact , the knowledge gives them more opportunities to find job .for example , i taked a discussion class when i was a freshman in a college .then i could learn about other people s opinions about the same topic .eventually , this experience helped me to find jobs .according an article , many big corporations actually want the people who have various knowledges .that ; s because they think the various abilities help them in many aspects of business field .in conclusion , as students take various subjects , they can develop their abilities and find their talents .without any doubts , you should better experience in various fields .
