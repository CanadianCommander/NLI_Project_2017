i strongly believe that for students understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than it is for them to learn facts .unfortunately , students are often forced to study many facts and events that they will forget in a short time and wo nt be useful for their future careers .on the other side , when they understand the main concepts and the basis of a phenomenom they ll likely remember it for a long time .in my opinion the goal of an effective school system is not not fill in the minds of students with many insignificant tiny details , but to teach them how to develop their own thinking and how to deal with difficult situations .this is what i ve learned from my personal experience : when i went to secondary school , i had two different art professors ; the first one wanted us to know when and where a paint was made and the tecniques used by the painter .i was nt interested at all in this kind of information and as a result i didn  put a lot of effort in studying that subject and now , after a few years i do nt remember any of the painters that i studied with that teacher .the second teacher was completely different ; she used to put a lot of emphasis not only on the single paint ; but especially on the ideas and the feelings of the author ; she wanted us to learn not the details but the most importantn characteristic of each artistical movement .i was really fascinated by the method of teaching of the new professor and i think it was also effective because now i can still remember what i studied with her .therfore , from both my believes and my personal experience , i can say that it is more important for students to untderstand ideas rather than learn facts .
