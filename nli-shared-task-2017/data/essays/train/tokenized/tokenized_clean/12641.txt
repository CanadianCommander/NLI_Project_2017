i disagree with the statement because in my opinion this fact will not realize .because of the pollution , that exists in amount of quantity yet , the governaments will take misurs of security .the situation today is yet dangerous because the cars in use are millions and millions i the world .even if there are better situations like in holland and in other northern countries the situation is dramatic .in these countries , life is more natuaral than in other countries like italy , because abitants usually use bycicle to move .they prefer this way to the car .in italy , for example , don-t exist this attitude and this education for all or about all .but according to me for the nearby future we , humans , will arrive to the point that we will have to constrict to use public service even if we don-t want or other services will be invent to permit us to move without car .the essential problem is not the car like object but is how and what it uses to go , gasoline .with the many wars of today , this element is another enormous problem , for example .yet this is a problem .for these problems i think that governaments will do laws or other things with the idea that today will not be the future .in this way cars demand will be less than now but only if the governament will know how to fight all problems to garantee better services than today .an idea will be the sostitution of gasoline with a material less dangerous to the environment .this can cause less pollution but we need resourses for this new gasoline .the facts are difficult for us , people who live in different cities , what will be the better thing to do , especilly how will be our reaction at this changement .i don-t know , but i hope in a positive
