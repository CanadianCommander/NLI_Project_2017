the matter of young people helping in communities has been discussed for many years and still heats up our discussions .young people are often declared to be the future and therefore feel responsible for it , but for sure it s wrong to blame them for every negative tendency or development that can be found in nowadays society .i think it can not be denied any more that in former times people were much more engaged in their local sports club , church group or what kind of community ever .but why has the number of interested youth decreased here ?are we just not as nice as our former generations ?not as social turned ?of course not .the reasons must be somewhere else .today the pressure on young people is much higher .they are exspected to be successful in school , university , career etc . ..at the same time they ve become much more public by internet or modern mass communication .everybody is available everywhere , if one likes he can just go to the next town by his ( mostly ) own car and during holidays the majority can afford to fly away for holidays .50 years ago this was unimaginable .by greater mobility we gained access to many , many more things to do , places to visit and people to meet .but this does create pressure .people have the feeling of missing something when they just rest for a while .so many new have-to-do s have appeared , it s not easy for communities to attract young people to get involved in community matters any more .who wants to work as a coach at the local football club with little children ?maybe even voluntarily ?who likes to organize social afternoons for the counties older residents just to name two examples for possible community work ?these kind of community work is considered old fashioned and out of date .i do nt say i like this tendeny , i only try to explain it .of course there re still other positive examples which do not support my theses and i do know some personally .in my community some youth are involved in organizing one day trips for little children for example .but i do live in a small village in the country .how s life in big cities ?all in one i agree with the given statement , but it s too easy just too blame someone specific for this .it s not only the young people that changed , but rather our whole society .
