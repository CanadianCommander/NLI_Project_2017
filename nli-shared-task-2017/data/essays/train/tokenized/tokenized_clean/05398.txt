i agree that successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well .trying new things may involve risk but could be more beneficial from financial perspective , fame and recognition .for example , if a person is currently working for a company as a salaried employee , he or she may draw a predetermined salary for a particular period which is a guaranteed earning .but , someone trying something new may be at risk of losing the current job .however , this person is inclined and determined to start up a small parts company .he or she establishes a company with loans from banks , assistance form legal advisors , collaboration with other firms in the same or similar field .by doing this , the person gets in contact with various people , agencies and customers through which he or she learns different things at different times from time to time .also , this person now provides employment to a small group initially which may eventually become a larger firm .with the establishment in place , the person strives hard taking new risks on a continuous basis in the process of becoming a bigger firm through diferent expansions using his or her multiple contacts .to rise to this stage , the person s determination coupled with risks taken is an important factor .having not taken the risk , the person would be still working an 8 hour shift with a small paycheck with huge risk taken and conferring the growth of the firm , the person now contributes to the economy by providing employment for a larger group resulting in more tax dollars to the treasury .with the personal finacial growth and contribution to the economy , the person is recognised for his or her hard work with instant fame and recognition .supporting the statement , us has a number of exmples to state starting from sears to bill gates .all the famous personalities have proved that they took tons of risk before they were recognised for what they are today .
