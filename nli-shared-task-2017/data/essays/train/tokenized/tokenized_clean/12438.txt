i definitely hope that in 20 years there will be fewer cars being used than today .eveyday more and more people take air pollution in to consideration .people started to use local tansportation vehicles more than before .as the fuel oil prices increase the personal car use is declining .on the other hand local and or national transportation is getting more modern with the developing technology .access to many different regions is easier than before .the starting point should be environmental pollution .if we want to leave a less polluted world to our children to live , may be we can start with our cars .here is an idea ; when we are going to work why not driving one car .collegues living in the same region can get together and drive to work with one car instead of each of them driving his or her own car .this is a very common argument nowadays .hiring a minibus is an other alternative way to decrease the car amount on the roads .in today s world people are more aware and conscious about the nature .
