i think there is no miracle solutions to be successful but we can do the best to achieve this objective .i am totally agree with people who said that you must take many risks to plan a successful career .for example , if you want to open a restaurant , you must risk a part of your own money to have sufficient funds to buy all a restaurant need .if you do nt want to take this risk , you ll never open your restaurant .but only take risks will not guarantee a successful career , i think you must be innovant to achieve this objective .by doing only what you can do , you ll never progress because you do nt try to experiment a new type of work and i think successful people are in constant progress to be the most competitive in their field of activity .and if they failed in a project , they can change totally their activity because they more adaptive .so experimenting new things is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you , you will adapt to it .imagine a grocery which only sell apples .if apples disapear on the earth  surface , he has two solutions .he can stop this activity or he can sell other products .that s the reason you must adapt what you do
