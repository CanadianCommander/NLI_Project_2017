each person would have different point of views whether he or she agrees or disagrees travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but in my point of view , i do not agree with that for this statement .there are several occations that the travelling in a group led by a tour guide would have some problems .first of all , there is not enough time to spend individually for group travel .most of the tour guide during the travel need to spend time with the group according to the program that the tour guide suggest and consequently there will not have an opportunity to do whatever the the tourists want .the tourists just have follow what the tour guide has scheduled .second of all , there will not be something special during the trip .the group led by a tour guide usually made a program in which the tourist have already known and studied from the media or from the internet .of course , it could be less dangerous to travel and spend time when the tourists are led by a tour guide , but it could be bored for the tourists who already viewed from the media or the internet .consequently , there will not be something fresh and new during a group tour guide .travel in a group led by a tour guide could have different point of view in each person and of course it is true that it also have strenghness , but in my point of view , i want to spend more time with myself and want to face something special in which a tour guide have never faced before in order to have unique experience which could be unforgettable for the rest of my life and that is the main reason that i prefer to choose individual travelling rather than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
