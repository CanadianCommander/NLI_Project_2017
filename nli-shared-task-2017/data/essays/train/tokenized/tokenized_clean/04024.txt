during the last century , the number of cars in use has been growing fasterand faster everyday in the developped and rich countries .the easy access to the petroleum , its low price and the development of the economical powerful of the people are the principal reasons of this enormous expansion .today different problems make people think that there could be fewer cars in use in twenty years .the most important is the lack of petroleum .we ve been drilling petroleum for many years without considering that it s not an infinite ressource .these last years the scientists have revealed that petroleum sould be missing soon .the direct consequence is the increase of the price that we ve seen these last years .it4s clear that we need to find another source of energy to replace the petroleum the gaz seems to be the best one for the moment , but even if we can already buy some cars using gaz it seems that people are not ready for that .they keep buying some cars using petroleum .electric cars are not really popular as they re not powerfull .the other important point that could make the number of cars in use decrease in the next years is the environmental problem .this is one of the biggest problem for the different governments around the world .environment is one of the most current subjects on tv since a little bit less than ten years .it s been proved that the high numbers of cars in the big cities like london , paris or madrid is one of the reason why the pollution is so elevated .some people think that the governments could limit the number of cars that a family could buy in the economically developped countries , as they already try to limit the use of the cars in the mains cities during the summer period .what i think personnally is that , despite the development of the different public transportations ( like the tramway in paris ) , the people here are not ready for this .i think that they ll try to adapt themself to the use of new energy but wo nt buy less cars .i4ve seen a very interesting report about the recent discover of the biggest gaz reserve in the world in siberia .it was saying that this only one could give enough energy to the entire europe for the next twenty years .i really that it can work as the gaz does nt make as much pollution as the petroleum does .and i believe that during these twenty years , we ll find another type of ressource .so my opinion is that there wo nt be fewer cars in use in twenty years .much
