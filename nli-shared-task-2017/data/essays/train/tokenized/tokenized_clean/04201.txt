i don  t think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .if that was the case , consumers would always be disappointed after purchasing the products .that would erode the confidence that the consumers have in that product maker and therefore would not allow the establishment of a longterm relaltionship between the consumers and the product .advertisers would have to constantly be appealling to new consumers .whereas , what is important is the brand .adverstisers are looking into promoting the product brand as much as the product itself .once the consumers have adopted a brand , they will be more incline to buy all the products from that brand .and this is what the product makers need : more faithful consumers who are going to buy over and over products from that brand .therefore , advertisers are working on a larger scope than just trying to make look the product as good as possible .they work at creating a market , creating a need in the consumers , creating a fashion .they have much more complex messages than just : `` that product is good  .of course having attractive product is important , it contributes to the overall marketing message .if the consumer has the perception that the advertised product seem better than it is , it means that the advertisement has been poorly made and is not effective .
