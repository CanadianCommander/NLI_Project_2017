i agree that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .there are some reasons that student should learn and understand ideas and concept before the learn facts and that they need to have solid mental background as base .first , learning facts without understanding ideas and concept is same as making a sand castle .for example , if they use a machine or instument for any reason without knowing the mechanism or concept , they can copy some work but they ca nt make creative work .or when they encounter some problems , they ca nt solve anything and have to depend on other people who know the mechanism .second , they wo nt be creative .they do nt need to start from scratch for everything .however , once they know some concepts , they can manuplate and apply many things as they want and develope the current stage of work or improve to make it productive .the third reason is a making a good habit when they learn ideas and concepts .people who like to learn facts usually are lazy or superficial .once people learn facts first , they do nt want to learn ideas or concept because learning basic needs a lot of time and effort until they get the final product .they do nt want to spend their time and energy for learning invisible things .they want just product without efforts .students mean who are learning new things and developing their ability for their future or for societies they are belonged to .therefore , i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , especially when they are young .
