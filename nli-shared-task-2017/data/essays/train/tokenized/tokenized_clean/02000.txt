i believe that there would be more cars 20 years down the lane than there are today .my statement is based on below facts .as of now only 7 % of the world population is using cars .mostly this population resides in developed countries .the ratio of people using cars in developing and under developed countries is very low , due to poverty or shortage of disposable income to be spent on luxury .the statistics show an upward trend in income of people living in developing and under developed countriesfor example , number of cars on road in developing countries like india and china have seen a 30 % growth annually over the last decade .other countries are joining this race .further the government of such countries are also providing infrastructure in terms of roads .hence , using a car becomes easier .in addition , the world is moving towards globalisation .with this , availaibilty of cars for sale and availaiblity of wider range of cars like cost effective cars is being witnessed .hence , people would be able to buy and mainatin a car more conviently , than today .for example , in last 2 decades there has been a 300 % increase in number of people directly or indirectly involved with automotive industry .this is only possible if the automotive industry is showing very positive growth signs .moreover , the change in outlook of people .cars which were once considered a luxury are now being viewed as neccessasity to remain mobile .one more very underlying but important reason for people not to buy cars is its running cost i.e. cost of fuel the car runs on .with invention of cars which run of water , solar energy or japharta ( a seed which can produce pertol ) and other such biodegrable sources , using a car would gradually become cheaper and envioremental friendly , encouraging more people to buy & use car .further rate of car being disposed of as non usable is very low , as technology is available to refunction and reuse them .all the development mentioned above is taking place gradually and it will see its peak after to 18-20 years .hence , my claim .
