in the past , knowledge was not valued and spread as it is nowadays .the people counted on their working capacities to ensure their food and necessities .in our time , it is becoming , more and more , a necessity to be well educated , otherwise your opportunities to get a respectful job are very limited .manytimes , we appreciate those specialized people who can cover all the surounding criteria in a certain subject more then the people who have diversified their knowledge .both broad knowledge and specific subject knowledge are in need in our society and each one is characterized by a different set of benefits .specialization in one specific subject is a must in the research centers , in the universities and in the research development departments of the big companies .those persons are characterized by a very different and accurate knowledge in some fields which can lead to minimize errors and could lead to some creativity of new products or research methodologies .generally speaking , those people can find jobs much easily in the developped countries like the u.s , canada , france . ..for example , if i will be able to get a phd , most probably i will not return back to my native country since the opportunity to work for such qualified persons are very limited .so before deciding if i will apply to this i should accept the next decision , which is to continue my life abroad .although specialization seems to be very good , many job opportunities in the developping and under developped countries can not hire such persons .for them , such persons are considered as overqualified employees and they do not need their additional knowledge that they have gathered through their specialization .they are mostly seeking in persons who can do many jobs in the same time .so at this level , a person who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would most probably welcomed since he will be able to work on different and this exactly will satisfy the needs of the managers .i give the example when i was working for the first time after i have my undergraduate studies as agricultural enginner : the manager accepted me , but not a master degree student because he is not ready to pay a little bit more for his knowledge ; he did nt need his qualifications .later i figured out that the manager hired me not just because i am an agricultural engineer but because i have great computer skills and because i have got some extra courses in marketing .so my diversified knowledge permitted to me to get the job , while the other person , who has a master degree in agriculture was not accepted .as a conclusion , both of the two concepts is valued ; we have always to weigh the benefits of each , clarify our needs and goals , and then to choose between specializing in one specific subject or trying to get a much broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
