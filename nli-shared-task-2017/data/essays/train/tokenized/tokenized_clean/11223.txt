do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?it is a great question to be offered because nowadays young generation ignore how to helping and contributing their communites more than the past .i totally agree that instead of giving enough time to helping the society , they concentrate themselves more .first of all , because of the education from the family and the society , they teach the young generation that they should think themselves first then the other things , even the things are about the country and the world .the education tells them that no matter what happend , they should develope themselves first .according to this kind of theory , nowadays the young generation becomes more selfish then the past one .due to this situation , i think that while we discuss that if the young people should pay more attention in their communities , the education of family and society should be discussed at the same time .secondly , nowadays no matter which country you belong , it is kind of tendency that there are fewer children in a family , for instance , mainland china , only one child in a family is normal .depending on this situation , the child does not know how to get along with the other people , how to care the peer and how to contribute himself for the society .surely , he will not focus on the need of the community and the world .the first task he thinks is how to develope himself well .besides , nowadays parents always give too much pressure on young people s grade , and i think that s also the reason why the young generation ignore the communities and society .to the summarize , it is kind of worse tendency that young generation does not pay attention to their communities .in my opinion , if we hope to develope more wonderful society and world which we belongs , the first task we have to do is teaching the young generation does not be selfish any more , on the contrary , they should focus on the society and world more .
