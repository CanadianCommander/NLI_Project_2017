throughtout high school , students learn several different academic subject , ones which some do like or dislike .for a fact , it could be said that most students do not like all the academic classes they must take in high school .however , after graduating for high school , there is a wide opportunity for students to enter a more specific area of study , where they will be able to choose to do something the really like , and not because it is a requirement .both parts of learning , whether it is broad or specific , are both part of the process or learning .nevertheless , if i were to comment on whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subjet i d say that being specialized in one specific subject is better because you know what you want and like to know , you can do what you want to do , and help others in what you know the best .being specialized in a specific subject does not come without having the broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but indeed , it is what leads a person into doing what they really want to do .as personal experience , in high school , many students hate either one or more subjects that they rather not take probably because they do nt understand , or just dont like doing it .however , you do get a sense of what every academic subject involves , and you can get an idea of what you like and what not .knowing that , for example , you like math , you will go to college , to study something involving math , which besides being the area you like , will encourage you to work even seriously because now , it is the only thing you must work for .after going to college , you are already very practiced in the area you like and chose to study for the rest of your life .parting from there , knowing your area , you can find jods in several different things that involves you area , and for the rest fo your life , do something that you will enjoy doing .not like in school , where you did nt enjoy passing some class , and you had bad grades in it , it would be like having good grades in a class that you like and understood .a person would just feel better doing something they truly love .once , you know do what you like to do , comes the important part of specilizing in one specific subjet , the one of helping others in what you know best .specifically knowing , for example , about children diseases , you could help so many people , who die endlessly because they do not have neither resources or anyone to help them .having a borad knowledge would also allow you to help , but not as profoundly as you could knowing specifically one subject .eventhough i believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , i believe that we could nt specify in a subject we love without having the knowledge of many subjects .if we would nt know what biology is , how can we dislike it , or how can we know if that is what we like .like i said in the beggining , both are a part of learning , its just that one choice , perhaps could be described as going further into achieving higher goals .
