if young people enjoy life more than the old people do ?there may be many defferent answers according to defferrent people s indentity exprences .in my opinion , i do nt think that young poeple enjoy their lives more than old ones , because of several reasons following :first of all , young people have less time to enjoy their lives compraring to the old people .people spend their early life on studing , working and many other things that can promise a goog future .old people in the other hand , almost retire from the busness that calling hard-woks , so they have a plenty of time to enjoy the live .secondly , young poeple , sometimes , dontt really undterstand what is the best of live , so they always spend their time on something they do nt really like .when they think they are enjoying the live , actually , they dontt really feel happiness .for example , many young people believe that big city can make their dreams becaming true .they going to there to look for good job .but always they ca nt get the job they want , because there are so many young poeple there and the competing is very sharply .but the old men who have a lot of live exprences may be more clare whith what they want really and spend their time to get it , to enjoy it .finnally , old people have less pressures than yuong people .their yuong children have grown up , their career has completed , their life push has slowdown , so they have a release haert to enjoy the life .yuong poeple , on the contrast , have varis of pressures , such as childen , career and even the old parents .they have many tast to do .they do nt releasing heart to enjoy the life .in a short word , the old people may enjoy their live more than yuong people do .it is fair , because they have spend for their enjoyment during their erlier lives .
