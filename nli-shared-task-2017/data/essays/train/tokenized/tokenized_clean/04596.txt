throughout history , humans have competed and strived to find and derive the best way possible to advertise and sell a product .this key concept is illustrated precisely by this statement ; for which , i would definately agree with the statement for three main reasons .the core of this statement is rooted in essential marketing techinques that are vital for the sale and profit of any product .the first main proof for this statement is seen in the essential concept that everyone that produces something to sell will want consumers to be attracted to the product by any means possible .it is in human nature to allways want the best quality possible for what one is buying .thus , an advertisement that makes the product appear much better than they really are is a key technique in pulling a costumer to buy the product .this is because the costumer expects the product the be at its best quality .once the consumer has decided to buy the product that attracts him ( due to the fine quality in the advertisement ) , he will go and buy it .however , if a product creates a great demand due to is advertising it will cause an increase in the amount supplied , because more people will want it .this brings the second proof for the statment .in order to have a greater amount of the product produced , the company producing the item will have to forgo time and effectiveness in makeing a finer quality product , in order to make more , which are worst than what appear in the advertisement .the third main point is that an attractive advertisement will draw people to buy that product over other similar competing products .this will make businesses and companies make their product appear better than it really is in orther to get consumers to buy theirs over their competition s .ultimately , as the world shifts into a greater consumer society , humans are going to want to see that their money spent ( investment in a product ) has a great appearnce .there are many products in the market that even though they are not the best quality appear to be the best thorugh their popularity and heavy advertisments .a real example could be seen with the recent popularity of the mp3 players ipod .even thorugh their technology , capacity , and applications is worse than others ( such as sony s creative mp3 players ) , their attractive advertisement and global popularity have created a huge demand , even through they are not the best product for the amount of money spent on the market .therefore , through these three principles and the examples provided it is reasonalbe to see how most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
