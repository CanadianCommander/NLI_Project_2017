i prefer having a broad knowledge of different academic subjects that specilizing in one specific subject .specializing in an specific field is not a weird decition , we can see in our daily lifes that there is a lot of people that in the last year of degree decide to continue studying in an specific field of knowledge .however , under my own point of view and experience i prefer having a large knowlenge in different subjets , because this is translated into a person who is able to face with different topics in a discussion or debate .first of all , i would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future i will like to work in a bussiness in which to do a dynamic work .i mean , consultants , for instance , change the projects in which they are working every week , so they have to deal with different subjects , such as telecommunications , energy resources , economy . ..that is what i like !!!however , as i said before , many people decide to specialize in a field .this is the case of proffessors at university .for example , in the faculty of chemistry we can find different departments : organic chemistry , inorganic chemistry , thermodinamics . ..proffessors have to specialize in a subject because they are dealing every day with the same aspects , and they need to know as much as possible about a certain field .the best of all would be to have a large knowledge of lots of subjects , but this is not possible today for human being , because our brain can not retain so much information .even though , i have heard of people that have studied like 5 or 6 degrees .i think this is fantastic !!!this people are very lucky of being so intelligent .all in all , i think that in the world should be both kind of people : those who specialize and those who have a broad knowledge of different subjects , because both of them are neccessary in different situactions .
