i dont agree with `` jack of all traits and master of none  i personally feel its better to expertise in a single feild rather than trying to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects since , it will lead us no where .firstly , it would be a difficult task for the students to throw light on every subject they learn as a part of their academic curriculum .instead of this , students can concentarte on a single subject and try to learn more of it .this will help the student to learn a subject with more interest and also gives a chance for the student to choose the subject they wish to expertise .but in the case if the student tries to have a broad knowledge of all subjects one day he will be confused about himself .therefore , its more advisable to master in a particular area of the students interest .to have a clear illustration of this let us consider a real time example .if we consider two students , among which one has a broad knowledge in all the academics and the other is a specialist in hardware engineering .if these two apply for a particular job say , for the post of a hardware engineer than the former student will have a few chances for accquiring the job since he has no profound knowledge in that particular area but , he just has an overview of it .and therefore the other student will be consider for the job .not only in the case of employement but also in real life , the one who has deep knowledge of his specific subject could survive any where in this competitive market .and by expertising more in a single feild he will get a very good insight about his subject and he will be capable of fetching good rewards and fame in his area of study .therefore it is always advisable to master in a particular feild .
