with reference to these different solution , i think that both the possibilities have got advantages and disadvantages .in my opinion , if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specific subject depends on several factors such as the country where do you have to work and which kind of job you are interested to .indeed each country has got its own traditions and political system that surely influence the academic choice of a person .in my country , it is more common to have a broad knowledge of many subjects so people could have a wider choice between many jobs .it is also very important which job you would like to do in the future .indeed scientifical jobs need specialized knowledge of a subject such as chemistry or math .on the other hand there are several jobs which need a broad knowledge of many subjects .for example a person who wants to teach licterature have to study grammar , poetry , history , and so on .although specialize in one specific subject has got its positive factors , such as the possibility to find early a good job , i surely prefer to have a broad knowledge for several reasons .first of all , i would like to know a lot about our world , and if i studied a specific subject i would know only a topic .secondly by having broad knowledge you will be able to choose between different jobs .after all you can specialize yourself after that you have found a good job .so i generally do agree with the statement
