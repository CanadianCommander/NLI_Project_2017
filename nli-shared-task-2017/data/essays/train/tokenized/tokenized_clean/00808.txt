i always belive that every age has its own beauty .when i look around and observe people from different ages all around me , i can see that they love to do different things and they enjoy different things but they can still enjoy .i do not think that the people who are in their old ages enjoy the life less that the young ones .a young person may do lots of things in a single day than an older one .he can go to cinema in the afternoon , go to shoopping in the evening and go to a concert with their friends at night .however , it does not mean that not doing these kind of activities makes the older one enjoy the life less the younger one .the older one may have done all these before in his younger ages and may want to do diffrent things such as having a beatiful dinner with his children and grandchildren or may want to have a walk with one of his friend to have a cup of tea on the seaside .people at some certain ages are already have the taste of something and they want to do diffrent things .i do not belive that , this makes them enjoy life less than the young people .my mother loves to cook delicious meals when i go to my hometown at the holidays , and my father says that the happiest times of my mother are those when i say that ` mum , these are all delicious` .my mother enjoys the life at those time .i can see it in her eyes .going to cinema or shopping or to a concert do not make happy her as much as having a dinner with all familiy .overall , people can be happy with diffrent things in their different ages .therefore , they can enjoy life very much at their older ages .
