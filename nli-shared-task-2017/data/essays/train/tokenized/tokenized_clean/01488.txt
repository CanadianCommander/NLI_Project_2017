i would probably disagree with the statement because its more like an opinion stated considering a specific area of interest or pertaining to a particular place in the world .i say this because cars have , of late , started being affordable to the common man .they are no longer the prized posssession of the high-class and the elite` .cars have become the common mode of conveyance in the recent past and this situation is likely to persist for atleast a while , why not for 20 years .cars are nowadays seen to accommodate all kinds of people and have emerged as the economical and faster means of conveyance anywhere in the world .the idea that there will be fewer cars in the years to come is entirely provincial in my view .we should not forget the fact that a larger share of the population in any nation still commute by auto-rickshaws , buses and trains even today .people who are primarily concerned with their financial status prefer travelling by buses to having a car .majority of the middle and most of the lower classes do not even consider the option of owning a car .for instance , a person who plans to spend $ 100 for his monthly conveyance can not opt for a car which incurs an expenditure of 250 $ as it consumes the lion s share of his earnings .thanks to the ever-rising petroleum and crude oil prices , the option of owning a motor vehicle has gone further down the list of luxuries to be possessed .but , the wide range of comfort a car offers has been something to think about in the present day situation where time is of essence and the need for speed in life is pronounced .cars are the emerging mode of transportation in the present world scenario in a broader sense .they are no longer a luxury , rather a necessity now .i would personally like to justify my opinion by saying that any statement made can be acceptable if and only if its applicable to the majority of the population .ofcourse , in the united states , travelling by air has proved to be cheaper than that of by air and thus can lead to speculations that ground travel would be less preferred in the future .pollution has also been cited as a reason in the case of cars .but in view of the larger picture of the globe , it can be said that cars would continue to be the most common mode of transport and commutation in the near future .
