i disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is confusing and wasting time .when you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you wo nt be able to focus on specific subject .so , you probaply wo nt be able to determine which subject you should choose .in addition to that , you will be wasting your time to know about diffrent subjects you batter save this time for your subject that you like for example , if i am interested in art i should look for subjects that are related to art .that will make me more interested in art and also having more knowledge about art .however , if i am interested in many subjects i will spend alot of time to know about many subjects that i am nt really interested in .in short , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is confusing and wasting time .
