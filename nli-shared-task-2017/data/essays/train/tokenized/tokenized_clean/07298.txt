certainly , these days it is said young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .in fact , it might be dicreasing time that young people help their communities little by little .but they still give enough time to helping thier communities .i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .the primary reason is that a lot of young people work for communities .parhaps the best example to illustrate this point is that where i live , in japan , there are farmers .some elder people do not have the person who succeed in them .so it must be difficult for them to keep on working .but young people like students of university or community college helps farmers a lot .second , young people help the elder people in their houses .there are a lot of elder people who can not do things by him or herself in japan .the example of this is that many young people helps elder peoples in their houses and also in the rouzin home , which is the home take caring for elder people .young people helps them to go to the rest room or to clearn them up with hot water or to make them eat easily .considering the above factors , i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
