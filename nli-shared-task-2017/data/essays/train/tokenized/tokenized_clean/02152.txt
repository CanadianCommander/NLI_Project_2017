i do nt agree that poeple saying to unbderstand the concepts and ideas is important that they learn form the facts .idea and concept are the major factors of learning , but not the overall .the reason i saying that is idea and concept are just a text or a sentenes .they were not alive .the main point of learning is learing how to live .there is a millian fo situation will happen in our life which the concept ca nt tell .let say a subject we widly studying - econ .there is a lot of concept in the economic text book , is nt it ?altough the student can memorize it , but could they recognize it ?i do nt think so , beause i have been this situation before .student can always memorize the concept when they are studying teh course .they could do really well in teh exam .however , could they answer you again at the next semestor ?maybe they would , but it would not happen at three semestor after .learning is about our whole life , but not for a moment only .we learn someting when we are young , then it would be a weapon for us to fight the hard time we have in the future .how about learning the facts or learning in the real life ?imagine how do you learn to walk ?i think is walking , right ?however , what is the reason we could memorize to walk for the whole life ?because we did walking every singlt day .well , let say an example to make more sense .compare with two man who are on the same age .one man have work about business for five years .the other one is just start his business but he did finish teh whole university business course .well , who do you think is the man could handle a hard-time ?the first man , for sure .becasue he got experience and the `` real  ability .people wil say a good knowledge migh help a lot .yes , they are right .nevertheless , learning fact equal learning the way we use the concept and idea .that is the formula to be a succesful man .
