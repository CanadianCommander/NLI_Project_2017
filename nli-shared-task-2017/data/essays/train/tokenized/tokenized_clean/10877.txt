the question at hand is that `` will there be fewer cars in use after twenty years than there today  .the automobile technology has been climbing acclivities of advancements over the past few years .but at the same time the challenge introduced due to the fast depleting petroleum resources has impeded high hopes of the industry .but still i would say that the industry would continue to flourish irrespective of the fore mentioned challenge due to several reasons .the most pressing reason would be the earnest researches in the field of new and renewable sources of energy to substitute of petroleum .a few companies have already come up with electrical cars while the researchs on the hydrogen cells are speeding up .these energy sources not only answers the challenges of depleting petroleum resources but also picturises an ecofriendly future generation cars .this is because the expected emission from electrical or hydrogen cell based cars are much lower than the cars of today .although the initial price range of the new generation cars are rated above the cars of today , the running cost is expected to be considerably less .for example in the case of an electrical car the running cost is all about chargin the cell which would be much cheaper compared to the oil prices twenty years later .so in the long run the next generation cars would be cheaper than the pesent day cars .another important factor is that pocessing a car has become an important part of ones social dignity .the purpose of buying a car has grown much beyond the sole purpose of transportation .the hype on the formula1 racing and automobile exibitions has has influenced people in all strata of the society .despite the rise in oil prices the number of car buyers has never looked down .the media has been quite successful in transforming the once adomant car market into an inelastic senario .when all the automobile industries have charged up their research sectors and with the existing media hype it is impossible to belive that the auto industry will collapse .
