i believe we live in a whole world .i mean even if physically and intellectually people are different , we live together and we have to feel good about that .to feel comfortable we have to understand each other , that is why i think a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .first i plan to work in the hotel industry and why not a day running my own hotel .in order to achieve this goal i need to be polyvalent and know about many different areas .i have followed business studies which lead me to learn things about many different topics such as management , finance , strategy , languages . ..i found very interesting to learn about different materials coming from different part of the world .then i believe that acquiring knowledge of several academics enables people to be more open minded and autonomous when they face problems perhaps not in their work but in their daily life .i think the main goal of standard education all over the world is to teach people a base of vital knowledge which involves different topics : reading , counting , speaking , writing .to finish i am sure that many people need to specialize in order to achieve their goal , but this is not my view of life .i agree that some professional need to be highly specialized in their domain like surgeons , traders . ..but it does not prevent those specialists to have interest in other topics .that is why i believe that a broad knowledge of subjects is more valuable than to be specialized .
