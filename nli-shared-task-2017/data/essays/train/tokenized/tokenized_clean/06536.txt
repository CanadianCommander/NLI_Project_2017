how can you judge or measure , if someones enjoying his life or is happy .i think you ca nt generalise that young people enjoy their life more than old people .you als ca nt say wether rich or poor people are more happier .the first thought is maybe that young people like children or teenagers could be enjoying their lives more than older people do , because they do nt have to care about such a lot things like their parents , like paying the bills , shop some food , going to work etc .it appears that young people have more free time , what gives them the ability to do many thing they like an enjoy .but in every part of your life there are certain typically things you worry about .for example a teenager has to grow up , find out what type of human he is , what he likes or dislikes , make experiences with the other gender .that can bring joy and pain .the most people look at their childhood and believe it was a very good time , but the most do nt want to make certain experiences again .although in your later life you normally got more work to do and more things to worry about you could enjoy this special part of your life .one other thing why older people could enyjoy their life less , is maybe that they do nt have family and are alone .sure on the one hand it happens to old people that their friends die and they have no family , but on the other hand there are so much examples of old people , who are stille married and still have a lot of friends and famlily .in my opinion happyness and joy can not be categorised by such things like age , gender or the money you have .your life and every part of it can bring you joy .everyone is responsible for his own joy , no matter how old he is .therefore i disagree with the statement .
