when we predict about the future , we can see fewer cars in use than there are today .nowadays , we use cars the most of time .when we go to school , go office , or go store , we take our cars with us ; but the car is not the best way for transportation actually .there are many problems come up when we take cars .first of all , there are limited sourses to make cars move .as we can see on the newspapers , gasoline is running out .we can make soloer power to make a car moves , but we can not ride a car when we do not have sunlight , such as winter season .or maybe we can find biotic sources , but it will also run out someday .although gasoline is the best source for cars , it no longer avellable .everytime when we take cars , we make carbon dioxine goes around our city .in the situation we get terrible traffic jam , we might stay in the same place for a few hours .this causes grobal warming .if we continue acting like this , the climate would go up and up , and we are going to die bacause of that someday .in the future , there are high possibility that we are going to use the better transportations .when we use cars , we have to drive , worry about traffic , or worry about the expensive cost of gasoline .actually taking a car is not fast way to transport .there are much faster transportations , such as , train or airplane .nowadays , the goverment start making the train-station all around the city .in additon , the cost of taking air plane becomes chaper because they are no more new technology .these transportations are more convenience than cars .in our everydaylives , we use cars for transportation for the most of time .however , in the furute , this will change .the car is no more convenience tranportation to use .we are going to use better transportaions to reduce our time for moving and stop polluting the environment .
