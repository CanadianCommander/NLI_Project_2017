young people think that they can enjoy their life more than the older ones , but in my opinion i think older people can enjoy their life even more if they want to .sometimes you see a 100 old man or a women that can talks like a 20 years old man .this is related to the feelings and to the minds .for example , if a 20 years old man always nagging about his life and always complaining about life and problems and never stops a moment to think and ask himself : is life really worth it ??am i really sick or thats just in my mind ?he will always feel sick if thats what was in his mind .accepting your life as it is is a treature and most people these days do nt have it !there is a question that how can the older men enjoy their lives ?to answer this question we should ask ourselfs first what are the pleasures in life ??i mean it depends on each person .some people think of parties and calaberating all day long .others find pleasures in their food .what can he eat on the next meal ?traveling is a pleasure for some people .they travel all around the world to discover more places and meet new people .others just find their pleasures sitting home watching tv all day .so , back to our question : what can be the pleasure of an old man ?you ca nt say really it depends on his personality , but maybe in my opinion he just love to sit home with his family doing many stuff that we see it as silly stuff but its really maters for him , like drinking tea with his son and discussing some things .finally , you can be young in your heart no matter what your age is .
