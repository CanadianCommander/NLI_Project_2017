in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .what will happen with the development of cars ?will the amount of driving cars in 2030 increase or decrease ?let s take a short look on the fast development of cars .they were invented in about the 1920s and became more and more popular for all people all over the world within the last century .nowadays , it is unbelieveable not to have car or a possibility to lend one , if you need one .people got used to their drivable possibility to get from point a to point b whenever they want to and how often they want to .they do nt depend on any busses , trains or even flights .even think of the high taxes and fees one has to pay if he uses any public traffics .beside the fact , a car is one s chance to get form a to b , a car enables you to feel free and independent .if you want to go on vacation , get your car ready and leave your homecountry .but this , unfortunately , is luxuary , especially in times like this when oil-price is as high as it has never been before .one has to effort his or her car .having a car , turns out to be a question of money and the possibility to effort it .it ll be senseless , to spend all your loan on gas , would nt it ? !furthermore , the amount of gas that pollutions the air everyday , every minute , exactly every second , is still rising and does nt seem to get less in future .although there are several techniqual developments and inventions , it ll be a problem and influences the environment a lot .what will be in about 20 years ?will people think about this facts and problems and turn into another development of enviromental and social thinking ?will there be a chance to be fewer cars used than they are today ?in my opinion , i do nt believe in this solution , being fewer cars in 2030 than they are now .people more and more get selfish , always want the best and newest version of an invention ( car ) and they probably will change a certain way of group , social and enviromental thinking but they wo nt change their behavior towards car-using .in my opinion , there are only two things that will lead a change in the amount of cars used .first the changing of laws by the government enforcing people to fullfill certain policies in car using ( such as car sharing , car-free days , etc . )and second if the oil price is still increasing !
