although some people prefer to say that the advertisements show what you got , i prefer to say that this might not be the case .in my opinion , the people that make those advertisements not only have a gap in the knowledge of about the characteristics of the product , but also they have a good knowledge about how to use secret messages that makes the product essay to sell .in the following essay , i will defend my opinion with pertinet reasons and illustrative examples .most of the people that meke advertisments for whatever product is on sell , they realy do nt know the characteristics about the product .if some company is seeling shampoos for example , they are not going to tell you the specifics about that shampoo .even more , they wo nt show those characteristics that makes the product cheap on the at .they prefer to show us only the good things about that product .i believe , that this happen because the companies want to make money as soon as they can , and they do nt pay attention on waht is realy important for costumers .they realy know how to sell the product , not because they studyied the product , like the shampoo i just said above , they realy know how to sell the product because they sometimes use secret messages on their advertisements .for example , they show up on their advertisements nude women , they use sex to sell , and as a result of that they sell more and more shampoos , because everybody wants to look like that woman or that man .in the essay above , i have defended my choice with pertinent reasons and examples .as you can see , i rather buy my staff not paying attention at the advertisements , and i strongly recomend to get more knowledge about the staff that you are just going to buy .
