learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts .in my opinion i disagree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important first reason is that experincing ideas and lessons is more effective way to try them in our daily lives .we learn many things in school and from friends but when to do and get benefit from them .second reason is that understanding ideas is more likely to lose than learning facts .we someone learns a fact , it stays in his or her mine because it is a fact .third reason is that learning facts is more interesting understand concepts .
