scientist often make predictions about future changes in society , especially when it comes to technical innovations .indeed , it is imaginable that in future years , people use fewer cars than nowadays .however , i would not fully agree with the statement .on the one hand , it is true that the public transportion system gets better .especially in highly populated areas such as huge cities , the public transport becomes better integrated into the town s scape , just think of berlin , hamburg , london or paris .there , it is more comfortable and much faster to take the bus or the underground .another development speaking for fewer cars are sinking travel costs .over the last years , it became much cheaper to travel by train or plane .companies like ryanair or vogtlandexpress , a competiting train brand , offer very good travel , even within germany .so that it could be a logical consequence that car transport will be used fewer .on the other hand , do both theories work for areas of high population .if i think my home town , the public transport system is nearly underdeveloped compared to berlin .since the main part of germany or other industrialised countries does not live in the huge cities , people will need cars to get from their home to the working place .i think , that i will not change within the next twenty years , so that in average of the whole country , the car use will not decrease much .
