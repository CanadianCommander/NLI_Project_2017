successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .i do agree with the given statement absolutely .it is the inclination for taking up things that are different from the conventional ways and means of doing things , that set the successful people apart from their plebian fellow beings .for e.g. had it not been for the wright brothers , we would not have known the face of the aeroplane today .it is their determination to do something different that made it possible .they dared to take the plane into the air . ..up and up . ..and their reputation soared even higher .successful people tend to take the less trodden path and achieve success at the end of it .it speaks of their determination and perseverance .take for instance , thomas alva edison . .the inventor of electric bulb .he failed many a times before he could succeed .the failures didnt deter him , instead they motivated him to try still harder .complacence is not a virtue of successful people .they try to improve on the things further .if the invention has stopped with the bicycle , imagine how would the world have been today .if people are content with what they have , then their is no progress in life .some people , people with vision and passion , take upon them the task of doing new things and take risks instead of going along with the routine , and they are the people who stand apart from the commons and become exemplary .
