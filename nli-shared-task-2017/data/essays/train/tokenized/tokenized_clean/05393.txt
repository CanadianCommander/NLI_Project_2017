is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?i think not .first , because facts are things that can really be change .facts are the way they are and there is nothing we can do about then to change then or to modify the things they try to let us know .in the other hand , ideas , as the name give us a clue , are the things we think or believe about something .as an example , we all know that we need air to live .if there were no air , we all would die .but instead of only teaching this we get the ideas of why air is necessary .we breath it , it goes to our lungs then the oxigen is transported to the whole body traveling by the blood .we can get to know that it is important .following the same example , we can find the concept of `` breathing  then we get all the idea we mentioned above .with that information we can reach a fact : air is needed to live .another reason why ideas and concepts are better than only facts .with the first i mentioned we can find out more information than with facts .thanks to the concepts , we can understand the way things are , the way why the sky is blue , why our blood is red , how is it that the light is reflected , etc . .facts let us know things someone else , thanks to investigation , concepts and ideas discovered .someone may say `` what s so wrong about it ?if we are not motivated to investigate , to satisfy our necessity of knowing , we will only take the `` free samples  we recieve from facts .besides , if we cook our ideas , and bake our spicy concepts then we can find a complete menu of knowlage .free to whoever who wants to try it .and once you try it , you are going to look for it .it is better to cook thant just to but a pack of cookies .to make my point clear , with facts we do nt reall y get to investigate or to make a research about things .but with ideas and concepts we can create our facts , thanks to the information we looked for .and that is why i disagree with the statement on the first line .
