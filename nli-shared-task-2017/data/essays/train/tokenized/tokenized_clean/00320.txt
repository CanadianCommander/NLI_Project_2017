in the last years , car has became an useful means of transportation , for example in order to travel or to go at work .moreover , car has improved life s people .i and my family have only one car but this means come used several times .for example , i use car in order to go outdoor with my friends or in order to go at supermarket for shopping .in regard of statement that affirm that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , i partially agree .i think that car , even today , is one of the most means of transportation used and i think that this means will be even in the future , even if much people prefer use alternative means , like for example train or airplane in order to speed the travel .but , in the future , can happen that , if the price of petroleum increase very much , people will not use car in order to not spend much money .in conclusion , there are two different points of view in regard to the use of car .there are people that affirm that in the future there will be not more cars respect to today ; instead , there are other people that think that cars will continue to be used even in the future .as i saw earlier , i agree with the last point of view , but i think also that use of car will depend by what will be happen in the future in regard to economic elements , in particular the price of petrolium .
