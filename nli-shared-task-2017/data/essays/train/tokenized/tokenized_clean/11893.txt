i believe that both my grand mother and i enjoy our own life and fell happy through such daily days .in my situation , i think that my way to enjoy is quite defferent with my grand mather .therfore i mean that there is a big defference point to enjoy of life between young people and older people .however personally , i agree with this atatement .firstly , when we go outside , especially downtown , there are more things which young people enjoy with , such as amusement parks and shops that of older people .therefore they can enjoy their free time more easily older prople can .secondly , because generelly young people are active and out going .therefore they have more oppotunity to meet a lot of people .through these meetings , someone can have make a good friends , the other can find soul mate in rest of your life .i think these oppotunities make our life more fun and exciting .thirdly , many young people have specific dream in their furture , such as what they want be or what they want to in the future , and they must work hard for it .thats completely great thing .for example , a friends of mune are now studing so hard to be japanese teacher .although , of course , she sometimes feel negative or stressfull for her hardships she always sparkling .i xan feel that she is enjoying her life very much and satisfied .in conclusion , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of these reasons .however , i think that the older people should enjoy their life as muchas they can , and many of them do already .i hope that we can enjoy whole of our life regardress our age .
