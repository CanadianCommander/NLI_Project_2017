i naturally have to agree with statement .nowadays , one can easily see that a lot of elements are forcing us to put our car in the garage and not to use it .we will try to analyze in the following parts all these reasons which can make us think that in the future , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .on the one hand , it is really simple to see that today , a car seems to be the best way to go from a place to an other one .but we must ask ourselves if it will stay like that forever .prices of planes companies are cheaper day after day and prices of cars  insurance are still expensive .moreover , since the war in irak , i do not think that the price of oil will fall soon .one has to think clearly about the reasons which will make him use his car as it will cost him a lot .and as people are more and more conscious about it , we can hope that government will help to support people to take the bus to go to work .on the other hand , there is one point that we certainly do not have to miss : the pollution .how can we accept to use something which will kill our planet and our children in the future ?it is totally unbelievable .it costs a lot of money , it is not good for us and the planet and finally that is definetly not the fastest way to go somewhere you can not go by walk .i trully think that in the future , people will choose other ways to go at work and more than that , will not buy cars anymore .come hell or high water , we can not accept to live as we are today , it is an egoist state of mind .if we really need cars , we should keep it for the rainy days and not use it everytime we have to do something .to put it in a nut-shell , i personnaly think that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as it costs a lot and it will kill ourselves if we continue .people will understand that the planet is more important than going somewhere quickly , and if it is just a matter of speed , they will take the plane or the train .
