regarding the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that indicates that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  , i would have to disagree .the main reason : why pick one side of the balance , when - at least in this case - you can choose both ?i think that the specific knowledge of a subject does not excuse a person of knowing other subjects , even if it is at a small level .knowledge always complements our activities and , most importantly , it complements ourselves .knowledge makes us more complete individuals and better professionals , no matter what activity , profession or craft we practice .imagine if the statement was true . ..if we could only pick one side of the balance it could be inferrered that an aeronautical engineer would not be able to sustain a conversation with the louvre museum curator , for example .do you imagine what they both would be missing ?regarding the second part of the statement reffering to `` broad knowledge of many academic subjects  i disagree based on personal experience .i m a journalist , and in my country there s a saying that states that journalists have `` an ocean of knowledge . ..only one inch deep  .this highly offends me , because it generalizes the idea that a journalist is not able to conduct and actual investigation on a subject ( because of his lack of knowledge depth ) .on the other hand , i ve seen journalists use this `` statement  as an excuse for their lack of knowledge and investigative capacities , which offends me even more !why not have specific subject knowledge combined with broad knowledge of other subjects ?for me , this is the perfect choice : it allows me to become a more complete professional and person , and to talk and exchange ideas with a variety of people and professionals , which derives into constant learning of new things .this would also make the world a much `` social  place : everybody could satisfactory discuss topics and exchange ideas with lots of different people .the world would nt be made of `` knowledge ghettos  ( engineers vs .artists , musicians vs .chemists ) .could you imagine the isolation ?so let s get all the knowledge we can , both broadly and specifically .when it comes to knowledge , do not choose a side , learn about them all !
