thinking about this statement i come to the conclusion that this statement is actually nonsense and impossible evaluate .the first problem of this staement is that it is much too broad .in order to be able to evaluate on the topic one first has to narrow down the age groups in question .what is meant by `` younger people  ?what is meant by `` older people  ?if `` younger people  means children of , for example , 3-5 years of age and `` older people  means their parents then i fully agree with the statement .if one has ever observed children in kindergarten they seem to have no worries .they can play and meet their friends and ususally everthing is taken care of for them by the parents .the parents , on the other hand , as already implied , have to take care of everything : they have to work in order to be able to buy everything necessary for every-day life , such as food and clothing .the situation changes when the children get to school .they have duties to fulfill such as attending the classes and doing thier homework .this all virtually eats thier time they used to spend for so many other nice things .any adult would say now : `` oh , if i could just go back to school again !however , it is not about the adults here but about the children s perception .in the eyes of children school can be very anoying which leads to them not enjoying their life as much as they used to .to which degree they do not enjoy it can not be answered here .it can not be answered , either , whether they enjoy it more or less than adults .this is dependent on many more factors , probably most importantly personal perception .it is in everyone s own view whether one enjoy s life or not .measuring and comparing joy is rather impossible .thus , generalizations should be avoided , also because each age group has own worries as well as each society .children as well as their parents in europe have to worry about different things than children in africa , for example .a proof for which age group in which society is the happiest one is probably impossible to produce - if it was , the result would probably be rather astonishing .
