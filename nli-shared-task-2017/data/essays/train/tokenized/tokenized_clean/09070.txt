let us begin by defining `` suceess  and `` successful people  .success by far is something that has different meanings for different people .the measure of success , the time period to get there and the importance of it are things which are distinct to every individual .the world might view a bill gates or a laxmi mittal as a successful person but for me my father is the most successful person i know .so i proceed on the assumption that we are referring to a successful person with reference to the economics of it and not to the essence of it .successful people seldom think of the consequences of risk as they have seen and endured the climb up the ladder of success and know exactly what it entails to get there .the sweat , the toil , the experience in itself gives them the energy to dream further and those dreams accompanied by the passion to get there remove all apprehensions to take any risks .they take risks to try new things , things that probably intrigue them or things that they have always dreamed of achieving and did not have the capacity to achieve earlier .having achieved a level of performance in what they already know how to do well they aspire to venture into new avenues and if the same involves taking a calculated risk they would not abstain from it .risks are essential if one needs to evolve as a professional or as a person-these are not the words of a luminary but views that i personally ascribe to .to discover new things , new worlds , new prospects and new ideologies , taking risks is something that should not be seen as a negative attribute but a positive one .apprehensions or fears can bring in a life which will always lack the drive and passion that make business barons like laxmi mittal and ambanis achieve their status .coming back to the topic of this essay , i would state that i do agree with the statement that `` succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  to the extent that it is not a restrictive statement .success is something subjective and i strongly believe that any person whether `` successful  by worldly standards or not would aspire to do new things and will take the risk to get there
