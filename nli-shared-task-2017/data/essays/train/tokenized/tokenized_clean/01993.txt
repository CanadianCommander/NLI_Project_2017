yes , i strongly agree with the statement .successful people always try news things , implementing them at a great risk .these people will always try to develop new ideas , implement them and create them incredible to the world .in the process , they keep an eye on the previous experiences they had , rather than the people who just think about how to do , what to do and what not to do .for example , the person who organise & co-ordinate the events for the first time , does nt get good appreciation for the work he did due to lack of experience .but , he is successful because he has done the program to his best and even gets lot of satisfaction .moreover , he even gains the managerials skills , responsibilty to face the failures , communication skills interacting with other people around the world like getting sponors for the event , as a part of process .moreover , he can even get the managerial skills like managing the things effeciently and do the things in time with consistence .later on , he goes with the same project next year with all his previous expericenes and oragnises the event successful making an incredible work , none yet done ever before .he even gets lot of support and encouragement from his fellow humans who guide him all the way along motivating him to the desired field of his interest .the successful people are the only people who takes responsibilty and risk factors beyond the imagiantion .moreover , the positive attitude , zeal to work hard for long hours and getting pratice in that particular course of study gives much detail information , knowledge , expericence and satisfaction .thus , he is the successfull person rather than the person who doesnt do anything and doesnt work hard to get success and progress .instead , the unsuccessful people just thinks about what to do ? , how to do ?and what not to do ?the unseccessful people doesnt get progress as they are not interested and concern with that particular program or event being irresponsibility .finally , the successful people get much appreciation for their incredible work , implementing new things with a major risk factor .whereas the unsuccessful people never get progress in their lifetime .
