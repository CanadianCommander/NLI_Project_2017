knowledge is not measured based on the amount of general things you know , but on the quality of the information you count on .many people consider that wise beings are those who know a small amount of information about everything .however , true knowledge is measured by the deepness of thoughts and ideas .by having a broad knowledge of many different areas , we wo nt be able to go deep into a specific topic , and therefore , we wont be able to create a valuable conclusion .nature is developed in such a way in which each trait is specialized in one single action .just as nature , we must use our knowledge to specialize in certain things , rather than to have a general idea about a wide variety of things .the human body , for instance , is divided into different organs that are specialized into specific fuctions .as a result , all organs work together to be able to form the body and to work properly .the purpose of nature is efficiency , and the purpose of knowledge is to be able to apply it to draw a conclusion .the world in which we live in is divided into different areas of work that performs certain tasks .just as well , this is carried out in such a way to be able to perform certains actions and conclude ideas .if we limit ourselves just to know about general things , we wont be able to strengthen on specific things .in order to emphasize in one specific subject , a general knowledge of others things is needed .this is why for example , in real world , we first go to school and then we specialize into a specific area by going to college .we all make part of a big idea , but we must all carry out specific actions to be able to make a global change in the general ensemble .in conclusion , the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  is not appropiate , since it is better to have the ability to dominate a specific subject than to know general aspects about it that wo nt permit us to go beyond what s obvious .
