i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .when people are young they always want to challenge things , and are very energetic .however older people have to work , to maintain their lifestyle and has already become calm .therefore i believe young enjoy life more than older people .i will explain my reasons in the following essay .young people are always trying to do new things so they are very active which makes them enjoy their life .generally young people dont have to think about others and just think about their own life .therefore they can do whatever they want to do .for instance , if they want to go on a trip just to disocover something , they can do it easily .however if they get older and have a family to support , it will become difficult for them to do so .when people are young they have many chances and opportunities to change their future lives .thus they can just do what they want to do .and when people do what they want to do , they enjoy their lives to the fullest .older people generally already have a job and some have families .therefore it makes them hard for them to have the time to do their hobbies , or to travel .and to support their families , they have to make a lot of money so it is not easy to quit their jobs just to challenge their dreams .older people can not just do what they want to do because it would affect many other things .as they in a stricted situation , it is difficult for them to enjoy their lives .in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do .it is very difficult for older people to do what they want to do because it effects other things such as their family .however young people dont have to think about those things and can challenge whatever they want to do .therefore i believe young people enjoy life more than older people .
