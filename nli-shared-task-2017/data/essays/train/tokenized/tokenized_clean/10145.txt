i agree ; because many academic subjects are going to improve the knowlege of the students , to get more information in regard to what does happen arround the word ; in addition the other subject that are not on the major is to make the students how can their specific subject contibute to others areas .the first idea is to get more information that the academic people had gotten in a specfic subject .this is important because the students would be interested in regard to others assignatures like politics , economics , urbanism , etc .those assignatures are called `` general subjects  .then when the students study those subjects , they learned about what happened arround the world .this means what are the causes that the facts success and the consequences ( good or bad ) these gave .for example : in my country , my major is computer engineering and the last term i learned about the urbanism , and the progression of the cities arround the world , the causes of these progresses in regard to the health and organization abuot the building and houses .the results to this topic is to improve the student in regard to how can the specifics subject contribute to these .this is the best part , because it make to built the answers in regard to the fact .in addition in my example : i can to reorganize the reality of the city , to help the government housing plan ; other could be , to vreate a tridimensional video to help the urbanism professors , experts and/or students ; or build a video-game about the race , war , trip , etc .i said in the beginning that this statement can help to the students to increase the information about the world .
