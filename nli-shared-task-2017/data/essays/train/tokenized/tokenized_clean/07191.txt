i think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and concepts .my choice is based on two reasons .the first reasons is that , if you learns facts , you have a direct contact with the reality .for example , in the university , you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than you follow a lesson of theory .this is a good way not only for a student , but also for a worker .in fact , if a worker has worked all of the day , he or she learn more things than he or she follows a lesson of theory .i know my uncle s experience that can be taken as an example .in fact , he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry , but he has learn the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry .the second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying .for example , i remember that , when i follow the course in the `` way of transport  , the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken me of how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built togheter .to conclude , i do nt agree with the sentence because it is not true that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts .
