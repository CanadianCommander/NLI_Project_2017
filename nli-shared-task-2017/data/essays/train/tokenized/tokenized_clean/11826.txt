a key to answer to this question is to think about the different pourposes of study .certainly , a specialization in a specific academic topic is essential to do any research .first because the specialization brings to a more deep knowledge , and then to a better comprehension .besides , if you want to say any orginal thing concerning a subject , you will have to know almost all has already been done or written .in this sense , a focalized study is foundamental .on the other hand , if you want to reasearch , a broad knowledge is surely useful .your mind will be more open , and outside of your topic you will find diffent approach to problems that can help you .you will may also bring ideas from other fields to your specific one .you will be able to use the analogy to resolve you problems , that is a very powerful method .from these observations , is surely better not to specialize .if the pourpose of the study is merely to stay in the world with more instruments , a person that has studied many different topics will be more cultured .so he or she will be in a better position than anyone that has nt studied or that has studied only one thing .it will also be more difficult to betray him or her .whatever are your pousposes , if you do nt stop studying , you will be always curious , and your brain will always be active .concernig this , there two other reasons that support the idea of not to restrict the fields of interest .once you have read all has been written on you topic , will you be able to start studying a different subject , or , on the contrary , you wo nt ?it is known that any different topic involves a different part of brain ; it is vital for the development of the whole brain not to specialize , but to learn about very different subjects , like music , literature , sciences .on conclusion , is better not to spend all you efforts on only one topic , but to study how much subjects as you can .it will help you in your work , in your life , and will keep safe longer your brain .
