in my view , in twenty years from now will be more cars in use than today .so i disagree the fewer cars in future .first , it will be changed that people buy a car more cusually .although , people started concidering environmentally friendly socity , like recomending a pubulic transportation , bus or subway .more atracting having a own car nowaday .many car company are very competitive , producing a nice , new modle stayl every year to attract consumers thouth a media , televison , internet .and a cost of per car has been aceptable for even young single person .fortermore , a life of each family member might be more imdipendent .havind a car for as personal belings will be possible in nearlly future .second , new nutural enegy or electronics engine have been found instad of oil gas .new type of car only uses a little oil and conbine electronic enegy and it is already useig some region .they are low cost and environmentally harmless for earth .finally .i assum that even a lot of cars in future dose not pollute as much as used to be .but more number of cars will appear .and i disagree that it will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
