in an age of mass production and consumption , manufacturers engage in a harsh competition to survive .the consumer wants to know that he is getting the most out of his investment and may rely on advertisements to decide which product would be the wisest purchase .it is then no surprise that when companies advertise their products , they focus on its benefits - perhaps exaggerating them - and rarely disclose its shortcomings .advertisements of beauty products are a good example of this type of embellishment .the consumer wants a mascara that will lenghten , define , and thicken her eyelashes without making them appear clumped together .all cosmetic companies know this and , year after year , advertise a new mascara designed to do all this .dramatic pictures shown on television or printed in magazines display its unique ability to thicken thicken , but never mention that this same technology also leads to a clumping or , worse , shedding of eyelashes .if the companies mentioned these side-effects , who would buy this revolutionary mascara ?this scheme seems to be working , since the new formulas keep entering the market every year , and women are still buying them !diet pills are also advertised as being much more effective and safer than truly are .the typical advertisement shows pictures of ( pretended ) consumers before and after using the miraculous product .of course , the `` after  pictures are always taken in a more flattering light , with the happy customer wearing better-fitting clothes and often sporting a tan .they are also digitally enhanced , to the point that one may come to doubt whether these people have even lost any weight or used the diet pills .in any case , the pictured consumers appear thinner , healthier , and happier .but do diet pills really bring about such formidable changes ?advertisers conveniently omit the need to balance diet and exercise in order to maintain a healthy weight and the customer is more than happy to purchase an easy solution .just the same , the makers of these diet pills typically mention the possible side-effects in small print , while the numerous advantages of their products are spelled out in bright , bold letters .finally , even if these diet pills are effective , the customer hoping to gain a better self-esteem and happiness may be very disappointed .after all this person has not changed his or her definition of personal worth along with a new , shapelier waist .in conclusion , manufacturers must resort to somewhat dishonest practices in order to sell their products .however , i do nt believe this is done specifically to dupe the consumer , but simply as a matter of economic necessity .it remains the consumer s duty to understand this and to develop a more realistic understanding of what a product can and can not do in order to critically examine an advertiser s claims
