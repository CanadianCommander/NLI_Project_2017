i do agree with the statement .but i have to moderate my claim .coming out of the university , i can see i have learn a lot of things , and i have forgotten an equal number of it .what will stay after passed years ?the ideas , and the concepts .in courses , it , s really important to learn a way to think .not the same as the professor s one , but its own one guided by teachers experience .so , is the knowledge unusefull ?certainly not .in order to develop his own way to learn , the student needs strong basis .if he does nt have good instalements , his science building is going to fail .in the elementary school , we already have to set up those strong basis .otherwise , the only way to build up a good mental structure is to receive examples to learn .how to understand a car is riding without knowing how works an engine .the knowledge is also important to be able to make connections between different areas , to compare some stuffs .as an archeologist discovering some news objects .he needs to know how was the environment , the atmosphere to figure out how those objects could be usefull for peoples who lived there .in belgium , we have this big issue in the high school level .actually , we try to reduce the knowledge of students and to give us more skills an abilities .but the college professors start to mean their students come into their courses with too big lakes .so , there is an emergency in finding the best middle way between pure knowledge and skills .i think that the more we grow up , the more we have to leave knowledge to get a lot of abilities and concept .at the and of college , student get very various jobs and have to learn again what is typically needed for their domains .so we never stopped to learn , and college is there to give us concpets .
