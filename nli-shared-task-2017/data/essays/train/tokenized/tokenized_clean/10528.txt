i agree with the statement .in my opinion , successful people are the ones who take more risk , try new things and in doing so think out of the box .there are many examples of such people who have been trendsetters and who are a feather in the cap of the classified league .let us look at mr. nr narayanmoorthy , who is the progenitor and edifice of a successful software company such as infosys .he started infosys with just 4 friends and a meagre sum of indian rupees ten thousand .he was actively involved in politics before he decided to switch over to the field of software .nobody in his wildest of dreams could have ever thought what narayanmoorthy did .his decision was a bolt out of the blue for even his wife .but his acute vision and the guts to take calculated risk , scored over the potential dangers and uncertaintees of failure .we now understand what he achieved when we look back at his feats in totality .infosys today is a fortune 500 company and india s first company to be listed on the nasdaq .dhirubhai ambani of the reliance group , kumarmangalam birla of the aditya birla group and many more business tycoons from india stand testimony to the above fact .we can find such people in every field .amitabh bacchan from the field of entertainment and indian film industry is a living legend and has shaped indian cinema in a way by taking immense risks .when there was aromantic spate he differed and started the angry young man conceptsuch people actually change the course of history and chart a new history .they bring about monumental changes and thereby create history .they serve as lighthouses for similar people with similar attitudes .successful people have strong vision , desire to succeed at any cost , focussed thoughts , tremendous zeal and enthusiasm for persistence and loads of confidence to back them up .they in fact resemble the person who was told that he would not be able to sell shoes on an island because people do not wear shoes and he retorted with the answer that this was why exactly he would be easily able to sell shoes on the island .mahatma gandhi , of india who is considered to be the father of the nation liberated india from the british regime because he had tremendous ability to take risk in the right way and changed the face of the revolution .we can think of president bush in the united states , who has taken tremendous risk by bombing iraq and avenging the dastardly acts of the terrorists in the sep 9/11 attacks .he probably faced immense opposition and criticism and he could have stayed silent , but he decided to get down the laid track and do something radical .this has brought about tranquility in the us and has shown the cudgel to those who feel that th us is a soft target .several leaders in the field of business such as bill gates , warren buffet etc .th
