i agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities for three reasons ; too busy to participate , priority in helping their communities is very low , and fact that existence of community itself is questionable .first , the young people do not devote their time for helping their communities becase they are simply too busy .there are things they need to do in order for their dream to come true .for example , i put in a time in my acadmic work in order to achieve enough grade to be accepted to the university i wished for .on top of this , i participated in three different sports team , so that the universities knew that i was an active member of school .and on top of this , i had attended to the sat prep course to maximize my score .i just did nt have time to spend time in the community volunteer .secondly , the young people s priorities are usually in different direction , so that they do nt even pay attention in helping their communities .i sure was not a kind of teenager to give up my time to help communitity instead of going out with a girl who i liked .the range for the definition `` young people  is some what ambiguous , but its very likely that people in their teenage choose their private and personal life over helping their community .the reason is very simple ; they like private life better and feel excitment .lastly , the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , because young people ca nt find the community itself .it s not just young people , who ca nt find community , i believe people nowadays do not rely on community at all , that their existance might have been forgotten .especially in the city life , it s possible for someone to not to interact with anyone or anything to retain your lifestyle .
