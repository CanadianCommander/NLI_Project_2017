in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects gives us a lot of information about various topics .this helps us to identify the area or subject in which we are interested .for example , an individual who has knowledge in arts , history , economics and sciences will have a larger scope to select his interested area of study and pursue his higher education in that domain .but by specializing in one specific subject , the scope of selection of other interested subjects is lost .also , broad knowledge of various subjects gives us a larger scope for inter-disiplinary work .having considerable knowledge of two inter-relating topics , can help us understand the subjects much better .for example , having knowledge of mathematics can help a lot in studying physics .modern world demands integration of more than one technology .also , it would improve the job oppurtunities .as the world moves towards development , the companies which hire individuals wants them to be flexible enough to work on more than one project at a time .individuals who have broad knowledge of various academic subjects are helpful in this regard .moreover , having knowledge of more than one subject will always be helpful in job search .also there are certain jobs which require the knowledge of more than one subject .for example , for an effective design of an automobile , it would be better to hire a person who have knowledge of mechanical engineering and also who can simulate designs on a computer system there by reducing the manufacturing costs by a great deal .from the above facts , i conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of various academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .we need individuals who are multi-talented to make innovations and make society a better place to live .
