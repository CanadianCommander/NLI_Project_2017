young people enjoy life more than older people do .this statement makes us wonder how can one define enjoyment .being subjective not only from person to person but also from time to time , enjoyement in totality refers to satisfaction of ones expectations and desires .in the case of older people , who have `` enjoyed  the best of their youth , old age brings about a sudden restriction in terms of what they are capable of doing and what they must learn to live without .no one welcomes this change but some find a way to remain satisfied and happy in there restricted lives .these older people continue to enjoy life .but we find that they form a minority .in the case of young people , faced with limitless possibilities , aspirations and expectations are soaring high .these youngsters are willing to do whatever it takes to have a good time .they defy rules , and set new boundaries for themselves to try and cross .life for them is like a window .their expecations represented by the horizon and their desires by the distance from the window to the horizon .they can only do so much while their youth lasts .comparing the two , we notice that while the youth end up enjoying more than most older people ; in comparison with the limit to which they could have enjoyed , the older people have a higher sense of satisfaction .they know their boundaries and make the most of their lives eachday .almost everyone enjoys their youth , but people who can learn to enjoy their old age aswell are the people who have truely enjoyed `` life  .so in conclusion , i would like to say that young people enjoy `` youth  but older people enjoy `` life  .
