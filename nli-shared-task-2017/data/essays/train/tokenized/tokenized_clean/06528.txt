the world is having the things that is more enjoyable .in my view there is no difference between the old age people and the young age people to enjoy there life .moreover i think young people are doing more enjoy than old people .i support my openion in the folowing ways .young people are going to college in there regular life they had lot of friends .in the college they chat with the friends and eat a meal in the restaurent .they play games with the friends .for exampls some of the games like basket ball .which needs a lot of strenth .i think young people having that strenth rather than the old people .always young peoples are having an habbit to drive a bikes .it also needs a lot of musscle strenth .always the young people are having that strenth so , they are enjoyed a lot .for example they go out side of the city along with their girl friends .this is also one type of enjoyment .moreover the main important difference among young people and the old people is experience .the young people are not experienced and the old people are experienced .there experience does not allow them to spend a lot of money for enjoyment .the young people are not like that .they spend more money for enjoyment .in my view there is no enjoyment without money .on the other hand the old people also enjoy a lot .they are playing with there grand children .they are playing a soft games like in door games .in this way the grand parents are enjoying .by seeing all of the above expressions .i conclude that young people are doing more enjoy than older people .
