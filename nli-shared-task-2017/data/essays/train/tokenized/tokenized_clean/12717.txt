as a matter of fact i think we first start with the term young , who are young people , to count a young people should we in a certain range of age or should we distinguish certain behaviours .we all leave in a global interacting society , as humans we all have functions for the development our social and culturel life , as i m trying to say you can not society into parts ( like young or old ) you uoght to think as a whole .people do not leave alone mostly they live in crowded cities .on this cities you are in an interaction with the rest these could be either young or old .sharing a place to live with others means rules for society order preservation .these rules could be written ; like laws or could be unwritten like cultural conventions or practices .the one who didnt came against these rules ought to live untouched .it is easy to blame or recriminate each other for behaving in an un acceptable way .instead of this tpe of behaviour we should requestion themselves both as an old or a young member of the society .we first try to find the mistake on ourselves than putting the blame on other side .if there s a clash between young and old members of the society both sides shoul held the problem together and try to find a solution together , as this problem may not giving enough time for their communities or not doing their obligations .we can say if there is a problem this all ours we should solve it with all parts of the society
