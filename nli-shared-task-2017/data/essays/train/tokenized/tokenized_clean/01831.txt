if you had opportunity to travel favorite country or place , i predict you would be happy and excited before you take a trip .however , what would happen if the cost of trip is expensive , or if you do not have enough time to see places where you want to see ?it would possibly happen if you choose to travel with a tour guide .to avoid this fact , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide , to travel individually .taking trip with a tour guide is usually more expensive than individual trip .for example , the tour guide company prepares everything for customers such as booking planes , hotels , restrant , buses or cars , anything neccesary for trip .on the other hand , if you prepare the trip by yourself , it could be cheaper .it is beacuse you might able to find cheaper plane tickets , cheaper hotel , etc .if we count on the tour guide company , we might have to pay more because earning money from customers is for thier business .if you travel with a tour guide , you might not able to visit places where you are interested in .it is because traveling as ` tour  means already has route to see places .when i was 12-year-old , my family and i went to france with a tour guide which was not good choice for me .we went to a art museum which was very boring place although i was hoping i would be able to get france soccer team uniform and visit any soccer stores .finally , i could not buy or visit any because of ` tour  .from my thoughts and experiences , i believe the best way to travel is individual trip .it is because it would be cheaper , and you might not satifsy the plan of tour .
