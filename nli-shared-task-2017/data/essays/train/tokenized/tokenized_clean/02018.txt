recent research say that to void to get older , you need to keep yourself young .i am still young , but i love reading and i love to see the eyes of older people giving advices , hugging other people , or walking on the streets .the sadness usually pervades each of their actions .usually my grandfather loves talking about his life when he was young .why ?the most obvious reason is that he felt more alive .his bones , his articulations , arms and legs , were strong and flexible .but also his heart was stronger and flexible .a short italian movies called `` per sempre  ( for ever ) talks about a lady who falls in love with a married man who does nt love her in retourn , and she falls into a deep depression until the moment she wishes to die .might be happen if she were 15 years old ?i dont  think so .the art director in fact was a mature man , who understoods that after a certain age the antibodys of our spirit are not as many as when we are young .the perception changes .a year is much longer when we are 5 years old then we are 80 s .every experience changes us , and the time is not reversable , even if albert einstein discover and theoryze the relativity , but he never theoryzed any kind of `` back to the past  .an interesting aspect might be the illusion of immortality .maybe there is some kind of internal biological measure unit , just given by mother nature that says that at the age of 18 , rich or poor , well-educated or not , we are expressing the maximum potential of what we will be in our all life .we look around , and we are the best of the society , beautiful , strong , smart , and all the people talk about us with expressions as `` the next generation  .sometimes i like to stop by an old grandma , and i just like to dream about asking her phone number . ..but only if she were 20 !so i just start talking about the weather and ask about her life , her past , her youth .
