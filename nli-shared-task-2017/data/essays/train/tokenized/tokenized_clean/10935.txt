professional or general ?in our current society of learning and studying there are a lot of theories how to achieve the best result , how to get the best marks and how to get a well paid job .on the one hand some people think that specialising on a certain topic or subject and having an entire knowledge of it will be the solution to achieve the most .on the other hand there are people who think , that it is necessary to have a certain knowledge in many different subjects .both of these ways to prepare for life have their advantages and disadvantages .if you are specialised on one subject and you really know much , nearly everything , about it it is going to be easy for you to get a job in this area , because you are very well qualified .but therefore it is important that there are enough jobs to be offered in your area you are specialised on , because it is not appealing being a professional in your subject without having a chance for a job .but when you know much about many different subjects , but not as much as you would if you were specialised on each , it is also not easy for you to find a job , because maybe you are not qualified enough in the area that is required from the company .so you are not specified sufficiantly , albeit you know very much .in contrast there are also many companies that ask for such a general knowledge in many areas , so your chance for getting a job also depends on the kind of jobs which are offered .so there is the contrast between superficial knowledge in many subjects or entire knowledge of one specific subject .i am the opinion of that both things do not benefit getting a job .i think it is necessary to have broad knowledge in maybe two or three subjects which match together very well ( e.g. mathematics , physics and biology ) .but furthermore it is also important to have a certain based knowledge in some more subjects , but not as specialised as in the others .as result you will end up with different levels of knowledge in nearly every subject .with such a qualification i think it is going to be easier to emphasize your general knowledge and to get a job .
