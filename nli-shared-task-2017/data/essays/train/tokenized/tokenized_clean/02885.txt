i agreed with the statement .people who succeed try new things rather than doing what they have already know how to do well .we will learn new things and gain some experience by trying new things .these experience are precious .we can only gain them when we tried !and if it dose nt work or we are not satisfied with the result , we can keep on trying and trying until we are satisfied .i have heard of a phrase `` people who are successful find solutions to solve their problem and people who are in failure try to find reasons for their problems  and i think this phrase really makes sense .we should always find the solution to solve our problems rather than finding reasons for the problems .for example , a man named tony .he opened a bakery selling only toast and water .plain toast and water .no one wants to come to his shop because there are only toast and water .suddenly he decided to try new things .he decided to learn how to make begels , milkshakes and a variety of cakes such as tiramisu and chocolate cakes .he started to sell them after he have learned how to make them .after a month he earned lots of money after selling all these snacks .he became a successful businessman .the reason why the man had became a successful businessman is that he tried new things .and while he was trying , he also learned .i do nt think the man will become a successful businessman if he did not try and do things that he have already know how to do such as buying jam to put onto the toast or frying eggs .these are just a piece of cake even a children from kindergarden can do all these things !there is also another example .if we lose a job , why do nt we try another or open a business ?we can always try and there will be a day we succeed .in conclusion , agreed with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .
