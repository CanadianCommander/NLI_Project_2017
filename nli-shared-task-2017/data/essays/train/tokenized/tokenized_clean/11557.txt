this question being asked to me just a couple of years ago , i would have agreed completely .but in the last years i ve had the chance to experience several situations that lead me to believe that this tendence is changing .to me , it looks like that the world as a kind of natural security alarm , and when , over the last decades , the selfishness-altruism balance was starting to be overloaded on the selfishness part , an altruist essence has started to spread over western societies .of course i m sure not all the society has been affected by this phenomenon , but i could outline a couple of examples to make my idea more clear .first of all , i ve got to get in contact with the wide reality of voluntary work .i started with an internship with an italian non governmental organization of international volunteering , and i ve been positively surpriesed to see how many young people want to get involved in the fight for a better world .a lot of students show their availability to work unpaid to make possible a lot of events , like exibitions , markets , debates , etc. , to collect fundings and to communicate the message of the value of human development .to look more closly , in italy it is possible to work for a year as social service volunteer , and , i m always surpriesed to see how many young people are willing to dedicate one year of their lives just to help disadvantaged people and organizations that work for the protection and the respet of every human being .almost all of my friends collaborate as volunteer in at least one association , and everyone of them affirms that his voluntary work is one of the few things that makes sense and gives satisfaction in everyday life .to summarize , i would said that just until few years ago it was true that young people did nt mind that much about helping their communities , but i do believe that this tendence is nowadays changing and young people are taking a more responsible direction .
