in my openion , successful people should try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .people can improve their skills , knowledge and achieve a great successthat can help them to become a famouse person .i have three reason to supprot my openion .reason first is if the successful person try new thing than that person can improve skills .if his / her work is more riscky than whtever he/she did before than that person can get more experience .for example , one ancient people investgate how to make a wheel out of wood .after that they made cart by using that wheel and they became successfull .after making a cart they did nt take any risk to make any equipment or any vehicle .so , do u think that we are able to use cars today ?no , we wo nt be able to use car but , they worked ahead and took risk and find more ways to use that wheel .theire skills of understanding increased by their risky work .second reason is if successful person try a new things and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well , than that person s expereince will become limited .that prson does nt know anything rather than he/she already know how to do well .for examle , if the person suceesfully become a teacher and after that he did nt read any source .than , his knowledge will become limited .if a student ask him question and that teacher will not be able to answer his question .only becouse he was satisfied with his success , he did nt studied anything accept whatever he studied during his school and university and he stoped reading .consequently , i strongly disagree with the statement about
