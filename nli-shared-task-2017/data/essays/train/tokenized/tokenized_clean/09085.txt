the statement about most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .i agree about this point , i agree because this is from my experience in my life , when i saw some new product advertisement from the televioson , it always attract me , and i felt a urage from myself , i want to own that product .i want to bacome the same as they show it on the televison , but when i saw them from the shop or when i purcheased them , i found not very effective or same as they advertise .for example .the shampoo , we always see the model show their hair in the advertisements , it look like a falls .beautiful , shinning , but when you buy and use it , no doubt , toally different hair from the advertisemenrt , i think the same or similar examples are not difficult to find in your life .so most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .so some people will say , it is fake , it destory the rights of customer , but this is a stratege of business .when they use some computer technique to change amd make much better than original product , it will encourage their product an oppertunity , people see their new product s advertisement and it appeal people , then thay will go to the shop , that is an oppertunity to let the people `` feel  their product and that can see what it is looks like , they can touch that product and thay will considear about thay willing to buy it or not .advertisement is not a directly way to show the quanty of that product is good or not .it just want make interested of people and appeal tham , and let them know that product , and give an oppertunity to touch and get close to their product .this is an stratege of busniess .
