i do not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .to my mind , it is true that successful people are willing to take risks , but i think that they balance out advantages and disadvantages of an occasion better than people who are not as successful .they apply their knowlege to the topical situation and know how to cope with it .most likely successful people have had many experiences and thus have learned when they can take risks and when it is too dangerous .stereotypically , successful people are wealthy and thus have to consider their capital .as a contrast to these people , i think that people who are not as successful are willing to take more risks , in order to become successful because to their mind it might be their last chance to reach what they have worked for .in my opinion , they do not have to care as much about any disadvantages or about the risks certain steps bring along .they do not have as much to loose as very successful people .however , there is another group of successful people : the successful people who only see the money , the success and the fame and therefore take any risk without considering negative effects .they are willing to risk a good working climate and even friendships to become more and more successful .these carrierists are very ambitious and most likely very egoistic , too .they just see the benefit for themselves and do not care about anybody else .to my mind one can not divide people in risk taking successful people and careful non successful people .it always depends on the situation they face .if it is someone s last chance to rescue a company , even the most careful successful person might consider taking the risk .and on the other hand a non successful person might not take a risk because of any consequences , even if there is not as much to loose .
