i disagree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one .all of us have heard of the quote `` jack of all trades , master of none  .i think i would like to be the master of atleast one subject .i believe that unless one has detailed or specialized information regarding a subject , it is difficult to speak challengingly on that subject .to quote myself as an example , i have a broad knowledge of seven languages .i speak english at college , telugu at home which an indian regional language and have learnt a smattering of french , german , hindi ( india s national language ) , spanish and italian .but , i am handicapped when i have to converse in atleast five of the seven languages i learnt which does nt serve the purpose of learning .i also believe that specialization is required in most fields .some of those fields being engineering , medicine and law .when you have a toothache , you would visit a dentist rather than a general practicioner .a similar logic would drive you to a cardiologist when you have a heart attack and to an opthamologist when one has a problem with one s eyes .hence , it can be seen that in the above cases , a person with broad knowledge of the ailments would serve no purpose as one requires specialists .another area where i want to illustrate the use of specialists is engineering .civil engineers are required for building bridges and computer engineers are required to work on computers .a non-specialized engineer would simply do a bad job or a blotched job .we could also consider the field of law as an example .we approach criminal lawyers for fighting our cases in case of crimes such as murder , extortion or kidnapping but we would approach a consumer court lawyer for problems such as adulterated food .thus , we infact need specialists all the time and in all walks of life !another advantage of being a specialist is that people look up to your opinions much more than if you were un-specialized .we would much rather believe a person who has obtained his doctor of philosophy degree in a particular subject rather than an undergraduate student .hence , i believe a broad knowlegde of several subjects does nt really serve many purposes .infact , it might even be dangerous .have nt we all heard of the saying `` half-knowledge is dangerous  ??an intern might suggest a wrong course of treatment to a patient which could have a fatal affect .such affects are not limited to medicine alone .thus , i believe in specialization and aim for that kind of approach in all my endeavours .
