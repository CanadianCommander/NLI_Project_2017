from my point of view , i totally agreed this statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do .nowadays , a great many phenomena demonstrated that many youngsters are enjoying their golden life time than elder people .i can lists them more reasonablely as following .first of all , we should accepte this turth about the limits on human s energy during their whole life-span .as a matter of factor , young people have more physical energy than elders .an increasing number young people can have extra energy to enjoy their beautiful life with many methods .for instance , they can make a wonderful trip or visiting to various places as also go overseas .let take my own experience for example , in this summer , i had a wonderful trip to five different countries of europe , including germany , switzerland , france , netherlands , as well as beligum .at same time , i took total sixteen days to visit the berlin wall , lourve museum and also many famous historical sites and fantastic landscape .both of them can demonrtrate a young people has enough energy to enjoy life .the second reason is from financial aspect of a person s daily life .young have the economic ability can offer their expense on entainment , trip and any kinds of abilities for their life enjoying .from the statistical data of personal expense all over our country in the first three months of this year , alomst 85 % young people can offer themself on enjoying life while only 15 % in old people .as far as i am concerned , everyone can enjoy their lifetime both young peole and aslo the old people .we both have wonderful lifetime and various kinds of abilities can related to enjoying our life .but i do believe our young people can make full use of this opportunity to enjoy the fantastic world than old peoples .
