i disagree with this statement .when you see the evolution of the number of cars in twenty years , is constantly growing .that is why i do not think that that in twenty years after there will be fewer cars in use .car represents one of the most important product of consumption .the majority of people in developed countries has a car because it is confortable , easy to go everywhere and mainly to go at work .in countries like united states , cars are necessary because distances are very big .many families in united states have two cars and americans generally learn very early to drive .the main problem of car is that it consumes petroleum .this energy is more and more difficult to find and it costs a lot of money .car represents too one of the major causes of pollution and which provoques environement s degradations .so with all this factors can we considers that in the fututre there will be less cars in use than today ?i do not thin so .car s ingeneers invent prototypes of cars which will be differents than today s cars .and i think that in the future there will be cars with another type of energy like hydrogen .so as carconstructors find solutions to make non pollution cars
