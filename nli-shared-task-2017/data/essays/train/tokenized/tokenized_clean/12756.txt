i disagree with this opinion .cars are developing better and more conveniently recently .there are navigations and you can watch tv on the car when you rest to drive a car .if there is navigation , you do not get lost , and you do not have to bring a map .when you drive somewhere , and you can not find somewhere to stay , you can stay in a car .if there is tv in the car , you are not bored .most of cars have music players .they are high quality and clear sound .recently cars  technologies are getting safer and more comfortable .some cars let you know when you almost hit walls and people .the way of driving became easier than before .it was difficult to drive cars before .because it is complicated to move cars before and it is dangerous to drive .it is difficult to control speed and if you make mistakes to control , car stopped suddenly .but there is two types of to control cars , manual and auitomatic cars .manual cars are old style to control .but it is easier to drive automatic cars than manual cars .automatic cars are easy to control and safe .you can control speed easily and when you make mistakes to control , cars will not stop suddenly .recently there are small cars .you do not hit walls easily with small cars .in contrary , there are big cars too .you can let many your friends and your family in a big car .you can have fun to spend time with many friends and family in a big car .there are fasionable cars recently .their colors are various .there are blue , red , yellow , purple and any beautiful colors .some cars  inside is decorative like club , and you can listen to music loudly .they are popular with young people .
