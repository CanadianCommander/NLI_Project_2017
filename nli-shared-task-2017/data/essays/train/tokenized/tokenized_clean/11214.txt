the important issue under consideration is the use of cars in future say twenty years from now .i would like to agree with the statement that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .it may seem a little surprising but there are numerous advances and happenigns which support this view .one of the important reasons for the reduction in number of cars in near future is goign to be the oil .judging by the recent trends in oil prices it would be almost impossible for common person to own a personal car .there is a goign concern about the limited petroleum reserves on which presently our automobiles run .the suggested replacements like solar cars electric cars are nt a very viable option right now .going by the trend it would take them few decades to mature into consumer products which afford the same flexibility .secondly beside the fact about the fuel shortages there is a growing concern for the harmful effects of the emmissions on the enivironment .this has led to planning of better public transport system and novel ways like car pools to reduce the emissions and use the resources efficiently by bundling together people goign to similar places at the same time .hopefully newer ideas like shuttles bullet trains ertc might help to cater to the transport needs of the increase in population .such awareness would reduce the number of cars on road .maybe we might get the technology to teleport liek star trek in few decades just a whimisical thinking .thirdly there is a major problem of congestion .the public roadways in most places is nt geared to handle such huge traffics and the government does nt have fuinds to improve them further .there has been an increase of over 300 % in the number of cars in my city new delhi only .this translates into more jams and delays in the work schedules .there is also a growing problem of parking space .the metropolitians are already too crowded to afford a parkign space prsently itself .an average oiffcie goer in cannaught place new delhi has to park his car on an average two kilometers away .the situation in future is nt goign to provide incentive to the people to buy new cars .this is further aggravated by the number of accidents .a recent study conducted by the delhi transport authority shows a disturbing trend of increase in number of accidents over the period of ten years .this translates directly into loss of life and property .hence it is expected that in future the number of cars would actually go down .but finally and most importantly with the advent of internet it might actually be possible that people do nt need to travel out that often .we might just do our shopping over ebay or order deliveries from our home .the facilities of teleconferencing and videoconferencing might go a long way and remove the use of actual transport of oneself physically oevr to the other palce .we already have succesful examples of oursourcing .these may be further modeled into working from home .schooling can be done oevr internet .children migth get lectures and assignments sittign at home .they can reference huge databases for their assignments .we can for example get our compete bank accounts over net in case of icici .we can but airline tickets or stuff using our visa credit card .this would reduce the need of edxtra trips to work place shopping malls and schools .this would translate into lesser use of private owned car thus the futility of owning one .the idea of lesser cars in next twenty years is based on the fatc that we humans would like to make this environment better and make the best use of the technologicval advances thereby reducing the number of cars on the road .
