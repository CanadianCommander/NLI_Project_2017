this quetinos reminds me of my father who passed away two years ago because he said before about this topic .this question gives me what worth life is for me .i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .first of all , you people have more opportunities to get someting .for exaple , young adulthood can try someting new such as new field of studying in colleges or universities for their purpose .they can study abroad for a better life .also , young people can join a lot of activitives with many people even if some activities are dangerous they can do .in other words , they can be satisfied with their life .however , most old people can not stand for a long time to do something such as studying new fields or joining clubs with new people .in addition , i think young people s health is better than older people s , so young generation can try more than older people for their happy time .for example , young adulthood can go a long distance for a long time for traveling or challenging , they can easily endure some risks and hardships .therefore , they can enjoy more to spend time for travelling in the world .in contrast , old people usually have diseases and show weak to do someting .also , they always need someone who help them to live without thinking about lesire time because it is difficult to do someting as a patient .finally , young people can meet many people such close friends relaltved jobs or colleges .because most of young people have many friends who still live near surrounding them .they can share their emotions and ideas for a their enjoyable life .meeting people makes them more energetic and dynamic .on the other hand , old people can not share their time with close friends like young adulthood becaus most of friends passed away or live far away from them .they often feel longly and stay alone without having a enjoy time .i know a few old people have opportunities and a time like young people for enjoyable life , but it is not many .it is true .my father said to me , before he passed away , it was difficult to enjoy travelling and doing someting , i know why he memtiond like this .therefore , i belive that young people enjoy life more than the old .
