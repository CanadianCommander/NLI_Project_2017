a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would provide breadth of knowledge .as against this , specialization in one specific subject would provide depth of knowledge .in my opinion , a person should obtain a broad knowledge of many academic subjects while pursuing undergraduate studies and must specialize in one specific subject while pursuing post graduate studies .undergraduate studies are generally undertaken by students in the formative years of their life .if at this crucial juncture , a student is not given an opportunity to explore a variety of areas , his learning process may be stinted .if a student is encouraged to study many academic subjects , he will be able to decide his area of interest .further , he will understand the interdependence and interrelatedness of different academic subjects .pursuing many academic subjects would help the student to obtain a functional knowledge in all the subjects he studies .such a strategy would prove to be useful as the student will have flexibility of choice , when it comes to choosing his subject of specialisation .for example if a student is pursuing graduation in finance , by studying banking , corporate finance and equity research , he will get a functional knowledge of all the areas in finance .he may choose courses in banking or equity research while pursuing his post graduate studies .post graduate studies are undertaken by students who have completed their graduate courses .post graduate studies equip a student with specific skills that the student will need , when he seeks employment .a person can not be `` a jack of all trades , but a master of none  .hence it is advisable for a student to choose one specific subject of his liking and specialize in it .this would help him acquire expertise and mastery over one specific subject .if a student were to study only one course in his undergraduate studies , say for example corporate finance , he may not be able to understand the effect of banking on corporate finance .on the contrary , if the student has dwelved in corporate finance and banking in his undergraduate studies , he will be able to correlate the impact that banking has on corporate finance .thus , in my opinion , a person should follow an approach , whereby broad knowledge of many academic subjects is obtained in undergraduate studies and expert knowledge in one specific subject is obtained in post graduate studies .
