it is good to have knowledge on many academic subjects , however , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledge is questionable .in my opinion , specilizing in one specific subject will bring lots of good academic works .suppose that you are a person who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .this means that you studied a lot and learned a lot of things .but first question appearing is that does that person really need that amount of knowledge ?and , more importantly , by using that knowledge , can he focus on the topics properly ?i claim that speclization will bring efficiency , time management , and gains in focus .for instance , in societies , almost everybody is specialized on a specific job .in other words , as a rational people , everybody wants to do the job in which he has a comperative advantage .by doing so , not only the person will be happier but also the society will be more close to a pareto efficient allocation .on the other hand ; if people know a broader knowledge of many things , then they might have some useless information and lose their focus on subjects .another example would be related to an academician s situation .when writing a paper , almost always specifing on a certain topic is as much as desirable .for instance .if that person specifies in the field of industrial organization and game theory , the papers that he will be writing will certainly be affected by the knowledge that he created in that field before .however ; if he focuses on different fields and tries to specialize in a lot of fields at the same time , there might emerge some problems regarging to the accumulation of knowledge in the future .everytime he writes on a specific area , he needs to focus on that field again , and this will take considerable amounts of time and bring inefficiencies .in conclusion , i think that it is better not only for people but also for societies to specilize on certain subjects .it might sound good to know everything at the first place , however , a deeper thinking on this topic shows that there might be losses on the time and efficiency concerns .
