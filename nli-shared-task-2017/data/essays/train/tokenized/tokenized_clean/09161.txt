i definately agree with the point , that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knw how to do well .successful people are not afraid to try new things , as because they are not afraid of faliure , because faliure is the key to one s success .for this i support a pre-proposed theory by darwin stated as the `` survival of the fittest  , according to this theory , only the ones how can compete and are the fittest are able to survive in an environment . ..the best habit of successful people is to compete , they compete with other people , not to prove they are smarrter or the other is duller , but they compete to enhance thier skills , take challenges , learn new things and live life to the fullest . ..successful people are called successful for taking risks and trying new things . ..a person isint called successful until he has stood up on his on feet and achieved through his hardowrk/pain .a person who gains his success by cheating/copying/taking help from others , isint really successful .there is only 1 way to sucess , which is hardwork , there is no easy formula , one has to work towards it , and if u do not expect things to quickly , you will finally find success .successful men also do not fear of the impossible , for them the word itself doesnt exist , because impossible itself says i m possible !! ...a person who backs off easily after seeing hurdles , difficulties in his path is a coward and sure not to succed in lifesuccess is someting one can not buy/trade .it has to be attained by one s self . ..hardwork is the only .a succeded man never fears of the wrong , because one can not be successful until he fails ,,, the other important quality of successful men is the quality to continue ahead . ..successful people do not take faliure as a road bloack in thier life and stop there for-ever . .instead they find ways to over come it , and to proceed in thier live s . .faliure is the begining of success . ..one can never be successful untill he/her hasent failed i life . ..it is from failures what people learn and becomse successfulhence i comclude this by saying that , success os written in every ones life . .it only depends on us to find the means to it . ..and the only means its hardwork . .no matter what you do , shorcuts always leads to downfall of a person . .< < < < < < < < < __ -- ~ ~ -- __the end __ -- ~ ~ -- __ > > > > > > > > >
