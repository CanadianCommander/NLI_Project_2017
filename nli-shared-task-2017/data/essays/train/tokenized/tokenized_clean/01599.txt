people need to move from place to place to carryout various daily activities .right from the existance of man on earth he has been nomadic , moving from place to place for food , shelter etc .so there must be some means of transport and those means changed as generations passed and as the technology developed .early man used to walk , later he used tamed animals like camels in deserts , horses etc and then he brought the revolutionary change when he invented wheel .almost all the current means of transportation are based on wheel and one such widely use means of transportation is the car .many people in the present society have cars and they use it daily to travel from home to office or elsewhere .so traffic has increased enormously .in the coming twenty years we will more cars if they increase the way they are now .but i believe that in the next twenty years cars will actually reduce because there are other means of transportation available such that everyone need not rely on only cars for travelling .technology has been growing along with requirements of people .now more public transport systems are available which are useful to the society and the facilities thay are providing are also increasing day by day .public transport systems like government and privide owned buses , public railway system , local trains and even aeroplanes have bettered their services and increased their frequencies .so instead of using cars many people now are looking into these means for their routine purposes like going to schools , colleges , offices etc .one more aspect of these public transport system is that they are a cheap and reliable means of transportation .it can help many people reach their destination with less risk and cost .governments are now introducing many policies to encourage people to use more of this public transport .many benefits have been advertised like lower bus fares for students and workers who travel regularly , benefits for elderly people etc .many fare concessions are advertised .one more reason why i feel cars will come down is that the effect these vehecles are having on our environment makes everyone to give a thought on using these vehecles .the pollution caused by these vehecles cause severe respiratory problems to the entire mankind .apart from such direct harm to health of humans it also pollutes the environment and leads to global warming .one good example to show that cars will come down in future is that countries like singapore and japan use more of bycycles rather than cars .they advocate people that use of bicycles is not only good for environment but also for our own health .their idea has already impressed many and in future many nations will definitely follow this .one more reason why i think we will see fewer cars in future may be because of the fuel constraints .even today many countries are having less rerserves of than what is required .the fuel prices have been growing higher and higher .so i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars considering the various reasons mentioned above .
