the lifestyles and activities of the young and old people are always compared .while the young people think that the way of life old people lead is slow and boring , old people complain about the speed of the young people s life .people , young or old , have a limited time to live . .in addition to this people should live their life full of enjoy and with activities .wecan clearly observe that there are more activity for the young people around .it can be seemed as a discrimination but it must be accepted that in today s world young people spend ore time at outside and also spend more money .in this situation it can be concluded that young people have more chance to enjoy life .on the other hand , what about the people whose age is old but young himself ?i mean that sometimes age does not the meaning of everything .person who has had a enjoyful life can continue his life in same way .in addition to this , the concept ` experience  is very important .when the people are young they do not have the chance of aware of what is true and wrong .therefore it is possible to make mistakes and destroy his life .ofcourse it is not something certain but even it is just a possibility it is a situation that must be thought on .on the other hand old people who had several mistakes before gains experience and make less mistakes .and in my opinion it is a good way of enjoying the life .another important thing is that enjoying life is also up to the preferences and ideas of the people .there can be young people who enjoy doing things that associated with the old people .for instance , a young person may not like the night life .instead of this he may prefer to dtay at home nd chat with family at nights .another example is fishing with a boat .most of the young people think that it is boring but it can be also a source of enjoy for a young person .in conclusion , it is important to belive in life and its beauties .if a person knows how to enjoy life it is not importanr if he is old or young .
