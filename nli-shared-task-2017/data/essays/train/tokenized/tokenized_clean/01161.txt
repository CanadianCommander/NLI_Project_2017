systems that academy adopts are much differents .some academy gives a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , and many academy gives a specialize in specific subject .two different ways to interpreter the wide range of teaching .in the first one you have a knowledge of many subject , but it could be a general preparation does not give you the right preparation of what you are studing for .in the second one , about the academy that prefers specialize the students in one specific subject , the risk is that they give to the society people who are able to work only in their specific subject .for example the ingeneers are very goods in their topics , their work could only be realised from theirself because is much difficult and it requires a particular preparation , but when you ask them to talk about art , or literature , or perhaps hystory they are not so good as in their specific subject .so i think that it could be better to prepare the students about many subject , but there is some subject that must be specialize .some academy divides the courses .for the first three years you reach a general preparation , and in the lasts two years you wil reach a specific preaparation .that is the case of myself .i am studying architecture in milan .here we have two kind of degree .the first level degree and the second level degree .the first level is long three years and you became a junior architect with many academic subjects .the second level is long two years and gives you a specific subject preparation .finally i think that the method adopted in my academy is may be one of the newest but it gives me the better preparation .
