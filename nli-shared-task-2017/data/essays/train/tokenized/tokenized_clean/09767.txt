i do not agree with the statement of fewers cars will be in use in the next twenty years than today .first of all , the cost of owning a car is decreasing by time .only few lucky families had cars 20 years ago .today , an average middle income family has more than one car .new technologies allow automobile companies to produce cheaper and better quality cars .not only cars are getting cheaper , income levels of the world economy is also increasing .for instance in developing countries with high population , such as china and india , gdp growth is more than ten folds during the last decade .imagine , if one forth of the population of india and china can buy a car , that will approximately sum up to 500 million new cars .that is the motivation behind the desire of buying new automobile factories in those countries .one argument against this statement may be the pollution effect of the cars .although conventional fuels create pollution , many scienticts work on projects which are trying to use alternative energy sources for transportation .electricity might be the major energy source for cars in the next twenty years , so enviromental problems related with car usage will be irrevelant .finally , individualism is another factor that will support car demand .people of 21th century enjoy to be different .people show their difference by their clothes , watches , cars etc .generally speaking one person s car shows his social identity .maybe in the crowded cities , people commute their offices by metro or bus , but this does not stop them buying cars .
