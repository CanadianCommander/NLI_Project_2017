more and more types of advertisements are being developed and improved , due to better knowledge and advanced technologies used by the professionnals in communication .today , everywhere you go , at anytime , everything you read , contains advertisements .in the newspapers , magazines , in the metro/bus stations , on am/fm stations , on tv commercials , on internet etc .our lives are surrounded by advertisements .the problem is that all what we see or hear about is not truly the exact product or service that the advertisement claims .the most accurate example is the advertisement of food , especially fast-food .in fact , the picture advertising a huge hamburger made with fresh ingredients , in a precised shape , at an affordable price , is not quite realistic .it gives you a feeling that it might be true , real and make you go and check it out .but when this perfect lunch is in your hand , you do not look at the picture in the same way !this is the main purpose of advertising : it is not only the opportunity to make people know about the company , but it is more about a product that we do not know , we do not necessarily need , but it looks attractive and accessible to all .also , with today s advanced technologies in designing and imaging products , it is even easier to show anything , anything but what you really sell .the actual hundreds ways to `` sculpt your body  , `` redefine your figure  , etc. using these new technologies in picturing perfect bodies , make the products seem to be the best and valuable , which is not .in conclusion , i can say that i do agree with the fact that what we see in everyday advertisements is very far from what we really get .in other words , everything that seems to be is not what it really is .
