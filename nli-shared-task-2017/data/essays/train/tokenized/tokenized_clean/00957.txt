every person enjoys life in his or her own way .though , i personally believe that youngsters enjoy life more than older people do .firstly , the reason why i think so is that as we grow older the responsibilities we have only get more and more .for example , when i was a kid studying nursery i didnt have any resposibility at all or for that matter very less .when i was in high school i had to study well to get admission into a good college .then in high school i had to get decent grades and also had to help my parents in their work .though it was not a burden for me , it surely was a responsibility which i had to do as their daughter .as a person grows their responsibilities also grow , not just as an individual but also as a person in the family and in the soceity .also most of the youngsters tend to take life in a lighter way than the older people .so we enjoy that phase of our lifethe most .the older people have already undergone things in life , that make them plan for their future in a certain way or save money for their family .but the young people tend to spend their money on luxurious things or on more enjoyable things .for instance , when i was in college i used to spend most of my money on shopping and stuff .that was enjoyment for me then .but now i realise the importance of saving money for the future and i shop only when i have the need for it .another important point i d like to mention is that enjoyement lies in the way we perceive it .most of the young people do not have anything major to worry about .they enjoy the life they are living , doing things at their own pace .all they have to bother about is their studies .this is not the case with the older people .their lives are more or less very stressful , be it due to family problems or tensions in the work place .in conclusion , i would say that a person enjoys his life the most when he is young .
