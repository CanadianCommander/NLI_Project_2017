`` old is gold  goes a famous quote .i disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .young people are always busy with something or the other , like completing assignments , heading for meetings etc etc .where as the older people , they completed every thing and now relaxed .for them there are no assignments to be finished or meetings to be attended .for example lets consider a young man and an old man .we will consider some of their daily routine .young man needs to wake up early like 5.00am in the morning go for a gym or jog to maintain his body .he should again rush to his home as he must get ready to attend his office or university .its a tight schedule .where as an old man , he can wake up whenever he wants , can go for a walk whenever he wants and can return leisurely .so who is enjoying life ?old man .now we will consider and old woman and a young woman .young woman. , she must also wake up early to go for a jog or a walk to remain fit and return to home quickly as she must go for an university or office , ofcourse there is an exception for housewives but if the housewives have children then again she is responsible for the child s upbringing .on the other hand the older woman can wake up whenever she wants and do whatever she wants as she has lot of time with her .some woman enjoy cooking so the old woman can try new dishes or she can write peoms do whatever she wants .so i strongly feel that older people enjoy life more than younger people .younger people are always associated with more responsibilities than older people , building up their career etc etc .
