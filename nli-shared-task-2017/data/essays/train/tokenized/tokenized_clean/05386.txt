well i strongly agree that for students it is more important to understand ideas and the concepts rather than learning only the facts .firstly , in our daily life , we come across many situations from which we are able to gain knowledge , and thus we learn the concepts and idea from that particular situation .just take an example of a school .i n school every student is suppose to study varieties of topics in various subjects .when we go on reading , we understand the concept , what that particular lesson implies , and after understanding that lessen we are able to evaluate our own ideas .we can even clearify all the doubts from our professor and then our mind becomes more clear and we are able to expand our ideas .but if we just learns just the facts , without even bothering about its concepts , meaning , then how can we develop idea ?secondly , nowdays , every work whether its business work , school work , or college work etc , everywork requires us to understand the concept of work , why is it to be completed , what is the advantage of such and so on .then only a person is capable of developing ideas and putting them in use .computer now have become the weapon for every work .where ever we see , we find people are operating on computer to carry loads of their work .one can not understand the facts of using such instrument , if he first does not understand the idea of such neither the concept of using that instrument will be clear .only educated . , well advanced in knowledge , whose all concepts are clear can continue working on the computer .thirdly , in business , a person should be kept in mind the idea of developing a business .a successful person is the only one who understands the idea and concept of building up the business .he has to keep up the records uptodate , transactions have to be regularly checked out , profits and the losses have to be viewed , and so on , after understanding all these concepts of business only , a person can set up his business well otherwise he have to bear losses .finally .students need to understand the idea of a concept , then only he can learn the facts for variety of topics in day to day life , not only in studies but must understand the importance oh their lives , as life teaches them to experience many things , and from there they should learn the ideas , because a person learns more from experiences . ..
