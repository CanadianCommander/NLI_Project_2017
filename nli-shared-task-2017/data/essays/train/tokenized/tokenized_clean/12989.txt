the meaning of being succesful can vary person to person .some people go on doing the things that they believe they are good at , while others prefer to try new things despite the risks that they need to take .i think a successful person is the one who likes trying new things and not being afraid of failing .a successful person should not be satisfied with what he or she has achieved .there can always be another areas to explore .i think it is very important for a person to be willing to improve his or her qualities by trying new things .by that way , this person can see what other areas she or he is talented and interested in .for me , a person is a successful one when she or he is open to new things and get the success at the end .doing what you have always done is not a good way to show your success .if somebody is good at some activity and has just this achievement , it does not mean very much to me .the real success can be observed when a person tries to be successful in a new project or an area .for example , i am good at swimming and i have had many awards from various competitions .but i also had an interest to play chess .i have taken course for it and i am now a successful chess player .with that success in new area , i see myself more successful and talented .a successful person should be able to transfer his or her success from one area to another .having confidence that you can be good at in different area and take risks is an indication of your motivation be successful and this is a characteristic that i believe a successful person should possess .in sum , i consider a person as a successful if that person gives importance to improve her or her qualities by trying new things , avoids from only doing the things she or he knows well and opens to the new experiences .moreover , i think a successful person should be good at transfering his or her ability to various situations .i also try to be a person having such characteristics and motivationg myself to trying new things and not to fear from taking risks .
