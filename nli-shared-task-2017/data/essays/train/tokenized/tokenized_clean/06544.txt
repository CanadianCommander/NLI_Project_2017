one of the most preferred way of transportation is using a car nowadays .people want to be free , do not want to depend on buses , trains and any other transportation choices , if they have the capability of enduring its cost .in twenty years there will be more cars on the ways than there are today for following reasons .first of all , people work harder and earn much more money by the improvements of the technology and they want to take benefits of this , so they prefer owning their private cars rather than using public transportation vehicles .even they buy cars for their childeren when they entered an university so in one home usually two or three cars are being used .although it can be thought that the sources of energy to move a car , the petrolium will be scarce , not available by the time passes and petrolium sources will finish , i believe more convenient ways will be popular in the near future such as solar energy or bor material will be used as a source of energy in the car s motor .nowadays we also see the signs of this new useges .also the cost of car will be reduced because the automobile companies will be trying to spread the car useges among the people , fighting against the government policies that are done to improve public transportation and make it more popular .so people will be able to choose and buy more suitable cars , which also have higher technology .in conclusion , in the near future , lets say in twenty years there will be more cars driven on the roads since both poeple will be earning more money and car factories will be offering cheaper and technologically more developed cars to them , and also new usege of energy sources such as solar energy or bor material will affect this proces in a positive way .
