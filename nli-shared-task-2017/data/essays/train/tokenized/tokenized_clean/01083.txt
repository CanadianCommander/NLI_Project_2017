i disagree with the statement which is `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in my opinion nobody can learn something just by knowing what the subject is about .they need to know what they do , what they mean , what they symbolise !to start with , how is it possible to learn something without knowing the facts ?just by understanding the ideas and concepts , you basically summerize the subject .if you call that more important than knowing the facts ; go head and good luck in life .if you do nt know what are the facts you wo nt be able to picture what is the real meaning of that subject .do you think that we would be this civilized and this technolized if we did nt use and learn the facts that has been done about a similar action that might be done in the history ?history is a great teacher itself .for example , many leaders have read about history but they read them carefully and fully .they didnt just read the summaries because if they did nt just want to know the main ideas .they also wanted to learn the facts .if you read them over and over again then you might be able to understand the mistakes that they did in the past , so you wo nt do them also .facts are always reliable , because you can not chance them after they have been done .all our lifes , we live by facts .if the facts were nt that important do you think that governments would have laws which punish you for some certain facts that you do ?when you are just a child , you fall and hurt yourself or burn yourself and so on , then you get the facts , the idea of whatever you do has a fact .in this world whatever a person does has a fact !it s just the way it is .we may not be able to chance it but ; it is for sure that we can try to learn from the facts from what we did .we are all humans and we all have to except the fact that we have a destiny and to be succesful in that line of destiny we have to look at the facts not just the ideas and the concepts so that we can be successful in life !
