many people can think that the more you go to school the more you will be able to understand the world .they think that going to university make you become an open-minded person .at the university you learn theory - ideas and concepts - but what will theory be useful for you if you have nt any practice - facts ?for example , i am a civil engineering student and at school i m learning science of structures or how calculate the rate of steel you have to put in concrete to make a good prestressed concrete ?the theory looks pretty good .however in fact when you are on a site work all that theory is not helpful .it s only the experience that will give you the good rate of steel .even if i think that understand the concept of prestressed concrete is very important , only the facts will show you how to be a good civil engineer .to illustrate , i will give my example .last summer i made a training course in a house building company .even if i had studied civil engineering for one year , i was unable to give order to plumbers or electricians or other handworkers because i did nt know in fact , in reality , on the site , how they can execute the plans .i think that concepts and facts must be taught together .you have to understand the concepts and to know to what they are related to in the real world .it s important to always be connected to the reality .an idea without its application can be misunderstanding .speaking of aids without speaking of the real dangers in all countries , without speaking of africa s problems could make a student think that it ca nt happen to him , that it is a rare disease , that he s not conerned .that is not acceptable .
