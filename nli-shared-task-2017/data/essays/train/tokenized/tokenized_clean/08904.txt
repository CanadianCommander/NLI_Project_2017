i disagree with this statement beacuse i can not imagine a world without cars .how will the people move to everywhere ? .every year the technology is getting better and the cars are maken much better .now there are highbrid cars and there are cars that do nt use petrol but the light of the sun .this means that the cars are becoming good for the enviorment .they do nt make so much diox of carbon like before .this is a big success .many people are using a lot of behiculs like a car to go to many places .we can go from door to door easily in short time than walking .actually , the average of using cars is growing up every day .so i think it will be very difficult for the people to leave their cars and start to walk or run for going somewhere .i think that in twenty years there will be more cars than now .in twenty years , the technics of making cars and the technology will be better , so there will be better cars than now .maybe in twenty years the cars could be flying on the air .or maybe all the cars will only use the brigth of the sun and do nt use any petrol more .i can not imagine a world without cars .how will the people move to everywhere ?
