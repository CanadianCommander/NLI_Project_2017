young people enjoy life more than older poeple do .although most young people in kuwait are always being controled by their parents they still have an amazing time being young .being young means feeling health and happy .older people have never ending worries .in a young person s life friends may always be the main factor .young people in kuwait live their lives to the fullest .they live happily always and do not care about the worries that come in their way .they always seem to have the right solution by using help from people they trust like a member of their family or a friend that is considered a sister or brother .they make their own lives and choose their own happiness for them to continue living happy and healthy .young people in kuwait are usually from ages 14 up to the age of 30 .that is the time when the girl or boy is neither married nor having large responsibilities in life .they depend on their parents in every matter .at this age its most likely to see youngsters always being with their friends and having fun in malls or in beach houses hanging out .they always can get stress out of their minds by geting together with people they love and feel comfortable with , while older people ca nt get stress away that easy .its really rare seeing young people with family at this time of age .being an old person such as a parent or even an old bachelor is hard .having many resposibilties to carry around and worry about is one of the reasons an old person would wish to be young .having children that are always on the parent s mind and especially a trouble maker is not what people could call enjoying life .also an old bachelor with many business or work to do can have a hard life .older people are not as happy as young ones , but they still can be happy .young people really do have a happy life but once they grow up they do wish to be young again .most youngsters are always happy and they do not carry around huge lumps of stress , except if that person likes to have stress on his/her mind , which is sometimes common .enjoying life as a kid makes it easier to hate life as an older person .
