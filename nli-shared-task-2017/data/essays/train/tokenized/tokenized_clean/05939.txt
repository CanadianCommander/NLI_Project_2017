in this set of material , according to the reading passage .i agree with the statement ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .in this competitive world one have to be able to fight or handle , the different kinds of situation that arises in becoming him a successful man or take him towards , glory or victory .one have to be very hard working and very fast and clevere to compete and to lead in the race of success .a succewssful man according to me is a person who takes risks rather than working or doing a single thing in which they already have knowledge and they have hope that they are the best in that field .according to my opinion a ` successful  man is a person who takes risks and lead the nation .people should take risks and try new things through which , they can succeed .many great people have taken risks for getting success in there work .for example , the egyptian people have made churches with great height which was not possible until the romans period .they took a risks and constructed the churches not only with a great height , but also took a risks and made the possibility of making windows in between the domes with the help of ` barrel vaults  .so , according to my opinion a person is not ` successful  until and unless he takes risks .he is able to learn more things or able to understand the different fields which he is not familiar about .taking risks , makes him think more this improves his ability to think and get closer to the things which he is not familiar about .one s he is succeded he gets a name and he becomes familiar .by taking risks his mind power for thinking increases and he able to decide and get to a good conclude that whether , he is able to achieve that goal or not .so , at last i conclude that one is not successful in his life until and unless he takes risks .
