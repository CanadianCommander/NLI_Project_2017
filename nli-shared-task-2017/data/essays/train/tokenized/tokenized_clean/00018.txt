i disagree this idea that young people nowadays do not help communities .i support this idea for specific reason .i wathed tv proglam last week , and that proglam is about volunteer activity .i saw many college students were doing volunteer on tv .the students support elderly people .these elderly people experienced world war 2 , and the students want to listen these elderly s talk about war they have never experienced before .by making good relationship with these elderly , the young people try to understand their sadness , and they try to find the meaning of peace .they said , `` we do nt know war , and we feel we are living in peaceful country , but there are still many wars around the world , and people killing , and dying more and more . .we think young people should learn from war-experienced people more than text book .i m also belong volunteer club which is teaching japanese to foreigners .many of them are kids , and they came japan because their parents came japan to find thier job .in japan , salary is much higher than developping country .of course they can not speak japanese , so their children can not keep up with japanese students .even more , they often teased and descriminated by their friends .they need help .abouv all , young people
