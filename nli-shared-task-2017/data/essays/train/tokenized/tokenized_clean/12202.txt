do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?this for sure is one of those questions that bring about so many discussions .when one is young , it is easier to speak , to reach strong judgments .when you are older , however , you get to have a different perspective on life -- not that i am one of the old yet , but turning 30 recently has made me see things in a different light .and no , i do not agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .of course , being young gives one an obvious advantage -- that of being physically fit and active .when one is young , they feel like they can do anything ; they have their whole lives to look forward to .they can try out new things , go see new places , meet new people , and so on .however , as pleasing as this may seem , such an abundance of choices also brings displeasure , unhappiness , and at times , even regrets .especially when combined with inexperience , one is likely to encounter -- and will , by all means -- many stones .you tend to make more mistakes and make decisions you later would like to forget .being old , on the other hand , is a whole different story .yes , it means that you will not be able to jump and run around as much as you would like , you will have to see the doctor a little more often than you used to , and you may have to cut out on certain flavors you are so used to have .however , this does not mean that one can not really enjoy oneself because they are old .age means experience , and this experience is what makes it easier to derive pleasure out of life .the more a person has seen of the world -- the pains and the pleasures , the easier it becomes for them to make the most of what they have .in conclusion , being old does not necessarily mean getting less out of life .on the contrary , it provides you with the opportunity to have more pleasure out of it , and what is more , be able to be grateful for the things you have .
