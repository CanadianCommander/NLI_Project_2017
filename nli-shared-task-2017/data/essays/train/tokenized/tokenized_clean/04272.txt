young and old people both enjoys life with their best they can do .young people have some problems too same as to for the older ones .but here i think that the young ones generally enjoy more that that of the old people .in my opinion , young thinks less about their future and the outcomes of their deeds .while in case of older people they generaly think about the outcomes of their misdeed so what they do is carefully as compared to young people .most of the old people generally lost their purpose of living and wait for the death , indeed , some enjoys their life , regardless of the worries at home .in joint families generally old people get the respect but when thing comes to the nuclear families , old ones are neglected .but it is not in the case of the young ones they are loved by the whole family members and most of their mistakes are neglected .this carries them to go on enjoying more .appearence the the next thing in the context .obviously , the old people have lost their charming faces , their well toned body and now they have lose skin with lots of raches and water is comong out of their mouth .they seems little ugly but young-ones are cute and lovable .this makes them to be loved by most of the people and get support to do things more and enjoy them .one of the most important thing old people generally sleep late night and wakeup early in the this distracts most of the people and me too .they wakeup and will do something , which generally disturbs others sleep and i love mornig sleep .and young people also enjoys it a lot .in this way i think that according to above based examples young people enjoys more than old people .
