nowadays , people are taught many things including their own special subject .i think because people have strong desires of knowing everythings and the social wants let them study various things .however i stongly disagree with this statement .because it is not only wasting time and but also it makes people get tired to study more about the subjest in which they specialize .let me give an example of my case .i specialized in classical music for bachelor course .during my college time , i had to take the lecture about not only music but also about social science lecture .the practice time was lacked during this period .because my lecture schedule finished every 6 oclock every weekdays .i think that the musician can create the art when they well practiced and took enough rest .however i had to spend a time to study about things what i do not really need for my music subject while i had to sit front of piano or go bed .in addition , i could waste not only time , but the energy in which i need to focus on my study wich i specialized .if i took too much time on studing other subjet that i think needless for pass the grade , i should easily get tired .moreover it makes to not be emphazised on my specialized works .in conculusion , if people keep concetrate on what they specialized , the world get peacefull and they will thank to each other for helping them about they do not know .
