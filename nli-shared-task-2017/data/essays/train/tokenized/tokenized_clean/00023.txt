i would rather agree with that statement .at the beginning i better define what i mean by saying `` young people  and `` old people  .young people are in the age of 15 to 30 and old people could be considered as older than 50 years .of course there is a gab in between , but like in most discussions there is not only a black and white scheme , but also a `` grey  in between .well , first of all , in my perception young people are simply more active than older people .this is truly a obvious argument , but why is that ?young people are more curious and less experienced .because of this they feel more demand to go out , discover , making new experiences .they are still more in a process of personal development than older people are .speed is a signifacant reference for that .an example - young people fell in love more often and probably have more relationships than people have in older days .they discover much more streams of the `` zeitgeist  , which means they develop new forms of expression like new music styles , fashion , computer gaming and new kinds of behaviour like flashmobbing or exchange via internet .despite the fact that young people have less money to spend than older people , they are trying out new ways of travelling and doing party .older people are in general less open to new developments .they are often not able to keep up with all new streams and developments in society .they are embedded in their normal day situation which often only consists of business and family .their social activities and sport activies more or less follow the same patterns .of course it is possible to older people to enjoy their lifes too , but they often wait too long until starting with that .in their older days they are often handicaped and unable to to what they always wanted to to , to go out and feel young again .this might be quite frustrating .to sum up i would clearly argue that young people are doing much more activity than older people .and they are less defined by their jobs , a family , a duty or handicaped by their physical abilities .
