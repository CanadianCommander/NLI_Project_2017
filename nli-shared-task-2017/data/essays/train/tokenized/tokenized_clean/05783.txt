first of all i do not agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy their life more than older peolple .i think that the way to enjoy life is different but this not imply what the statement says .today young people can enjoy in several ways , respect one or two generations ago because is permited almost everything : for example have the car very early , to go out every weekend and spend a lot of money to take drinks and to go to the disco with some friends .they can also enjoy themself organizing some party between compains of school or university .a friend of mine told me that he went to danmark as erasmus student and he descibed me that experience as a beautiful thing .every day he enjoyed his life going to erasmus party that took place almost every evening in the university place .he told me also that the mainly enjoy it was the beer and the disco .in stead , the fact that the older persons do not do the same things it does not mean that they enjoy less : they have only other interestes .the major part of older persons are married and for this reason the prefer enjoy their free time going , for example , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaurant for a romantic dinner .of course many older people could have son or daughter and this imply that they do not have the same time respect the young people , to spend for enjoy themself .the have to do a lot of thing into house and at the work .
