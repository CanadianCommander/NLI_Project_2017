i completely agree with the proposed statement .in my opinion , there are sound reasons to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .first , i think that pollution has become a serious global problem that soon will have to be solved .in addition , i believe that unaffordable oil prices will incentivate people to use other kind of transportation .first of all , we may argue that nowadays almost everybody supports a dramatical reduction of pollution .we all can agree that cars contribute to increase urban pollution .in order to tackel this problem , some cities , such as london , have implemented new regulations that do not allow people to drive cars around the center of the city .from what i see , much more cities should apply this sort of policies .likewise , many cities are currently improving the services rendered by their public transportation in order to provide people with a good alternative to the car .i think that these two measures will incentivate people to avoid using the car ; thus , we may conclude that fewer cars will be in use .secondly , i consider that soaring oil prices will also help to have fewer cars in use .from my point of view , oil has already started to be a really scarce good , and even now many people have problems to pay for it .hopefully , people will realize that using the car is not sustainable from both an ecological and an economic standpoint .to sum it up , i do believe that in twenty years we will see fewer cars running through the streets .we may expect that people will colaborate to reduce pollution and will start using public transportation .in addition , i think that oil prices will prevent people from using the car or , at least , will incetivate people to use it less .
