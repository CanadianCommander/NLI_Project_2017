most people consider that young people enjoy like more than older people do .but i disagree with this idea from the reasons below .firstly , older people know what is their interesting from their long experiences .when poeople are still young they are in the time to seek what they are really interested in .on the contrary , oler people have already know because they probably have found their hobby , additionally they know enoughly how to enjoy them .for example , to enjoy carigraphy deeply , it needs to much time to be familliar with it .secondly , older people have money that younger people .in any countries , people earn plenty of money from their long laboring to sepnd their retired time without working .for example , in japan , many company aim at seniors and produce many goods and plans for older people s hobbuy such as carigraphy , computer games , shogi | japanese chess ] .therefore , being different from their younger age when they earn to feed their child and let them enroll schools , they can use money for their own because they do not have duty to raise children .thirdly , older people have enough time to spend doing what they like .recently , in japan , many older people enroll into some communities to enjoy with other seniors .although younger people do not have enough time because they have to work to live or feed their children all day long .from these reasons , i disagree with the idea to consider that youn people enjoy life more than older people do .
