i disagree with this statement .i am only a high school student so i m not really sure about how elderly feel .but i ll state three reasons which i m sure about it .they are ; we are all same human beings , generation really does nt matter , all people feel joy at differnt time .first reason why i disagree is because , we are all same human beings .it s true that elderly as our grandparents had lived in a difficult time such as the world wars .eventhough i believe that they also had an enjoyable young age .for me , everything was fun when i was a little girl .watching at a line of ants were even enjoyable .therefor i m not sure how our thoughts will change through when we get older but , i m still sure that we wo nt forget presious memories .second reason is because , looking at my grandmother makes me feel the age does nt matter to enjoy the events .she likes to go watching movies with friends and after coming back she always talks to me how the movies were and what she did with her friends , with twinkling eyes .from these experiences i m sure that she is enjoying her life as an elderly .last reason is because , i think that all people has different thoughts and feelings of the word enjoyment .i feel most of the things which i felt happy enjoyable .even on the train watching other people sometimes mkes me enjoyable .talking with friends , family and eldarly who i just met in the street is also enjoyable time for me .as a result i think feeling their life enjoyable or not does nt depend on the generation .it will be different by how people think the events on their usual life .
