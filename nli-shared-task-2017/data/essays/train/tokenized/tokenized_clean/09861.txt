i personally do not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take the risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well .in fact i think that is not a matter of being successful that pushes people to try new things and to take the risks .actually successful people are very much concerned about their knoweldge and probably are not likely to risk because they do not want to loose their popularity .for examples a brillant manager knows exactly what his  her skills are and therefore he  she would never try to do something new because of uncertain and risk that can lead to their replacement by someonelse who is better than he  she is in that particular issue .it seems strange that someone who is already successful and knows how to do something well does nt want to try or does nt take the risk .normaly these kind of people should have a strong character and therefore the wright spirit to challenge themselves in new things .but the surprising thing is that they are the one who have hard time realizing that they are valid persons and that if they have achieved certain success is because they have the qualities required .i think that these type of persons , unfortunately , have a big lack in their personality .in fact they seem not to be self confident even if they would not revelate to the pubblic .furthermore i belive that people who are not successful are more willing to try new things and to risk .first of all because they have nothing to loose and second because in this manner they will have a chance to show their capabilities and to create a stronger character by challenging themselves .
