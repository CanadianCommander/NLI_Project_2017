some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but some of the others prefer to travel alone or with a couple of partners .in my opinion , i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are three reasons based on my experience convince me that the best way to travel is alone or with partners .first of all , self-organized travels maintains personal preferences on routes .it would be dipressed that some places one wishes to visit are not on the tour list .to travel alone hat the benefit of choosing whatever one likes and whereever one wants to go .for me , traveling is a self discovering adventure .without the freedom to make decisions during the travel is lack of the meanings of traveling its own .secondly , i prefer to organize a tour on ones own because one would learn more and get the most of the period of time .from collecting informations of the destination and researching the cultural differences , one abtaines so much more knowledge along with the planning .furthermore , planning the schedule would help one to get the basic knowledge of the trip .on the contrary , in a group led by a tour guide limits the possibility to explore interresting facts of different cultures and also limits people s incentives to get more to know about the backgroud of the place .thirdly , the flexible schedule makes travels more enjoyable .everyone who had followed a tour trip had had such experience of rushing to follow the schedule .self-organized travel is flexible that one can make decisions based on the weather , health conditions , or even mood .for example , if one gets too tired from yesterdays schedule , one can just sleep more until the the energy gets back .flexible schedule not only adjust the personal condition better , but also brings out unexpected surprises during the trip , which is one the most wonderful part of traveling .for example , five minute late for the bus might lead one to another route , but the other way which less traveled by might be more beautiful than the original plan .in conclusion , there are so much more fun to travel alone or with a couple of partners rather than following the fixed schedules .in my opinion , the most momorial moments in a travel are those which i did not expect .
