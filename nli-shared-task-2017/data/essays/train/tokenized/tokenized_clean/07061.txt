most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .that is true .that is the way how to sell their products , because people always want to buy better product .and the advertisements know it , so make the products look better to sell it .first , the advertisements have to sell their products , so they try to explain about their products .then they do not want to tell disadvantages about their products , they just want to tell advantages of it .in the process , they sometimes have to cover the disadvantages .so they tell other people about their products overly good .and other people believe what they say , and think about what they heard .the people will think that product is really good because they did not hear about its disadvantages .a good looking is tasting good .as for products , it is really important how they are looking .if they look good , then they seems work better or taste better than how they are .so when people make the products , they make them looking better for cover custumer s eyes .and other people would believe that the products are better than they really are because they are looking good , believing looking good is better than looking bad .these days , people care so much about the products  out-looking .for example , there are many different types of vecumm machines .they look all different .and there is a best working one which suck things really well and there is a best looking one which looks strong and fancy , then the best seller would probably be the looking fancy and strong one than really working good one .most products seem much better than they really are because that s how they have made for .it is a hope for productors and advertisements for selling them better .
