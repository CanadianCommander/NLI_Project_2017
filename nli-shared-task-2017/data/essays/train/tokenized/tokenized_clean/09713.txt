i agree with the statement porpoused in wich is stablished that for students it is more important to undertand ideas and concepts than learning facts .i do have to be clear saying that facts are not as important as concepts and ideas are , but fatcs are not secundary thing without impotance they are really importat in any learning process .i say this because i am student and i can now be sure that when a teacher begins explaining facts without a theory before that includes different concepts and ideas , the class is really a lack of time , because students maybe understand the facts but do not really learn the theory that it is behind of it .althouht it is also inconvinient for learning , when whe as students only recive concepts and ideas but no facts or examples that explains what the teacher is trying to explain , because in this way possibly we learn a teory but we wo nt be capables of ussing it .a clear example of this matter it is when you try by yourself to read a law , for sure will be very difficult to understand what is regulating , but when a teacher gives you some facts it is much clear and you really understand what is that law trying to regulate .finally i do have to accept that when a teacher uses facts that really ecourage students .so i think i is clrear that concepts are very important but thet sholud be accompai
