honestly , i believe that it is a better to be a virtuoso in a particular field rather than being a dilletante .a person who tends to grope at everything at once , ultimately ends up with empty hands .to cite an example , i would like to take up the case of doctors .how preposterous would it be to have a doctor repairing your dentures and at the same time trying to perform a cardiac surgery on you .i for one would definitely not want to be at the mercy of such a person .the new age world demands specialization .it makes more sense to perfect a task , rather than to jump from one thing to another .in todays world professionals are in great demand .as the title suggests , one expects a person to be professionally involved in a field and not just pursue in as a hobby .i would not like to go to far to adduce another example .my grandfather , who happens to be an undergraduate in liberal arts , post graduate in marketing , and a diploma holder from iift chose to enter an industry as alien as the shoe industry .quite predictably he could not get a firm foothold in the industry and within a year , he switched over to an equally absurd field , construction .my grandfather who was not even close to being an engineer wallowed meaninglessly in an arena which tacitly required a minimum of 4 years of engineering .quite understandably he could not survive in the cut throat competition among the architectural fraternity .i regret saying it but he now sits idle at home , next to a dying hearth with his numerous degrees lying straggled around him .he still has 4 years till retirement but unfortunately not a company to approach .in todays world , competition requires you to be an ace at whatever you do .the kind of in-depth experience specialization lends to a person can not be achieved by merely scraping the surface of a particular subject .to sum it all up , if one lays waste his powers in trying to dabble at anything and everything , he merely ends up being a jack of all trades for who this world , blessed with specialists in their own fields , has no room .
