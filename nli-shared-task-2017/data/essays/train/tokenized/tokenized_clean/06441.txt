i agree this point that it is more important for students to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .because understanding concepts make them to deal with the problems which are occured with that particular concept .let us take one example by learning the concept of computers we may able to use it in an efficient way .we are also able to deal the probles found with it .only the person who knows about the computers can only deal with it .by knowing the concepts we are able to have good ideas about developing that concept .and we can creat a new concept .we are well experienced by knowing the conceptconcept undertanding makes us to have more command and control over a concept than learning facts .we do not get experienced by learning facts .we only know about the thing and working about it .but knowing the concept we know the process of it and internal structure of it .by understanding the concept we can even try to work with the other fields for example .if a person knows about the programming language ` c  he can also try to work with ` java  because some syntax are same in both of the languages .we cannnot have an idea by learning facts .they remain unchanged even after the many years .we may have new ideas by understanding concepts .we also become experts in taht particular field .by understanding the concept there is no scope of forgetting it .so i suggest students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
