in order to understand something globaly , we should learn facts as well as understand ideas and concepts .however , sometimes understanding is better than learning , or in some cases it is the contrary .it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because this will help them to memorise the facts and understand other isuues related to the subject they are studying .for example , when a student fully understands a mathematical theory , he or she will be able to resolve many related mathematical problems easier .for some students , it is much easier to understand ideas than to learn facts by heart .others , on the other hand , prefer to memorise facts rather than trying to understand concepts .in my opinion , there is no general rule stating what is more important for students .it depends on the class the students are taking , wether it is more important to understand concepts or to learn facts .in history class for example , learning about events and facts is more important than understanding them , it is even impossible to understand some issues in history .whereas in a computer , physic or a biology class for example , students are asked mainly to understand theories and concepts , they should be able to analyse data and give solutions and results making use of what they understood .so , there are some classes that requier more learning than understanding , and other classes that requier more understanding than learning .
