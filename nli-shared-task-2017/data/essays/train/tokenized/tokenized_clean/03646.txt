a lot of people belive that it is more important for students to learn fact .however , i agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .here are some seficific reason to support my opinion .first of all , if people just learn fact they would think just result and they would care about only fact besides any processing .when i was in high school i was that kind of person who just care about result and fact and i just studied and memorize a lot of things .it seemed worked couple of times .i got good grade until i was in freshman but i got really bad score in history class .i was upset because i thought i knew pretty well about history so i complained to history teacher .at that time , my teacher said that i logically remember everything for example if she asked `` which year did it happen ?i could answer but if she asked `` which happened below that happend ?i could not answer .that is because i just remembered the fact i did not care about why i happended .after that i changed a style of way to study and tried to understand concepts and ideas not only fact and i got higher score in history class and even other classes too .second of all , if students just studyed fact it would also not good for their patient .they would learn what is the begining and result .thesedays lots of people can not be patient they can not wait only a few minute .in conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
