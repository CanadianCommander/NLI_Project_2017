i agree with this statement , i think indeed that in general successful poeple are more likely enklined to get into new and maybe more risky situations ( financially or personaly )when poeple have reached a honorable level of social success , they tempt to be much more self confident and by that less subject to being afraid of taking risks .most of the time the risks are taken financialy .but those are nt most of the time uncalculated ; they are done in a way that they will not be totaly in danger .for example : if it s a financial risk , they will probably mesure the level of danger in so far that even if it takes a negative turn , they will be able to handle it .
