ther are some people who belive that in the future it will be fewer cars in use that today .they usually argue that in twenty years we will discover another type of public transport that could remplace the tradicional cars .i not agree with this optimistic vision .in fact , i think that in twenty years it will be double of cars that there are in use today .i think this because three main reasons .actually use of the car is not extended in africa , india or even in china , but when the wealth of these countries grows up , the citizens are going to demmand more cars .in a few years they will be at the same level as europe and usa , and please note that in europe and usa we have an averadge of two cars per familly ,therefore there is another important argument : the petrolium and gas .the future of gas industry depends of the number of cars , so they are not going to allow that the number of cars decrease .therefore , there is no chance that we discover a new energy fount in only twenty years .the last argue is the cars industry .it is a powerfull industry , which provides work for thousand of people arround the world .the goverments are going to use its influence to increase the number of cars in order to avoid social problems in their countries .it will be great if we could reduce the use of cars , specially because it would helped us to decrease the pollution on the earth .but i afraid that it is only a dream ; the reality used to be more cruel .
