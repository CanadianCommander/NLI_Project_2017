many people belive than younger generation are different from the older one and they dos nt posses the same morals and manners as the elders have .or they may be less responsible or less cooperative with other members of society .i do nt know from where this idea came from .i belive that every generatin has a bright side and a dark one .it is not fair to generalize an idea wether is bad or good over large number group of population , becuase simply we not the same .i believe that people are differnet and vary from person to another regardless the age or the time or the place they belong to .each generation has its own life conditions and atmosphere that could have a great impact on people behavior , like weather , finacial status , education , civelization , cultural development , believes and society customs .what works with one generation doe nt mean that it works with another .i do nt see any valuable mean of that statment .there are still mush of goodness in people , people stil tell this time helping each other , providing services to commmunity without asking for rewards .there are many feeding poor hunger people on the other side of the world .the are some still have th working volenteerly with human organization to save others and to give hand who really need help .me my self with other school collegues participate in a volenteer job in red crecent organization in palestine .we were working as a medical laboratory technologists in a very poor pemetive laboratory at the hospiatal .we had worked as a team to help poor and severly injured patients in any pssible way we got to help them .we were collecting samples from them try to diagnose their health problem to make them feel soon healthier .
