comparison of understanding and learning is probably one of the most important discussions i have seen about the turkish educational system in the last ten years .this paper will mainly discuss the positive and negative sides of understanding the ideas and concepts and learning the facts .understanding the ideas and concepts for students is very important for not only for their education life but also the real life .as an illustration , a phylosophy teacher may explain plato as only a man who said that there has to be three groups to form the ideal society : workers , soldiers and the leaders .it would not mean anything to the student .because of this statement , the student may think that my father is working as a doctor , my uncle is a soldier and i am seeing the president of my country once a week so my country is just like plato explained centries ago .contrarily , the same philosophy teacher may explain that the three groups forming the society are the mirror images of the three qualities which form the good person .these qualities are desire symbolized by workers , emotions symbolized by soldiers and virtue symbolized by the leaders .understanding the concepts behind plato s ideas are more important than the plato s ideas themselves .on the other hand , learning the facts are also very important for scince and engineering students .with the help of the facts , people can understand the universe .by knowing the law of gravity , we can understand why an object can fall from the sky or by knowing kepler s law , we can understand how earth revolves around the sun .a student does not have to know the the number zero is discover , solving the question is more important for him/her .to sum up , i want to say that understanding ideas and concepts and learning the facts are very both very important for the students .on the other hand , i believe that understanding the ideas and facts make you a better person in addition to being a good student while learning the facts can make you only a good student .so , i agree with the statement that understanding is more important than learning .
