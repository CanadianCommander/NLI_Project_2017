we call older people for people who are arriving to the end of their life .in fact , this would not make them happy because this means the remaining time and memory they ve got is short .however , it makes them to figure out how the time and every events are so precious and valuable to them .therefore , they would try to enjoy thier life more than young people .and they will do it .these days , in asian regions , many high school students commit suicide , particually in korea and japan .usually , most of them get accumulated stress from school work , their grade and accepting to university although graduating and going to famous and prestigious university is not the full of life .as a student who used to study in korea , korean studetns do not have much free time to enjoy in high school life , because they re forced to study from teacher and family .i was also one of them .their life is repeteation of studying and learning .the only reason they work and study so hard is in order to go to university .in other words , there is no hope and happiness to live life to them .i believe there might be some exceptions but most of them are just like that .furthermore , young people ( teenagers ) desire to be an adault as soon as possible because there are a lot of exhibitions that they can not do such as smoking and marraiage .they just spend their time without doing anything .on the other hand , most older people realize the importance of time , and they try to make good meomory and spend great time with their family .the reason is basically because they do nt have enough time to enjoy their life .for example , if somebody informs to you that you have only one week to live and you die .then , you will try to do your best in everyseconds and would try to enjoy your remaing time .in fact , young people do not realize the importance of time every events and memory , because they are young .it also includes me .however , our reaction and action to live our own life would be changed once we figure out how the time is invaluable to you .
