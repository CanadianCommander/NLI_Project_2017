in general i agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take more risks instead of only do what they are used to do .there are several reasons why i do agree .in the first place , if you always do the same there is no development at all and your environment remains stable .it becomes boring and you do not differ from all the other people worldwide .success occurs when you do something surprising and new .one good example is columbus , who found america by doing something all the other men in his time hesitated .another example is the discovery of antibiotica , which was made by accident and trying something new .success means to differ from what is normal and familiar to the people .they want to be impressed and buy things that are new and in facion , so as a designer you also have to be creative and try new things .on the stock market you even have to take enormous risks if you want to make the highest income .here taking risk is fundamental .second , this is also true in the human partnerships .here you have to take high risk to talk to the person you like and say this to him or her , but only then you can be successful by coming together and get friens or even partners .you have to take the risk and see if you fail or succeed .without revealing your feelings to the other person you never know , if you would have been successful if you did .success also means improvement and this needs changes and developments .but these can only take place if you take risks and try new things .finally this statement is also true for me myself .i have chosen to take the risk and go in a foreign country to study and do my llm instead of staying at home and complete the normal education way that lawyers have in my home country .this includes being in a new surrounding and far away from home , but it is a challenge and it perhaps leads me to a more successful career than without taking this risk to study in a foreign country .in conclusion , all these points support the idea of the statement and therefore i agree with it .
