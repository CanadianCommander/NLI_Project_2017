enjoyment is not age or time bounded .its way of living joyfully , giving our best effort to life and extract whatever possible we can draw from life to make everyone around us happy .in different age everyone has his own way to enjoy life , so i disagree with topic that young people enjoy life more than old people do how we define enjoyment , for young people riding bike at high speed , late night parties , rock climbing and other adventur sports , movies , drinks can be way to enjoy life , on other extreme of life basking at the beach , holding hand oh life partener and walking on send , memmorising the old days with photo albums can be way to enjoy life .the ways used by young people to enjoy life can be abhor by old people , and the path adopted by old people to enjoy life can be dull and monotonus for young guys .a young guy may enjoy to see a person sliped on wet ground , a old person may enjoy giving hand to guy on fell the road .enjoyment of young people are mostly extravagent show , full of materialism , lewdfullness , levish parties that all show the adrenaline running in their vessels , it also lighten the impatince bound with the age concern , on other side enjoyment of geriatric person solemnly starts and and in spiritualism .so i conclude my words by saying that both extreme of life has there own way to enjoy the life and that cant be compare with the age .
