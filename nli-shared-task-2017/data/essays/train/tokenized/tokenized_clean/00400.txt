for considering people s opinions about usage of cars in the future , we have a variety of points of view to analyze .although some people think that there will be much cars in use than now in the future , i am certain that there will be fewer cars in use than present time in the future .there are several compelling reasons for my position .first , the situation of pollution is getting worse than use to be .in fact , human activities keep in harmming this planet day after day .however , there is a good news that people around the world start to care about this serious issue , and start to try to reduse the damage from people daily activities .for example , in the city i live in , start to pursause the residents to decrease the frequency of using their cars because the way can help to improve the quality of the air in this city .thus , this example shows that there is a movement that people have started to note that cars brings a lot of damage to our environment .second , in the most modern countries , the public transportation become more popular than before .in order to solve the growth of population and the number of citizen , many countries build up their public transportation system .take taipei , for example .recently , the gover of this city has a topic that is `` in taipei , without my cars .this activity want to encourage people stop driving their cars into town because there is no need .public transprotation system become more convenient that before .in addition , using this system also help people save a lot of time on finding parking space in town .thus , i think there will be fewer cars in use in the future by this trane .some people may think that driving thier cars is more convenient than taking other transportation .however , we are mebers of this world , and we all have duty to protect our living environment by reducing pollution we made .finally , for those reasons i have presents above , i think there will be fewer cars in use in the future .
