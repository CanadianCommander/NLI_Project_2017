in this essay , i will alternatively consider the pros and cons of travelling in a group lead by a tour guide , and of travelling alone , independently .i will come to the conclusion that it is both more gratifying and more profitable to travel by your own .i will illustrate my point of view with the experience i have of travelling alone in brazil .one can think that having one s trip organized by a tour guide offers many advantages .when one visits a foreign country whose language and culture one completely ignores , being led by a professional , and being part of a group of tourists , can make one feel more secure .for instance , the guide will help the tourists interact with the local population , playing the role of an interpret .he will also lead the tourists in places he will have chosen for their cultural value and their safety .unfortunately , these very advantages are likely to impoverish one s trip .firstly , the journey being both controled by the guide , and dependent on the dynamics of the group , one will not have an occasion to adapt the trip to his own interests .and as one will rely on the services of the guide , one will mostly remain passive .on the other hand , travelling alone might seem to be more dangerous , or at least more uncertain .no one will take care of you , no one ( except maybe guide books ) will tell you where to go and who to talk to during you travel .but the freedom you will gain will allow you to make your trip exactly what you want it to be .and since you will have to organize yourself , since will have to face and solve unexpected problems , you will gain a lot of experience .my trip to brazil taught me that .last year i left france , all by myself , to spend several months in brazil .there , i had to do everything by myself .i had to find a job to earn money , i had to look for accomodation , i had to meet people with whom i had no previous contact , and make new friends .and i had to decide what it was that i wanted to do there , where to go , what kind of life to live .all of this was a real challenge , but i learned a lot from it .really , i think that travelling alone is more positive
