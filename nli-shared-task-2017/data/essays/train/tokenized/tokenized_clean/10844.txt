i do nt agree with this statement .cars have an important place in our life .i m almost sure we ca nt think of leaving our cars at home and go to work by bus or simply walking , if we know that we have the possibility to do it by driving our car .we trust cars , the majority of us believe that cars have been the best invention of ever and that anything will ever substitute them .if nowadays cars are so important , thinking of the next twenty years i m sure that they will gain importance instead of losing it .if a family is composed of four people , we will have as many cars as the number of people having a driving license .this means that if each of them can drive , we will have four cars .a possible explanation is related to our need to have our own car .cars help us to feel indipendent .we can leave and we can come back whenever we want and the only thing we need to do is to drive .however , car means pollution .there have been a lot of promotions thaht have tried to prevent us from using our cars but they have failed .everyone of us know cars damage the environement because of the toxic gas they produce .sometimes , when something reminds us of it , we even think about catching a bus or going for a walk but we never do it .car is comfortable , it can take us everywhere and we ca nt stop from using it .the only possibility we have to leave our cars at home is to find a faster , cheaper and more comfortable way to travel .if we find a valid substitute for the car , perhaps in the next twenty yars there will be less cars than today .however , i  sure that nothing will ever been as perfect as the car .
