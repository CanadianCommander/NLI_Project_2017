i strongly disagree with the statement that young people are not having time to help their communities .we can see many concerts coming up that are managed or coducted by young people for a great cause like below .they strive hard to help by rasing funds .for example , take our community we have all together three clubs for helping them ; home for the aged , home for the blind , and orphanage .these clubs are found by all young people with the help of local authorities around our community .firstly , home for the aged was found in may 21 , 2003 .in this we have 34 club members who not only help the activies of daily living for the aged , but also work partime to help them financially .they also help them by giving moral support which they are not getting for their children by listening to their agony .secondly , home for the blind was found in december 1 , 2004 .this is a very talented club filled with teachers and musicians .in this club , we have all together 25 members who help them in many ways .they teach the blind how to read their notes and help them in palying musical instruments .they not only help them educating but make them feel the nature by explaning through their eyes .thirdly , home for orphans .this is also a very smart and talented club .it has around 18 members .these people go on streets and search for orphans who are child labors , sleep on pavements , railways , bus stands , etc .they help them to get admitted in some school by recommedations for the local authorities .they not onlyh do this they educate by helping them in their homeworks .in our community , we are going to start a new foundation soon .they do not do this as a pass time or pleasure .they do with real concern .if they are not concerned about this , i do not think there is a need for them to do part time jobs , conducting concerts , take help from the local leaders to get charity , etc .this example shows how young people are spending their time to help the society and spreading awarness to others .
