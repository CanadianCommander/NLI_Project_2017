the concept of success due to risk taking or not is hard to explain , and it is also a controversial one .on the one hand , taking risks is something very exciting but dangerous at the same time .on the other hand , keeping his/her knowledges and never taking others is more comfortable , but all the same dangerous too .but in my opinion , i think that the key of any succes is to take some risks .first of all , taking risks in all fields of life make the person more stronger in his/her mind , even if they can be dangerous .but you have to be enough intelligent to check your ability to know if one risk is very dangerous or not .for example , when you know that when you will do this or that it can be a threat for you , as you can lost your money , you do not take it .but in another way , the risk does an attractive thing to you that you want to try .that is the vicious feature of the risk that can lost you .secondly , i think that if anybody would have taken risks , our society would not be so effective !for instance , the hardest part of the companies created here were created by people who have taken risks . ..and if someone never takes just one time a risk in his/her life , probably he/she has gone next to marvellous things .finally , my device is to try something even if you are not sure of the result .and if you are really motivated , you will gain what you want and accede to success .there is no failure when taking good risks , that is to say risks that can not destruct your life .but he most important thing is to be able to know the limits .in a nutshell , someome who never takes risks is someone too angry and who will never win a real success .to sum up all the things , taking risks is something very important in anybody s life and overall , it can make the people to dream about things that they could realize one day , and to look for the future .
