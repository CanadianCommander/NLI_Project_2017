i both agree and disagree to this statement .first of all , i believe that a person who lives in an academic environment should have a broad knowledge on a number of subjects .because the solutions to todays problems require a broad knowledge from various areas of science .and those areas are usually interrelated to each other .whilst trying to find a relevant solution to an issue , a person could face many problems from a different area of science .so , the person should at least be familiar with the most basic principles of the related areas .i also believe , people with a broad knowledge on various subjects can easily understand the problem , find out the relevant options to solve it , and refer to the right fellow academics to get the right answers .if one does not have a broad knowledge , he/she can not find the way out of the difficulty he/she may face .on the other hand , the in depth specialization in a subject is a must in todays academic studies in order to be able to get to the right solutions of the problems in a particular subject .todays scientific problems require so good and in depth knowledge that one should be a subject matter expert to conduct relevant procedures in order to get relevant solutions .who would think , without the special knowledge in the subject one could be successful ?
