most of the people that had succed in such a great way in life usually go thruogh a long and a risk progress to get to where they are now .who said life what s supposed to be easy ?the reality is that is not and a lot people do nt want to face reality .some people just wish everything would just fall right in their hands , but that is not the point in life , we are here for a reason , we have hands for a reason , and that is to make a good use of them .sometimes people do nt realized all they can do and they get satiesfied with one thing that they know they re good at .taking risks is not always safe , but it can take someone to a higher level .in the united states there are so many opportuties and so many ways you can explore things in life that will help you to become someone in life .in third world countries like africa and latinoamerica people have to face a lot of challenges everyday in life , because there are not many opportunities in their countries they take dangerus risks such as leaving their countries .a great example of it are the many ilgegal immigrants latinoamericano that the united states has , because of the difficulties that people have getting a job and trying to provide for their families , they immigrate to countries like the u.s. to try to see their dream come true in life and to make a difference .many of this people have reach their goal but there are others that have nt , because that s just how life is but they still try and that marks something in their path .in life you have to be willing to do a lot of things around you that not may always look easy but at the end the results are worthy , and you can just look back and apreciate what you ve done
