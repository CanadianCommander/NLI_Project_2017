although being polyvalent is a good thing because you are able to discuss about everything , being specialized in one specific subject is more valuable to me .indeed , in my opinion , when you are able to be the best in one specific subject it means that you can focus very hard on something in a way to do your best .that s the most important .people who have a little knowledge of a lot of things are common persons .being specialized in one topic is very important because it s a way to make yourself different .being good at ease on several subjects is common nowadays .you are not efficient when you are know a little of severals topic because your mind is not focus on something that you can do , or explain better than everything .even if you have an important knowledge of several topics , you are not able to be as good , in your argument , as someone who is very good in one subject .furthermore , being very good in one subject means being weak in other topics .because you spend most of your time in studying ( or working ) the same thing , you do nt open your mind to other things , or do nt even being interested in doing something else because you know that you wo nt be able to be as good as you are in your specialisation .anyway , if your are able to focus yourself to only one thing , it means that you can focus on anything .being well focus on something is one of the most important thing nowadays : in work , studies . .anything .to me , you are more efficient when you are able to forget everything around you except the thing you are doing .as an example let s take the car .if you are focus when you are driving , if you are not changing the radio or dialling a number on your cellphone , nothing can happen even if a other car arrives very fast from anywhere .because being focus on something means control it .
