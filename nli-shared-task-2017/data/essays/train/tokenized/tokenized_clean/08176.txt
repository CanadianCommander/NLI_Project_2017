trying new things and taking risks is a critical part of progress .it is the essence of creation , without which we would have never progressed beyond the stone ages .it is important for people to grow , learn from mistakes and bring about changes .and it is a must for successful people in most professions in today s business world .people who only do what they already know how to do well do not grow personally .they do nt get to realize their full potential .they do a mediocre job at what they are doing , because they do not contribute anything new , only what they have been doing for years or what everyone else has been doing .on the other hand , people who try something new or take risks stand out from the crowd .people respect them for their courage and self-confidence .if the risk brings success along with it , then it is most often phenomenal success .because risk-taking usually results in all-or-nothing type scenarios .but even if the risk does nt bring about success , it is certainly a means for the person to learn something , and will pave the way for success in the future .there are some professions where it is not only preferable that people try new things and take risks , but it is obligatory .for instance , in advertising , it is extremely important to come up with something new for your advertising campaign .if you do nt do something out of the ordinary , then your advertising campaign will blend in with the other millions of advertising campaigns out there and will not even be remembered by your target audience .trying new things and taking risks is part of what makes us human , of our creative spirit .we should not restrict our creative spirit for fear of failure , for failure is also a part of the learning process .and it is what bring success in the long-term .
