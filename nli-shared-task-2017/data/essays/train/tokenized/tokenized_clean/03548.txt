i agree with what the article says .some people think understand ideas and concepts is important for students , and some people think lern facts is important for students .however , from the fact of national survey and my own experience , i think understand ideas and concepts is more important for students .first off , i agree with the article because national survey says some countries which teach ideas and concepts to students in math , and history class usually have ranked in high educated countries in the wold .according to the article , in some countries , such as greenland and honkong , which teach students ideas and concepts , adults usually have great insight and memory about what they studied when they were in high schools .however , some countries , which tend to teach student just fact , adults usually do nt remember what they studied when they were in high schools .second , i agree with what the article says because if people study just facts , they ca nt apply what they studied in daily life .people are studyng to make them knowledgble .since , i m from japan , i had an experience to support my opinion .when i `` m taking a math class in hong kong , people usually asked me many question about math .even though , i was really good on my math , i could nt answer futher questions of them and they considered i m cheating .in conclusion .i agree with what the article says because of these reasons .
