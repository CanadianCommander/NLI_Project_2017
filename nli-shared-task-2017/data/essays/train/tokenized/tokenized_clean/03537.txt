in the past few years we humans have made great advancements .with the increase in adcancements , there is so much more to know and learn .so much is happening every minute .it is very difficult to keep tab on each and everything happening in the world .thus when i am faced with the question as to ` whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?  , i would always choose to specialize in one specific subject .i beleive that if one is specialized in one particular subject then he is better off in this ever so competitive world than a person who has broad knowledge on many areas , but lacks specialization in one .life has become so competitive .in today s scenario only the best can survive .even the highly qualified people are finding it difficlut to find a proper job .having specialized in a particular subject helps give direction to ones life .being specialized , one can really prosper in that subject area and do well for himself and his family .but on the other hand , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , are not particularly knowledgeable in one particular area .thus it is difficult for these people to find a good stable job .today most firms , businesses and agencies prefer specialized individuals who can handfle difficult and trying situations .i am not trying to argue that people should not have any knowledge about other academic subjects .i am a strong beleiver in the fact one should have some information of whats going on around him .but accumulating broad knowledge on many subject areas is not possible if one decides to specialize in one subject .many argue that if once a person has obtained specialization in a particular subject then he can still go ahead and obtain broad knwoledge on other academic areas .but if one feels that obtaining a doctorate or masters in a particular field is enough to be specialized then that person is mistaken .specialization means that a person have indepth knowledge about everything in a subject area and this includes keeping tab with current events in that subject area .to be specialized and hence successful in one s chosen field the person should keep learning in the subject .i once asked my uncle who is a highly successful and respected doctor in india that what made him so good .his answer was that i am not good i am still learning .once i have accumumaled all the knowledge there is to obtain in my field will i be good and that can never happen .so when you are at the crossroads in your life and have to make a decision as to whether to obtain broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject , chose the specialization .
