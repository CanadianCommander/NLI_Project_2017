advertisement is meant to attract people attention in order to sell a product .in this case , i agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .advertising companies use people s psychology in the way they present a product .they can make fusture customers relate to the products , and ultimately buy it .advertising companies rely on how people relate to their products : for example , a brand of shampoo may want to reach out to stay at home mothers and tell them that they will be `` sexy  and attractive by using it ; a company that sells baseball bats may want to reach to fathers and tell them that by buying thair bats and playing with their sons , they will be heros .it is not necessarily the product in itself that attract people , but how the advertisement is presented and the idea behind it .not every advertised product is good .for example , i saw an ad on tv about a vaccum .the ad said that the vacuum could even clean bacteries from the air and that it deep cleans the carpet .it looked good to me , so i bought it : the vaccum broke the next day .there is no real way from knowing if a product is good or bad because there are so many advertisements nowadays .the only way of knowing is by trying out the product ; and by that time , the advertisement company achieved one thing : selling their product .advertisement is a part of our society to the point where we can not tell what is true and what is not in the matters of products : what brand is really better ?do we take price into account ?as a customer , there is so much to take into account that we end up being confused and choosing what `` looks  good .advertisers know how to make use of this fast-paced society , where people do not have time to look closely at a product before buying it .it is ultimately the way the product is presented that makes them profit ; not the quality of the product .
