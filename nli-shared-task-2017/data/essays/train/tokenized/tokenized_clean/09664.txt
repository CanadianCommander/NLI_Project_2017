the issue at hand is that whether knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialization in any one particular subject .i believe that specialization in a particular subject is a better than having knowledge about many subjects .i believe so because specialized form of knowledge leads to complete knowledge about the subject at hand .firstly , i beleive that specialization in a particular subject is a better option because it involves greater in depth analysis of various details and its influence on other things as well .for example , consider a heart specialist doctor who has specialization in heart surgery .such a doctor is better than other general physicians when it comes to heart related ailments .such a specialist is in a better state to advise things related to heart problems .additionally , specialization in a subject is better because a specialist can do the research work related to a particular specialized field more effectively and efficiently .a research done by a specialist is more credible than a research done by a non-specialist .for example , newton was a specialist in his field , so his research and discoveries are still considered great works in his fields .any one can not do such a research and lead to great discoveries , but only a specialist like newton can .finally , in my views , a person with specialized knowledge about a particular subject is better able to communicate things and impart knowledge to others .to bolster this , consider the point that all our professors and lecturers in our schools and colleges are specialists in their fields .a physics professor will be able to teach physics more effectively than any a science teacher who has superficial knowledge about that subject .so , by stating all these points i conclude that specialized form of subject knowledge is better than superficial knowledge about many different academic subjects .a specialist is the only person whose has great in depth knowledge about the subject at hand .
