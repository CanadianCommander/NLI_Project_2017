in my opinion , i strongly feel that one should be a specialist in what he/she does and this specialization can only be achieved when he/she undergoes systematic education in that specific subject .there are lot of pros and cons associated to this topic of discussion .to begin with , i would like to mention a few advantages of not specializing in one subject .by having a broad knowledge , the person keeps his options open and waits for the right opportunity to strike at the right time .as an example , when we apply it to the context of acquiring a job , this leaves him/her with some aspect of certainty that if the job market/behavior changes its orientation because of certain issues , he/she still has the ability to get himself/herself a decent job because of the knowledge gained in many academic subjects .when it comes to a specialized person , i feel that he has many advantages over his couterpart .being focussed in one particular field , one can dedicate lot of `` time & effort  and be motivated to work in this field .he gets to learn this from people who have specialized in this field .he is almost certain that he know the industry causes-needs situation .he is trained to deal with every possible shortcomings in his filed of specialization .he has the confidence to independently deal with the problems .apart from all these personal advantages , he helps the industry in recruiting the right candidate for the open job position .this leaves the industry with some sort of relief of finding the right person for the position .on a person note , i would like to focus on my academic background and discuss the reasons that help me adhere to my opinion .in the final year of the undergraduate studies , i had to complete a project work .i developed interest in this field and succesfully completed the project work with good grades .but at the back of my mind , i had this certain level of incompleteness because during the course of my project work , i came across certain issues which needed more specialized education .it was at that time , i decided that i should be enrolled for a masters program to get my doubts solved and to gain better perspective into this specific subject .on the other hand , i could have completed the task and very superficially call myself and expert .now my thirst of knowledge has further increased as i feel that i should not leave my education midway and continue with a doctoral degree which will certainly make me an expert in this field .therefore , i feel that being perfect in a field helps rather than getting involved into things which you are not very good at .as its rightly said `` jack of all trades , master of none  .
