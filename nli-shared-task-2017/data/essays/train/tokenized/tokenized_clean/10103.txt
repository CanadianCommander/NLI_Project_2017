`` do advertisements make product semm much better than the really are ?i agree that most advertisements do so .sicen this topic is acontroversial issue , i suppose that different people have different ideas on it .some people may think it is not true because almost all advitisement are through tv programs or pictures .they tell us the real figure of a project .so the people wonder how the picture of a product become better of their looking than it really is .however , those who think so downplay or overlook the following three important points .first , generally speaking , the role of advertisements is to make the good impression of the product for cunstermer .without thes effect , advertisements are not ` advertisement  in the real meaning .apart form the wrong advertisement , almost all ones make product seem much better than they really are .second , i have the experience of buying a product by being derived by the advirtisement .i bought a pc , but it was not the one i wanted .this shows that the looks of the product that i saw at the tv program was different from the real one .this is the way to sell a product , and it is the real role of advertisement .third , as i mentioned , some people may believe that tv programs and pictures image the real aspect of a product .however it is false .in the process of making advertisement , makers use several kinds of scientific methods in order to make custermers believe that the product is realy good .that is , they change apearrence of the product , and give us the good impression on it .by using the effet , like visional effect , the maker make the unreal image of the product .the aforementioed three reasons are persuasive .therefore , i agree that most advertisements make product semm much better than the really are
