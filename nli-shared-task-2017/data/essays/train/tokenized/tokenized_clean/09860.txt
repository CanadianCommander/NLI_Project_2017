i argee with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their communities .with the development of technologies , more and more funny products are coming into exsitence and entering peoples  daily life .so it is not surprising to find that young people would spend hours on pc games alone , instead of taking care of or talking to some old people in hospital .take computer as an example .a survey shows that global computer selling is contuniously growing , and so with the demand .and some teenagers do claim that computer is their best friend .with computers , they are able to chat with oversea friends , watching latest hot movies , or surfing on the internet .since the time in a day is 24 hours , which is eaqul to every one , they of course do not have more time left to help their communities .by contrast , teenagers in the old days did not have such kind of entertainment .therefore , it was common for them to visit and help others  families in their community .moreover , freedom resolution started in california of united states in the 1960s showed a wrong example to young people .instead of having a steady belief in god in mind , more and more people choose to believe nothing , which has already proved by a report on european citizens .it is indeed correct that the nature of human beings is to help each other , but having some belief will enhance your feeling to giving a hand .so lacking belief has surely a negative impact of those young people nowadays .to sum up , i argue that too many kinds of entertainments and lack of belief lead to the fact the young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .but i not saying that they are more selfish than before , rendering that there are just more aspects of life to pay attention to .in order to make some changes to this situation , i would advise parents to spend more time on their children and show them some positive examples .
