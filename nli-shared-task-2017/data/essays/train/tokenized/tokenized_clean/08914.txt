teenagers have always been the hope and the backbone of our society .just like the relationship between teachers and students , teenagers bares the burden of achieving greater success than their parents .but does this mean that the older generation s lives are easier and happier than young people ?no , i neither agree or disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .first , we will talk about young people .nowadays , young people are the representation of our fast-changing society .to most of them , life is a tideous fact which they can not escape .faced with large amounts of academic studies in school , family pressure such as not fulfilling their demans to achieve good marks at school , and also family violence and the possibiliy of loosing a father or mother from a early divorce .young people today are also threatened with the corruption of our society .our media influences our young minds with movies , music , news and advertisements .and what do young people learn from them ?violence , sex , dishonest , and many more unvirtous things .a great example would be the increasing number of young gang members in our sociey .many of them were born and raised just like any other children , but the moment they turn on the 50 cent rap songs , they are addicted .addicted not only by the beat of the music , but also corrupted by its contents .many of them began to immitate certain celebraties they adore without realizing whether the things they learn from these so-called `` artists  are teaching them .some of them might even start walking the road towards crime .so can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?i do nt think so .on the other hand , the older generation face new problems too .today , we live in a world with little or no morale contiousness .in countires such as china , the old confucianism which binded the traditional way of life is disappearing .children do not respect the elders no more , they can argue with rudeness , they can have sex before they get married , they can smoke in school , they can dress themselves like whores and criminals .although our governments have fundings for the old people when they retire , but that s not what old people really want .most old people have experienced wealth , fame and love , they do not need elegant houses and expensive cars .they just need a good physical and mental health .and despite the little amount of money for any old person to live other than the medical fees , what they need is love , love and caring from their kids .statistics have shown that a lot of old people die of lonelyness and frustration other than physical illnesses .all that said , do older people live better lives than young people ?i think neither .finally , i conclude that neither young or old people have enjoy life more .the young troubled with pressures within themselves , they are faced with social and family pressures .the old are left alone and isolated from the rest of the society as if they are useless .to improve the situation , i think the only solution is instead of wealth and fame , people should pay more attention to morale principles .
