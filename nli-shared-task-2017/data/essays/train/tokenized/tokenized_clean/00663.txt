i have traveled many places throughout my life .i love to travel with my parents , but of course , there were many times that we traveled in a group led by a tour guide .i personally prefer to travel without a group and definately to travel without a tour guide .the first summer vacation that my parents and i went to japan , i was only six years old .we were with a group of people , and there was a tour guide .every historical place or any amusement park we went , we traveled with a big tour bus .the tour guide would then explained details for information that tourists should know .though it seemed to be useful , i felt most of the time i was `` trapped ,  and `` bored .and i wanted to see this very phenomenal temple on our way to the hotel , but i was told not to do so because we were on the group ; it was not on the schedule .i felt it was such a disappointment .in addition , i could not have stay in a place where i wanted to stay longer ; daily schedule was already written for us , and the place we went might not be the one i was interested in .i have travled to hong kong , united states , korea , and japan alone or with my parents .it was such a big difference compare to if i was with a group .i could do everything i wanted .i was free to stop by a comestic shop whenever i felt like it .my time was flexible .it was the best when i acutally went to korea and stayed with my friends  houses .they brought me to places that i do nt think i would go if i was with a group .for instance , my friend s grandparents garden and places where famous band concerts performed .it was incredibly entertaining and that is why i am passionate about traveling without a group led by a tour guide .though there are reasons i partly liked to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i do not think that is the best way to travel .i am more comfortable either traveling alone or with my parents because it not only benefits the relationship between me and my family , i also see the world larger in this point of view .
