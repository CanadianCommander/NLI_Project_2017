some people think that young people do not spend their time to do something that is beneficial for their society .but i do not agree this opinion .the most primary reason for this is that modern many university student are much more ready to be the one of member of workers than those in the past .some illustrations of that is they join internships , experience the works as a part-time job , and study abroad to master english .my fatehr said to me that he did not have to study or experience work like today .moreover , as people can prolong teir lives , young people have to help them nowadays .it is critisized that there are so many old people in japan , where i live in .i think that it is only young people who can help with their living .to summerize above passege , young people nowadays can not help giving much more time to help thir community as the system of teir society is changing .
