i agree that advertisements today really try to drag you in their product with fake pictures .advertisements today have been a big influence to many people including teens adults and also children .the way advertisements work are simple .advertisements can be looked at like lies just that people do nt know it .most of advertisements today have been to promote a certain product or company .this type of business has helped many people be succesful in their particular goal of reaching what they wanted through advertisements .advertisements have been used over many years to pull the audience into the product .this is the key to all advertisements .for example if it s a advertisement on food the picture they show on the food is made just to attract the audience not to really show how the food is but to attract them .the certain plate could be just a banana but the picture could be edited so it looks very good for the customer to buy it .many companies have a section in their company focusing in advertising .they have these sections so that they know what the audience weakness can be and how they can attract that audience into buying their product .another example of an advertisement can be some deoderant advertisement .axe has a comercial where the man who uses this product sprays this product on his body .after he used this product the women would be very attracted to him .this comercial promoted that it could either smell good or attract many women .in conclusion i agree that advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .all this is done just to make money .so next time watch out to what products are being advertised and know that it can be a lie .
