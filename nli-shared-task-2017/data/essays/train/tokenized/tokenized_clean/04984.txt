i think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that is the way that the buyer can show interest in the product and ask more about it .nevertheles , it is a dangerous form of publicity because some things that are saying about the product are not true .i think that the advertisements that more use this kind of `` lies  is the telemarketing when they show a lot of people saying that one product or another is the best that are in the market , and the problem with these products is that we ca nt see it or touch it before we buy it .so we take a risk buying a product that we really do nt know .althougt the advertisement for other products that we can see and touch are more realistic , some times show better things that they really have .publicity is the best way for a company to show its products , but the buyers believe more in a company when they are telling always the truth and when the show a product with its real characteristics , and for a company the loyalty that shows their clients is the most important thing .some times , it is not that the advertisement seem much better than they really are but is the customer who thinks that the product is better that it really is .
