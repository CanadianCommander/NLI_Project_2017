i most certainly agree the idea that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .i want to defing enjoying life as how much passoin they have in their life and the example of hign school student in korea and america varify the statement .first of all , korean students know how to spend their life through participating many works , demonstraing that korean teenagers try to challenge and move than older people .when older people try to stay what they do , students want to move around places to experience as many as possible to learn about other culture and what to improve for themselves .also , i want to show you example when they finish their final exam .they study all the time after school and prepare for the final exam .so after the test , they do anything to solve their stress .they go to computer room and spend all night and they sing song before they can not sing , showing that how much passion they have in their life and know how to enjoy the life .second , i would like to introduce when i was in america .one thing that i was surprised is about sports in their life .american high school has three season for their sports and they try to prepare for it two month before the beginnig of their season .they practice as hard as they can to defeat their opponents .during the season , they sometimes rejoy to death when they win and even cry when they lose .through sports , they learn about life and try to win everytime by live hard as they can with passion .however , adults in america is very inactive in their life .most of people try to earn easy money and spend it quickly .they do not enjoy their job and feel very hard about their life .as can be seen above , those who have passion in their lfe know how to enjoy life and spend it great .i hope i enjoy my life even though i get old a
