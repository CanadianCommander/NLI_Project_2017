i do not agree with this statement .i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .this is because if a person has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and if he does not specialize in any of them then he would be a best example of `` jack of all trades but specialist of none .this would definetly not prove useful for him and for the society as a whole .he will not be in a position to contribute anything , because he does not know any subject in-dept .if he just has a broad view of many subjects , then in the later stages of his life , that is after his graduation , he would remain in a confused state of mind , and he will not be in a position to settle on one particular field .i am saying this confidentally because i faced a similar situation in my own life .when i was in my college studying b-tech ( biotechnology ) , i used to give equal importance to all my subjects .so after my graduation i was in dilemma , and i was finally confused with my profession .i was not able to settle down on one particular subject .so i would suggest that it would be better that we choose one particular subject in which we are highly interested , and then put our soul and mind into it , to learn the subject thoroughly and perfectly .in this way we will have a greater in-sight into the subject and we will be in a position to contribute something from our side for the betterment of the subject .
