young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities no i dont agree to the above statement .in the present generation people are able to earn money by many ways .in olden days rich are allways rich and poor are allways poor .poor people can not go to school they bont have any support from any one .the development in the poor people area is very less .in the present days people have came to know about the importance of education so every one started going to school there are maintaings there surroundings neat clean .those days there are no clubs , play grounds , camps .if childrens want to go to school they need walk miles .but in these days we can see clubs play grounds , schools and many things in each and every colony .these young people are able to earn money a lot they are able to spend for them self and helping others .even though they might not help in direct through hand but they are donating monry to some clubs .by this i like to say that young people are helping for the development of there communities .
