nowadays , the society is changed and it s becomed a society which primar value is time : people never have time .this lessance of time can be read also in human relations .this behaviour is clear in young people .regarding their behaviour , something is evident .young people opften have not respect of others and never have time to spend for the community and helping it .sometimes it seems thay live in a word apart .they do nt look to the needs of people around and they even never think to make something to help them .many examples occurr everyday to support this idea .the first , about the respect for other people , can be inferred , for example when youngs often smile about other people s desease ; it happens to see an old woman in difficult to cross the street and near her a group of adolescents , looking at her ; well , it is really unusual seeing them helping her to bring the bags or simply to cross the street .another sign is about volontars ; many of them are old people and there s a little quantity of young people .for example , in my city , every sunday there s a group of people who spend the day to make something helpful for society : sometimes we go to clean the parks , or other days we wash the walls from wrintings ; well during my experience i never met young people .another example can be simply inferred from school s world : at the beginning of the year , teachers invite their students having meeting to plan activity in group : i always went and i found only the teacher .and it is worst if we talk about meetings to help students at the first year .concluding , it is really difficult involving young people in useful projects ; i care this is a sign of proceeding time and of parents , not able in teaching an important life s value , whinch is to collaborate with other people and to be ready in helping the next .
