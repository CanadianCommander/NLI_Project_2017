cars are among the greatest inventions of the time .acting as a product of modern technolody , cars have greatly enhanced our mobility .whenever we want to visit friends , watch a play , or take our children to school , they re always there .aware of all these benefits , i still believe that the number of cars will greatly decline in two decades .so serious is the environmental problem on earth that we re forced into looking for their origins .cars are mainly responsible for the air pollution .hardly can anyone find pure blue sky in a car-intense city .being regarded as of great use , we fail to recognize how many tons of poisonuous gas they produce everytime we drive on the road .we have no choice but to limit the use of cars , or else our descendants will only have access to blue sky in the photos and their parents  memories .meanwhile , take a look at the traffic jams in big cities .most people live in noise , work in noise and die in noise .how many people are in the hospital , concerning ear problems because of the noise ?numerous .how many lives are deprived of by traffic accidents ?countless .who is the killer ?the cars .cars are so dangerous that we re doomed to reduce their number in the future .with the advance of civilization , there will be fewer cars in the future .while some people still live under the illusion that cars are somehow helpful , pollution , noise and accidents are already too high a price we paid for the use of this transportation .if cars are not limited , the blue sky , the clean atmosphere , the sense of security of people , will all become a golden memory .
