i would nt agree with this statement .of course , it is very important to have a good overview over all academic subjects .but after having achieved this one should decide on what is most interesting to oneself and specialize in this specific subject .first of all , trying to stay broad in one s knowledge means to preventing oneself in specializing in a specific area .but without doing this , it is not possible to gain a deep understanding of any subject and there is the danger that one is just scratching the surface .this is particularly important nowadays .each of the academic areas has grown extensively in knowledge and experience so that it is even impossible to get a full understanding of just a single area .furthermore , in order to produce new scientific results or new thoughts in an academic area it is important to have a good knowledge of the latest developments in this specific area .this is can just be achieved by concentrating and working hard on one subject .moreover , i think that it is important to devolop interests , and maybe sometimes also disinterests , in certain areas during one s academic education .as far as i have experienced this , it is just possible to achieve great results in a subject when one is interested in the material and thus is able to develop enthusiasm for one s one work .always forcing a person to deal with things that are not so important for he or she , the person will feel uncomfortable with his or her work .so , specializing in a particular acamdemic area helps and supports the development of own interests and thus increases one one productivity .
