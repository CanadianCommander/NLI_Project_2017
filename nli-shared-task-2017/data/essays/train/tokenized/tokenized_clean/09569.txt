i concede with the point of view , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i agree , that students have to learn a lot of hard facts to gain a substantial basis of knowledge .with this gained `` ground-knowledge  they are able to work in their specific community or surrounding .every science has its specific speech and skills that are known by everyone in that community .but to be able to cope with tasks , that students will be faced in their professional and private life , it is important , that they do understand the idea that are behind the facts .to point it out , knowledge by hard and learned facts is not sustainable , because you can forget parts of the facts .in this case the student is not able any more to overview the whole issue .that means , a student who understands the ideas and concepts behind the facts is able to cope with new tasks , that will emerge .the student is more prepared if he can adopt the ideas and concepts .with the ideas he can create new solutions .in addition it is much easier to forget facts rather than ideas and concepts .to understand means , that a student is more open to new issues , than a student who can just recall his learned facts .also the time , that is spent by students to learn the facts by hard is less effective than to learn the concept .to understand means also to gain tacit knowledge , that is in your hard and not codified .facts are codified , for instance in books or standards .but if a student understand the ideas and concepts , he is able to gain tacit knowledge , that is just owned by him and singular .in conclusion it is more effective to understand the concepts behind the facts , because it makes a student better prepared for situations that suddenly occur .in mz opinion it is really important to be prepared to handle with siisues , that are nor commonly known and therefor the best a student can do is to achieve the knowledge how to do something .i am c
