successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i can only support this statement , because one will never be more successfull than others , if one does not try out new thinks .and for trying out something new one has to take the risk to fail , or to get hurt .this implies the fact , that successful people have to be very confident .confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on , eventhough something did not work .because this is what happes all the time when you risk something , sometimes it might work , sometimes you will fail .of course being successful does not only mean having a big job career , one can be successful in sports , school , family , organizing life ect .but in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new things .if you always walk the same path like the others you will never step out off the mass .but walking new paths asks for alot of courage , which people can get when they get older and more experienced .so finaly i want to say everybody has the chance to be successful , they just have to be willing to take the risk .
