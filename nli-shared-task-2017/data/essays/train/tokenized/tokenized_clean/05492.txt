i agree with this statement , but i would like to clarify the term sucess first .what does it mean ?i understand success as a moment in a person s life when s/he achieves a very significant goal that had before , in that sense might be happiness , joy or perhaps money .after this definition , i consider sucessful people usually take risks and try new things , but base on their own experience and knowledge and taking into account the advantges and the disadvantages that the new idea could brings up .in that sense it s not just take risks , it implies a wise understanding of the situation .i believe it is very comfortable to keep doing the same things that you already know , but at the same time `` monotony  it s something that does nt allow to prosper and literally destroy our dreams .there are many examples of people who had taken risks in their lives and failed , but at the same time you can take risks as much as you want , there is no limitation about it .i definetly empatized with this point of view , because if you want to be happy or to be leader you have to struggle and get your dreams , they wo nt come by praying or by miracle .sucessful people are always trying to be different and looking for new targets with a very clear idea in their minds and with many arguments to support their plans .muy last argument is , our life is a very dynamic and a opportunity to create alernatives .people who have been working only under the same paradigms are wasting an unvaluable opportunity to shine and to achieve their goals .hence sucess people area always looking forward for planning new strategies in their life and be happy for ever .
