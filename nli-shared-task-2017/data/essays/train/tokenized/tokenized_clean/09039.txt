nowadays , we can see lots of young peole who go out with their friends , go to the movies and enjoy parties .some youth think that they are the happiest people in the world .youth are more active than older peole and looks enjoy their lives .so they might enjoy life more than order do .but in my opinion , old people really enjoy life more than younger peole .first of all , old people have lots of experience .they live longer than youth and have many different situations .sometimes , they had really hard time to recover their failure and they had unforgetable days in their lives .whenever they have hard time , they do nt give up and try to recover it .and by having these experiences , they can enjoy their life .also , they have more friends than younger peole .because they ve already been to elementary school , middle school , high school , and college , they have really good friends who are always with them and help them a lot .during living for a long time , old peole could have friends who adviced them whenever they had hard time .so old people really enjoy their life with their forever friends .furthermore , in the case of adults , they achieved their hopes .they have studied and had many failure to get jobs that they want to have .by having those days , they experienced a lot and finally achieved things what they want .so they can enjoy life more than young people .young people enjoy their life by playing and having lots of parties with their friends .but older people enjoy life more and know how to enjoy their life because they have enough experience and more real friends .thus , i do nt agree that young people enjoy life more than older peole do .
