the given statement is true and relevant for the use in life .it is agreed that if there are no risks in life , and that new things are not trried , it would be a cotidian and common world where nothing new could be seen .it would be like a mechanism , like a machine type of work .you were designeds to do something every day , and that is what you have to do every day in life , like a computer .it is designed to be used for work activites and in some cases for entreteinment , but there will be nothing new in a computer if there is not a creation of a new invetion or idea for the progress of that computer .off cource that there will be risks .if the product is not accepted by society , then it will be a loss of product and a loss of money , but that is a risk that must be taken in order to make a company grow .if people are closed minded and does not agree with many new things than the society we live on will not be in any way successful .it would be a conformist society that just want the necesary things .it would in part also a sellfish society , where the people will ony worry for themselves and would just ignore the problems that the rest of the society , and even the world has .which in a way , is not correct .there should be an improval in all the things , as history has shown us .time has shown that if there is no growth then we would still be in the prehistoric era , where the people could nt even knew how to talk or how to exand their own ideas .but we have seen that some humans take the risks , and are also shown as an example of the growth in society , and the exceptional work that humans can do .because of their risks we have seen an evolution in human days and life , if there was not a risk , then not even technology could have started .industrialisation , technology , and many other things that complenent the socienty we live on , are the causes and the effects that were reached by the successful on the risking of society .for exapmle , if an alber einstein would nt exsist , or a leonardo davinchi , what might have been of science and religion , and literature .what about aristotle , the founder of `` university  , if it would nt have been for these men , we would nt have any education .they risked their own lives on trying to make humans life better in knowledge , and in the capacity of learning new things .they gave away a great amount of time where they could have engoyed with their family , and even , they could have done something common .but in the matter of fact , they chosed to analyze things deeper , and show society that life can be better , and that there will always be risks to take , but it will be on your hands to take them or not .it will be your desition to change your life and differ from the common way of life .
