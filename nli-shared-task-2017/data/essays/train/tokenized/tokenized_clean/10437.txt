i believe successful people like to take risks and are not afraid to engage new situations .success is being in control of one self in order to achieved certain goals .if you believe you can do it , you have much higher chances to obtaining that .successful people are motivated to try new things , to be creative , and to follow objectives even if the situation changes .successfull people differ from ordinary people becasue they take risks .for example : most of all great business ideas are innovative .what makes a business man successful is the way he or she manages to develop the business model .most probably , it will requiere to invest both time and money to an entrepeneur activity .it will also requiere to learn new things , maybe processes and managerial skills .to do so , it demands to learn new things and to take risks .in the other hand , ordinary people are most likely to stay where they are , in what i call comfort zone .they are not willing to take chances , and usually bypass great oportunities because they believe that it is too risky or too hard to achieve .basically , i differentiate people by their attitud .successful ones , have a positive attitud toward change and are self confident .they believe thay can achieve it .and even if they fail , their attitud rise them up again to keep on developing greater ideas .success is a continious activity , not a goal you reach and it is over .they are many examples of success .i like to state my own experience .i have worked for 3 years achieving professional goals , and learning new activities .i have been recognized for my committment , and now i work as general manager for the company .i have great attitud toward change and problem solution .i have made my mistakes but always learned from them .i believe everything is posible when you are clear about it .now a days , i am on my way to study a specialized master degree , ready to learn new things , to share my own ideas and listen to others .i believe success is a way of living .
