before responding to the question , it s important to consider actual problems that young people have to face every day .nowadays it s more difficult for young people to find a job than in the past .they must study very much and hard to increase their chances .competition is a key point that stesses people who need also to be as more skilled as possible .so they need to attend university and more time is required to end their studies .for the same reason , their parents have less time to look after and educate them , expecially if the mother is not a housework .in fact , the society demand is greater than in the past in all fields , and it requires more speed .so people run from one place to another to respect their appointments .the result is that young people are more stessed and not enough educated .my experience suggests me that this guys will grow up with many problems than people who have parents who love them and teach them how to behave .generally , they are more individualist and prefer to spend their time playing videogames and not helping their relatives or the community .this could lead to problems in the society that are difficult to resolve .this is the common sense , but i do nt completely agree with this thesis .there are many young people that spend their time in good activities .for esample , when i was a teenager , i frequently helped my relatives in their jobs , or the prist in the church that i frequented .i know many teenagers that every day spend their time in hospitals , or simply they help their grandparents at home .
