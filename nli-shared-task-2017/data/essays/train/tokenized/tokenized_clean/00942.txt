people normally think that people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well can have succeful life .however , i think that it is really dangerous thinking and i strongly disagree with this .there are three main reasons and examples why i disagree with the statement .first , it has really low percentage of success .when people try new things there are always a lot of risk .since new things are not known and proved the people always take the risks .and sometimes it can be really dangerous for the people .if what the people try to do is succeed , then he/she can be a hero and others may respect them .however , that does not normally happen in our lives .so it can be really dangerous for you to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you know how to do well .for example , if you work for a company and you need to finish your project .then you do not follow the standard guide lines and you try a new way to do the project .if your boss like the project , that is really lucky and good for you but normally that is really hard .you might get fired because of your new way to do the project .second , the statement seems right because there are some people who have become famous because of their new thinkings and tries .however , it is really rare situation .only few people actually succeed by their new ideas and unusual tries .then they look really good because they can be famous .for example , novel became really famous by making dinamites .he tried new thinngs and finally invented really useful equipment .but if he failed his work , no one would know him thesesdays .only when you succeed your try , people will respect you and remember you .otherwise , you fail your work and no one cares about it .third , you can still succeed even though you do not try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you already know how to do well .success does not always require your new attempt .success is just depends on your personal values .for example , if your value is earning money and having a nice family , you do not have to try new things and face risks .you can still have successful life without any new tries .success deals with your personal values much more than what you actually do .as above , the percentage of success is really low when you try knew things , and it is really hard to succeed by doing new thing .also you can still succeed even though you do not try new things rather than onlu doing what you already know how to do well .therefore , i disagree with the statement .
