movement or rather transport is an esential part of day to day activity .cars are included in one of the many means of road transport .coming to the topic proper , i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the near future to come .there are many reasons as to why i support my decision .firstly , the technology is advancing in leaps and bounds .so , in the near future , cars would be available at a cheaper rate to the commom people .the advancing technology would also help in combating the problem of air pollution by devoloping cars that run on electricity or hydro power .the science can also be used to produce more fuel efficient cars which would inturn help in conserving our limited natural resources .the present world is becoming more developed and the basic attitude of a developed society is to maintain good status .cars indicate the status of a person financially .thus more and more people would be inclined to buy cars in the near future .coming to the most important factor , `` the safety factor  .travelling in a car is far more safer than travelling on bike .this fact has been recently prooved .last but not the least , when it comes to individual concerns , luxury takes the upper hand .cars are far more luxurios than other conventional vehicles .for example , one would prefer to travel in a car with the ac on , rather than travelling on a bike under the scorching heat of the sun .ruling out some facts that cars are robust , and things like that i conclude my topic by saying authentically that there will be more cars in the near future to come .
