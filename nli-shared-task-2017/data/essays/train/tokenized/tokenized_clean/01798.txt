it is sometimes difficult to discuss if young people do not spend too much to help their communities .some people may agree that young peolpe do nt help others , while oyhers tend to state that young people help each others the their communities all the time .however , i have also come to my own opinion that young people do not spend much time on helping their communities .first , as techonolgies improve , too many recreations could deflect the concentration of young kids .for instance , the video games and internet , created in late 1980 s , provide much more visual pleasure that before .so more and moer young people would like to spend all their to play games or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their communities .unlike young kid before , who did have more time to interact with other members in their communities , young people nowadays have less topics of communities , except games , to discuss .so they do nt share their lives with their communities , no mention to help their communities .second , in my opinion , fewer and fewer young people nowadays do realize the meaning of helping others .it is a pitty that even in the school , teachers rarely instruct the real virtues of human .all the teachers ask young kids to do is that they should forcus on themslves , not others .they just acquire knowlege form textbooks , but they do nt learn how to deal with other people , respect other peoplem , and even help other people .as a result , they do not give any support to their communities , because they do nt how to do and what to do .thay is not to say , of course , that other points of views are without merit .i am sure that there are do some young kids serving others .however , on the basis of the above mentioned , i think the reasons i have provided in favor of my position are build on a solid foundation .
