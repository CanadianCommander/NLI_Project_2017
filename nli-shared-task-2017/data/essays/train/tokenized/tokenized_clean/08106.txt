on the one hand , the following statement about advertisement show us that there is a real opposition .as far as i m concerned i would say that it seems to be true about this , because advertisements are present to inform people about something .but as we can remarque , is that finally people doesnt understand all the signification on them .but on the other hand , we can remaraue that peaple take lots of interest about them because they product better than they really are .for example , we can underline that children or teenagers points theirs fingers on them because advertisements creates a social movement .be at the top is very important for young people .everyone want to show to the other that he can bring or wear what he saw on the advertisement .that s why , sometime , avertisements can products much than they are .but , there is differents form of advertisements .so i think that , its create the difference .obviously , internet , tv program or paper in the street can influence people bying .that why , i can say that advertising take a big place and certainly most .
