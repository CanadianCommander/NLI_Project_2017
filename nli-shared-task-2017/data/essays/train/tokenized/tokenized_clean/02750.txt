in today s world , having a broad knowledge can defenitly help people in the society .they can apply for divers jobs , or they can even have two jobs , contrary to someone who is specialized in only one subject .but being specialized in only one subject means that the person knows his job perfectly , so he can have more chances to be hired for a specific kind of job .in my opinion , i think that having a broad knowledge is better than specializing in only one subject .we were spoken with my american civilisation teacher about that .is it better to do his master and to continue his doctorate on the same topic or we may change to show our skills ?that day i simply told him that knowledge is one of the most important things in live , we use it at school , but we can use it to give help to some people , for example , in high school , or in middle class .we can also be a teacher .we can teach french and english for example .moreover , not only to help people but for also for us .we can proove to ourself that we can learn different subjects , we can understand them , and finally be good at them .it can be seen as a way to be proud of ourself and having the feeling to be part of the society , as far as we are concerned by many points .however , having a broad knowledge means studying and also learning a lot , so we can be tired because of it , and not share time with his friends , his family , going to the cinema .it looks like having no fun , and to considering it that way , life can be boring .to conclude , i have tried to explain the reasons why having a broad knowledge can be useful ( help , proud ) but we must consider that this point of view can be limited .
