the argument proposed compare two completely different way of thinking life .for someone a fully way of living implies taking some risks .only facing risky choices people can improve their life status and their own satisfaction .on the other hand , many other people think - and consequently organize their life - to minimize or avoid any kind of risk .this type of people attribute a great value on safety .my personal feeling and approach about this matter is flexible .i think there is not an absolute best way of playing lives but it depends strictly on the attiutde of the people .by the way , in my opinion trying new thinks is a wonderful experience and an important factor of human growth .first of all , i think that a wide range of experiences get the people richer .if i compare my point of view , my culture and my feelings with different one , my mindset could be more open .this is the reason why i travel a lot and i have decided to work for some periods of my life abroad .i think it is very limited to pass all our life in the native village .probably it is a safer choice but absolutely less interesting !second , if no one take risks in this world and try to experiment something new the progress does not exist .in a world like this we could not appreciate all innovations .i m thinking in particluar about technology improvements that in last decades have simplfied and improved dramatically our society and our lives .we could find another example on pharmaceutical research industry .if pharmaceutical industry continue to produce the same medicines and does not spend a lot of money on research there is any possibility to increase our life expectation .risky choices of scientist and manager in pharmaceuticals have delivered the possibility to do more , feel better , live longer for many people .
