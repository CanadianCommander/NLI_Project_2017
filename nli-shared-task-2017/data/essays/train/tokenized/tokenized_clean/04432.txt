people have different opinions on whether young people do not give enough time to helping their friends .people who oppose this statement argue that helping friends is most important role in friendship .however , i supported this idea for two reasons .let me explain reasons in details .first of all , nowadays youngsters have lots of things to do for their own .for this reason they usually do not pay attention to their friends  problems and just concentrate their own works .let me take my experience as an example .when i was in high school student , i had an car accident near my school .that day , our school had an important midterm examination .although it was not seriou accident , i had to be care of by someone .however , for preparing test anyone helped me .my friends had to hit the book before the exam .so they just called teacher for me and went back to their class .i disppointed from them .therefore , nowadays teenagers usually deal with their own work .next , recently people can find easily to solve the problems not from their communities but also from other special institues .in the past , if teenagers had a hard time to study , they asked their best friends and solved together .for example , if students who are not good at math , they can share the information how to study math .this is because they were same situation .however , todays we have a lot of academic institutes and private tutoring agency .therefore , young students have abundant sources which can help them to solve their problems effectively .they can ask them how to study , what they have to take , and how to solve the problems .this shows that youngs do nt have time to share theirtimt wiht friends .in conclusion , i agree with the idea which is that recently young people do not have enough time to concerning their friends .as i mentioned above , they are suppose to focus on their own jobs .in addition , they can solve their problems by contacting other sources around them .
