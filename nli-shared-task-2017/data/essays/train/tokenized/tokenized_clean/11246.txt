while some people have a deep and specific knowledge of one subject , others have a broad knowledge of many subjects .the question arises which of those options is better .i persoally agree with the statement and think that a broad knowledge is better .if you have a deep knowledge of one specific topic , you surely are a specialist in your specific field of interest .you may call yourself an expert .you can work on one topic that you like and that maybe has become part of your life .however , the disadvantage is that you only have specific knowledge , which in the worst case could lead to a lack of understanding for other topics .as life has lots of facets , it would be useful in my opinion to have a broad knowledge of topics which concern the world we live in .although with a broad knowledge you are never excellent in one specific topic and may not see your own academic development in your field of interest , you gain an insight in various subjects and , which is most important , you can also use your knowledge in daily life situations .that knowledge can in a way widen your horizon and maybe it could as well be very useful .if you can speak lots of language for example , this could be handy for you when you go on holidays and find yourself in conversations with native speakers .in this daily life situation it is more useful to speak a few languages in an average way than to speak one language perfectly .i think you can not say in general if it is always better to have a broad knowledge or a specific knowledge .it appearently depends on the character of the person and his or her preferences .nevertheless , maybe you could also make a comprise .you could have your own specific subject but at the same you could confront yourself with other subjects in order not to lose yourself in one specific topic .
