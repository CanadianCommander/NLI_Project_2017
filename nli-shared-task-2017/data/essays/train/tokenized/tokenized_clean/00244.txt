i think specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .in the academic life in universities , every student wishing to graduate from the university must represent a specific subject as finishing project .after than for instance , a specific issue is selected in the master s degree .every scholar is expected to focus on a specific issue .moreover , no one can claim to be best at all fields .in this sense , there are many sub-titles below the issues .as a graduate from the international relations department , i can give many sub-titles such as europe , middle east , far east , territorial waters , weapons of mass destruction , etc . ..examining one specific topic gives the person more detailed information on that subject , subsequently she/he will be called as a expert on that subject .by getting more and more information on the subject she/he will be more self-confident person .if a sensitive issues are raised on the subject , she will be applied firstly in order to get her thoughts .writing books or essays on a specific topic could enable her to gain more prestige as well as more money .paralel to raising in her/his profession , living standarts will also improve .on the other hand everyone has some information about the daily life .the people must attach importance to the politics , economy and international relations .we must take an active roles in all social platforms in order to audit the political process .we must keep a close eye on the happenings in daily lifes .
