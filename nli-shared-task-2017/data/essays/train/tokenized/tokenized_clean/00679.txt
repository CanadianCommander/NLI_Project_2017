young people have always been seen as a future of their community and are expected to work for the betterment of their community .i feel that young people do take care and try and help in growing their communities .the world is growing and people are well aware that it is ` survival of the fittest  policy that runs their lives .anybody in that case would want to make a place for their community in this expanding world .young people are very much aware of what the community has done for them and are always ready to help their community by giving in their efforts and time .young people know what they mean to the community they belong to and in this social world , they do most of what he can do to help his community .for instance we can take an example of mr. dhiru bhai ambani and his children .mr. ambani has always been interested in his community which is gujarti .he has always been working hard to improve gujrat as a state .and this is continued by their sons mr. mukesh and mr. anil .the men who have their biggest project in gujrat jus to improve employment and economic condition of their community ( gujaratis ) ...they could have that big project in metro politan cities that have better resources and climatic conditions .they spend a lot of time to help needy people in gujrat and do what they can for them so , this can be sighted as one of the best examples for young people do for their community .in this world where time is no less than money , people do spend time in charity , sponsoring funds for their community works , helping poor , counsellin their community members , attending their community meetings , finding out ways for the betterment of their community , managing their community functions .young people are more enthusiastically participating in the above mentioned activities which gives them satisfication .they try and spend lots of time and work for their community which is worth mentioning .we can also take an example of ` orkut .com  where communities are rapidly increasing .also people registering in each community is increasing day by day .this serves as an evidence of how people spend time in helping their communities by giving in forums which are very helpful for the growth of the community .thus young people are the ones who are going to handle their communities and i think they are responsible enough for it !!
