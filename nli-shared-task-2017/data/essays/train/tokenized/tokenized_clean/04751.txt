in twenty years from now the world is going to change drastically in many ways and one of the ways will be the means of conveyance that one is using to commute .i agree with the fact that the personal means of conveyance like the cars will decrease in number .people will start preferring public transport means like metro rails , trains , etc .with the increasing traffic problems in countries especially like india people have started preferring public traonsport like trains to their personal cars .in a recent survey conducted it was shown that the number of people who prefer trains to their cars have increased by 9 % in the past three years .because of the commotion on the streets because of the large number of vehicles if one has to reach a place some 10km away he has to leave an hour ago to reach the place on time while in trains he can reach the place in 15mins .this saves a lot of his time and he can be sure of reaching the place on time .secondly with the increasing awareness for pollution control , the cars that are a major contribution to pollution should be checked .pollution control is very essential to control the temperature of the earth ( global warming ) .the temperature of earth is rapidly increasing which if continues to rise will melt the antarctica and then earth would become extinct .pollution is one of the major cause of this temperature increase .cars cause a lot of pollution and in order to check pollution the number of cars in the coming years is bound to decrease .studies have showed that earth s temperature has shown a rapid rise in the past two-three years and it is mainly due to pollution .the cars play a major role in polluting the air .so the number of cars on the streeets will soon be controlled .with the decrease in the resources like petroleum and diesel which will become extinct in few years if not controlled effectively , it is expected that the number of cars on the streets will reduce giving way to public transport that uses electricity .cars that run on diesel and diesel and petroleum will reduce in number to put these limited resources to better use .there are cars that run on electricity but still for other reasons like traffic commotion ; coming twenty years will record a fall in the number of cars .time waits for nobody so public transport that saves time will be more in vogue that the cars in the recent years .
