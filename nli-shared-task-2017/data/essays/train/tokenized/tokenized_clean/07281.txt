the statement asserts that in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , i completely disagree with the statements for several reasons .first of all , there are no substitution for cars .today , there are a lot of public transportation like buses , subways and monorails .however , it does not reduces a number of cars these days .in fact , a number of cars are increasing rapidly these days .people uses their cars for personal reasons like shopping and moving their luggages .taxies might substitue this purpose however it costs a lot .no one want to use the taxies for personal usage because it s cost .in my opinion , nothing can substitute need for personal cars .second , there are many countries in africa and all over the world .they do nt eat food well .furthermore , they do nt even think about cars .however , in twenty years , many contries which are in poverty and danger now will be developed .individuals in developed contries might want to have their own car .it will increase a number of cars in twenty years .third , car mania s are increasing now a days .they want to have more than two cars to show off .someone have 5 cars by it s makers like bmw , lexus , honda , hyundai , ford .in fact , in china , there are more makers we do nt know .it will grow rapidly and many car manias might want to have more cars .finally , the population of world are increasing .as the population of world is growing need for car will be growing .when new babies become a high school student in twenty years , they need to buy cars for moving or go to school or for socail activities .someone might buy cars more than one like car manias .in my view , growing population also imply growing a number of cars .in sum , i fully disagree with the statement .because there are no substitution for cars , developing countries will need for personal cars , and car mania s will increase too and people who want cars will increase .for those reasons , i strongly oppose to the statement .
