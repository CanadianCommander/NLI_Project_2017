i agree with the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .there are three reasons for this .first , the goal of a company is selling the product .second , advertisement make people buy their product in indivisual way .a company which own the product s goal is making their profit and that way , the company make people to think that the product is nessesary for them .the company s goal is selling their products as many as they can .therefore , poeple who are making a advertisement make better looking than real product and use it for the advertisement .for example , .in taco bell advertisement , half-pound beef and potato burrito looks bigger than the burrito from taco bell in our town .advertisements make people think that the product is a neccesary item .few days ago , i saw a old navy commercial , they kind of made me think that if i do nt wear their jeans , i just do nt belong to our younger men community .so , i bought the product but it looks as same as jeans i got two months ago .advertisement is for a company which is selling the product s profit and it make most people to think that the product is what they need .i was kind of addicted to television home shipping few years ago , the seller in the homeshopping mentioned about what kind of people need their product .he said , younger or older ladies and gentlemen .instead of saying everybody .that product was a pen with the light by the way .this kind of mind contral makes people that product is nessesary even if they are not very important product .
