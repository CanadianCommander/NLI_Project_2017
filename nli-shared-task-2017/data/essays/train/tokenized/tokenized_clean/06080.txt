first of all , having broad knowledge in many academic subjects is necessary to be able to understand the world we live in , particularly the economic , political and social issues .indeed , broad knowledge of many academic subjects , which are espacially tought at school and at the university , allows you to get a general and personal culture of almost every subject , like history , geography or literrature .of course , in that way you can not be a specialist of all those subjects , but at least you can discuss with people and have your own opinion about things .on top of that , broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes you more mature and confident to start learning additionnal specific subjects .it is , then , necesary to have this general knowledge to be able to go on .however , specializing in on specific subject makes you more performant on a specific topic you are interested in , and allows you to enhance your own skills by making research or reading magazine about it .thus , you become a specialist of the subject and may be the best in that subject .besides , when you are specialized and maybe passionnate about something , you can try to find a job related to your specialization and be good at it .as for me , the both statements expressed in that sentence are both correct and necessary .indeed , as we wo nt never be aware of all the subjects , it is the best to have broad knowledge about the most possible things , to be able to understand the issues , the problems and more generally the world .but then , we should specialize in a subject we really like , in order to concentrate on a personnal interest and to improve our knowledge about a specific topic .that is why , the best for me would be to combine both of those aspects that is to say first learn the most academic subjects we can to be able , then , to specialize and be good in a specific subject .
