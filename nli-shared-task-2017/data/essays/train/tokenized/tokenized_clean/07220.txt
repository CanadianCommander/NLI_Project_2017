i desagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand idera and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .factors make students to face on the reality , help students to understand ideas and concepts better , and make student more attention about the field .one of reasons i desagree with this idea is because students should know the reality .if students just study about ideas and concepts , they can never lean what is going on in the real world .for example , in business class , students will learn about stocks .if students do not do a similation game of marketing stocks , they will never know how it is diffecult to guess what is going to happen next one second .facts help students to learn the real world by themselves .in addition , if students learn many facts , it is going to help students to understand ideas and concepts more .for instance , in business class again , through a similation game of marketing stocks , students understand what stocks are about , why companies have stocks , and so on better .it is more effective than just learning ideas and concepts .finally , learing through facts can make students to be interested in that field .in fact , a similation game of marketing stocks made me to be interested in business world .i had never been interested in business at all untill i did a similation game .i knew the facts of business world and it caught my mind somehow .besides , i am majoring in business in college now .there are more studets who had the same experience .in conclusion , it is better to learn more about facts than ideas and concepts .however , it is wrong that learning only facts are the best way to learn something .it is also important to understnd ideas and concepts .it is just learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts .
