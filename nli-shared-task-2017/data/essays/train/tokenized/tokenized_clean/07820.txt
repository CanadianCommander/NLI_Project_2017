i agree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .the reasons that make me feel so are as follows :firstly , having a broader knowledge in many subjects helps us a lot in our everyday activities .after all , the subjects we learn are useless unless we know how and where to apply them .we come accross many aspects in our day to day life where in the need for application of knowledge we gained arises .people who have specialized knowledge in one subject will not be able to apply it frequently as the issues would nt always involve the same problems regarding the same subject .we can share our knowledge with many others if we have an idea of all the subjects .one can involve himself in a discussion among a group of people if he knows few important points about the topic or the subject .people with specialized knowledge are always less in number considering the fact that there are many subjects and different people may specialize in different subjects .discussions often lead to important revelations that one would be unaware of before that .this is not possible usually when the person has specialized knowledge as it would be very difficult for such a person to find a similar person with the same specialization to involve himself in a discussion with .another important advantege for people with broader knowledge of many subjects is that they would be able to think in many ways , in different directions .these people have greater domain knowledge than those with specialized knowledge whose thinking abilities would be restricted .people come to conclusions and solve the different problems they face based on what they see , hear and learn .their thought would be provoked higher if the domain on which it is based is large .hence , people with specialized knowledge have their thinking confined to fewer areas than those with broader knowledge , though not complete and specialized .the points made above are the reasons on which my decision to agree with the given statement lies upon .practical application of knowledge and way of thinking are two important areas which are to be concentrated on .when these two issues are considered , along with many others , broader knowledge is recomended as it provides the person with opportunities for further development .
