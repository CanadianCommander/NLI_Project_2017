some people may think specializing in one specific subject is better .however , personally , i believe it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects .there are two reasons for this .the primary reason is that the new areas of academic subject have been created often by combining some subjects .for example , portfolio magement theory which won novel prize was created by combination of mathmatics/statistics and economics .if the resercher who won the prize was engaged only in traditional economics , it was impossible for him to develope this epochmaking theory .in general , the evolution of the area of finance theory has been depending on the combination of math , statistics , economics , phycology , and a lot of other subject .this is quite good thing .another reason is that it is good for the future convenient of both students and proffessors to have broad knowledge .in other words , broad knowledge increases the probability that they can turn their academic area into good direction .for instance , one of my proffessors in university who has been an expert of computer science deveoped his career in new area , the law of patent .while he has studied computer science , he has become aware that the new technology can not alway be money .the obstacle for him was the law of patent .after being an expert of the law of patent , he is respected as an expert who can understand technology and the law related to patent .considering with all of the above factors , i would like to claim that we should aquire borad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specialize in just one specific subject .by aquiring broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can increase the probability to create new academic area and to develope our career flexibly .
