i think the community has to help itself , it is not only a moral obligation of young people !what do you mean for young people ?teenagers ?a 30 years old man is still young , but he is not a young man for the community !all the people have to give time to helping the community !all the people do not care about the others , only a few people , like the men who go to africa to helping the poor populations !they give all their life to helping the community .as you can see they are not young people , so all the people do not give time to helping , above all the youngs .but now the society is different , it is not like 50 years ago , there s been a lot of changes , the people need different things , nowadays a young man need to study , to realise himself !how can i help a person if i do not feel well ?i have to realise myself , i have to study , sometimes i have to relax , sometimes i need to have fun .young people are a particular kind of people , but i think they are the most important part , they are the future , so they have to realise themselves and a day they will be able to help other people , but not today , it is not the most important thing now ; the old men can help the others , because they do not have other things to do , now they can use what they learn in the past !may be in the past the young people had more responsabilities , i do not know , and i can not , but as i said before , the time has changed , the time is a circle , today it is your turn , tomorrow it will be mine .i m young and i ll have time to help the others , i wish , now i have to care about myself .
