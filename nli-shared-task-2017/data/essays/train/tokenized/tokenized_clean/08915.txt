numerous people live together in our society .some people are young , and others are old .sometimes , we can hear that older people say to young prople `` i envy you because you are enjoying your life so much .however , i doubt the idea which young people enjoy their lives more than older people .as far as i am concerned , they are too busy to enjoy their lives because young people have a lot of responsibilities to have to do .first , young people have to study for their future .for example , high school students in korea spend over 15 hours to study every day .in my case , i have been studied toefl over 10 hours a day after i decided to go a university abroad .do you think that we seem to enjoy our lives ?second , young people have to earn money hardly to support their children .one of my friends hate his job .he is working as engineer , but he actual dream is to be a writer for novel .however , he can not quit the job becuase his son was just born last year .he does nt think that he can afford his family doing what he really wants .how sad it is !finally , young people a lot of concerns about their future .for example , according a research , 80 % of korean junior high school students answer that they are not happy to the question  are you happy ?  because they get tons of stresses from study and feel nervous about their futures .it is not diffrent for people who work after graduating school .many people are not satisfied with their lives and are worried about their future .they are young ; it means they have a lot of difficulties for the future for them .therefore , i ca nt agree with the idea which young people enjoy their life more than older people .actually , i belive that they could more enjoy they lives when they get older after they are done on their responsibilities .
