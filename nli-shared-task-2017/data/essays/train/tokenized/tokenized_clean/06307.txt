i agree with the most advertisements ( ad ) make products seem much better that they really are .there is two resons such that ad s pictuers or tv comashales are not same as real products , and ad have to show that the products are looking nice .the first of all , most ad are over acting because ad s pictuers are very butifule and look nice .for example , some buger chane restrant give us the ad on tv .in the tv , the bugers are very big and fresh , but real one is not look a like ad s .also , car ad is as well as the burger ad because the car run in the mountan for faster but in the real life , nomal car can not do that .so ads are shown much better that real one by creaters .the next , ad have to show the products that are looking nice , so ads are made much better than real ones .the ad have to grab or cach people s interest , so ads are made nicer than real .for example , if a restlant give an ad to people , they make some foods pictuers .the pictuers are have to look nice .the picters can not smell so creater make some trick to look smell good .pople look the pictuer .they think the restlant make such nice food and then they would go .so the ad is made nicer than real one because it have to look nice .most ads are made much better than real once becasue ad s and real product are not same because for example , the humbirger is not looking same as ad s .and the other reson is that the ads have to look nice becaseu of advrtisements .the ad have to foock the people as many as they can .therefor ads  products and real one are not same .
