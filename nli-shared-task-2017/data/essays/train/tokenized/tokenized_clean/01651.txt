recently , i had a chance to have brief meeting with tom who just came back from the europe trip and i was able to hear abou the valuable stories and funny episodes .however , he strongly mentioned about the lessons given by the trip and also eagerly tries to advise me that without a tour guide tourists are capable of making a trip more interesting and memorizable .convinced by tom , i do not agree with the statement that `` the best way to travle is in a group led by a tour guide  due to two main reasons .first of all , by depending on the tour guide , tourists dangerously lose their resposibilities and also deeply become dependent .for example , let us say there are two babies who have been raised differently .the first baby , jimmy has been gifted with a couple who belive that babies must be raised with great care ; on the other hand , the jeffrey has been raised by believers who desire their babies to bocome less dependable .most likely , jimmy raised with great care will be excessibly so dependent that when he reaches to the time to work in a company , he will have many problems based on the disability to solve problems independently .however , jeffrey will be really strong and does give up in society even though adversities try to block him .secondly , without the tour guide , the tourists tend to more colaborate each other in a group and naturally make their trip more voluable and memorizable .like i mentioned in the previous paragraph , being independent is really important element for people in society , but also knowing how to work with coworkers is significant .according to tom , he said that he had a lot of hard times to find places he and others in the group want to visit .and he added that because poeple more tend to be collaborative and agreeable , they could have very successful and inerasable trip .in conclusion , by depending on a tour guide , it will be little valuable trip in the reaons of the high cost for it .so , if some wants to have wonderful , memorizable trip , he or she have to avoid a tour guide who probably takes his or her independence .
