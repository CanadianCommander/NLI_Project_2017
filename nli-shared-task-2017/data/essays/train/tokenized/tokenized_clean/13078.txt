yes , i completely agree with the statement `` youngpeople enjoy life more than older people do  .we live our lifes to our fullest when we are young , leaving behind the worries and the intricasies of old age .so i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energitic , with young minds fresh from college , with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out .`` old is gold  is a popular saying the some people advocate .they think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better that the younger blood .but i feel that a younger blood has lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than a older indivisual can .like , a project to be completed with a deadline .a younger person can work late nights and will finish the project no matter what come in his way .he will work harder to make a place for him in this world .the older people have mind that are worn out , by age , by time .whereas a younger mind have lot of ideas to offer .these are fresh brains , that have come right from college , filled with all sorts of new tools and the virgour to put those tools to action .and also there is no burden of a family to support .a younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife , his chilldren , his home ... , this list can go endless .above all the dating of girl , gives you so , divine a feeling that hardly can be expressed by words .we can date a lot of girls , enjoy parties , go to different clubs , chill out and do whatever we like .there is none to stop us or brooding over us to get home quickly , as your son is getting late to go to his soccer practice or your daughter has to go to beauty parlour .i feel that this world is meant for the younger generation , and they have to live life to the fullest in this period only .
