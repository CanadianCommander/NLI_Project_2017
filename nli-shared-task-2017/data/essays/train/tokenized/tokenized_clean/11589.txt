there are many aspects that are done on the the students to make them learn and tow essential ways that students follow and do while they are learning .one way is understanding concept while the other is learning facts .i agree that it is more important for students to got ideas and concepts than learning only the facts without understanding for many reasons like the believe of the subject and aquiring the ability to apply the concepts with the understanding .if student learn information without understand how it come , there would be apossibilty one day the information would be changed according to the weak understanding of its concepts .for example , i know an old man who think that the earth is a sphere and he kept this information for many years .after decades the man changes his mind since he saw prooves that the earth is a sphere even he believed in the past that it is not a sphere ! .so the understanding of the concepts would make stronger believed than if the information was just learned to the students .the ability of applying any thing that is in our mind will vary depending on the way that we got the information in it .it woud not be easy for the students who just learn facts to apply them and imagin how the facts would work on the reality while it would be so easy for the students who know the concepts to deal with any topic regarding it and it would be enthosiastic for them to dael with it and apply it since they already konw where and why it came from .for instance , there is tow students who want to do research on particular topic .the one who know the reasons of the topic deal with the research perfectly with the other student does not .in conclosion , understanding concepts is much more better than learning facts since the believe will be higher and the applying would be more when the student understand ideas and concepts .i advise all the educational companied to show the facts to the student rather than only learning facts .
