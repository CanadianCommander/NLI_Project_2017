in the same way that people from different cultures enjoy life in different ways , i am convinced that older people can enjoy life just as much as younger people do .however , older people enjoy different things in life .first , i believe that people change their definition of happiness as they grow older .while young people would most likely associate the thought of enjoying life with the practice of physical activities , or a busy nightlife , i am tempted to believe that older people would tend to relate enjoyment to more intellectual activitites such as reading , writing , or any artistic activity .second , older people have financial resources that allow them to do things that they were not able to do when they were younger .for instance , older people generally have a more significant budget to travel all over the world .i can still remember spending entire summers working in construction in order to pay for my extra-curricular activites during the academic year .now , i have the ability to take several weeks off and spend all my time traveling to foreign countries .finally , i am convinced that you only enjoy life once you really understand its value .older people have more experience , and understand the value of friendship , community and other things that make anyone s life enjoyable .i would argue that younger people do not always have the same ability to step back and enjoy what they have in the than older people .i remember that i would only care about sports while i was in high school .although the feeling of being a performant athlete provided many opportunities to enjoy life , i look at it differently now .when i think about these times , i think about how i could have enjoyed this experience more thoroughly if i had been more mature .in conclusion , i would strongly argue that older people can enjoy just as much as young people do .it is just a matter of defining your expectations from life , and having the ablity to understand your own happiness .
