young people often resemble an attitude of interest to the most important issues , regardless of the amount of the time they give to actually help their communities it is very difficult to meet someone that is completly not interested .i personnaly find very important that there is a social awareness of what si going on in any specific community and probably the young people involved play a leading role in in what their communities will look like in the future .looking the communities with a positive and understanding eye is not something that only adults should do .lots and lots of activities are done in communities and the majority of them are well organized , young people in general attend to many of them and contribute significantly to the evolving proccess of communities .of course there is a lot done by the local religious communities in wich maybe there is sometimes a lack of young people .i personally live inside a community where the local church organizes places where all the young , ages from seven to eighteen can play soccer and always attend mass as help for the priest .the high sense in these cases of very strong religious factors can build up very strong communities and avoid the spreading of violence and indifference .looking in a positive way to my communitiy made me appreciate all of these organizations and participating to some activities and allowed me to instore some of the best friendships of my life .looking back at some of the best years of my childhood i see a lot my time in my community .
