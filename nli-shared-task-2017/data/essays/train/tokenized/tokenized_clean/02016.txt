ideas and concepts are building blocks of learning and understanding facts .merely learning facts is not going to help .if students are stuffed with facts , then what is the difference between a student and a book .ideas come from interactions which are of different types .the importance of idea and concepts is very much high .the important thing is that facts can be derived if concepts are clear .facts can easily manipulated and tempered with .in other words facts are not that much reliable .but if students are loaded with correct concept and innovative ideas incorrect facts can be corrected .facts only talk about a particular situation .they dont deal in general .again the underlining thing is that facts dont provide the wider picture which a student should look for .learning fact can sometimes affect the thought process in wrong direction as they may be manipulated .for eg. falling of apple a fact but the idea and concept is gravitational force .understanding gravitation helped the whole human race .had this been regarded as a fact only , many things would not hane been possible .the above example explains how merely learning facts will not help students .innovative ideas are the things that have helped the humankind from the onset .ideas and concepts are the breeding grounds of facts .if students are armed with ideas and concepts developing facts is not going to pose any problem .what is required is a balanced approach towards this .students should be taught to generate ideas and concepts and should be encouraged to find facts .
