i am agree with the young people enjoy more the life that the older people .young people can have more information about different activities that take place in the city where they are living .young people has internet , it means that they can rich information about events , concert , outside activities , ect .also , they are more concious about eat healthy , sllep well and eunoght time , they know that if you practic any sport you will be able to work with more energy that you optend whend you practice an sport because is no more stress in your body .actually , young people can find so many diferrent sport activities that can brind to them a work up where cardio work would be covert , also all the mussels of them bodies .morover , all this extrem sport that the young peoplel are practicing can be a risk for them because can produce a big accident with a bad consequences .this sports give to the person that is doing a hight douse of adrenalin that make the boby feel somenthing that can get from another thing .it means that the sensatin that those sports can produce could nt be comparet with any other sport .in conclusion , i think practices extren sport can give to you a satisfastion .i stroungly think that came help you your body to be healthy because you are putting a sustan un your body that keep your braind alert .thus is really importan that the young people practic the extrem sport but wiht resposability because if they do this whitout protection and they do nt fallow al the rules so many unhappy consecuens can happen , practic this sport save can be the big different between life or dead , consecuence that can change them life and sometimes other life .
