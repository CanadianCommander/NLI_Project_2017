it has been such a long time since i completed my academic education and has been working as a professional that it is impossible for me not to agree with this statement .sooner or later school comes to an end and professional world starts .in the turkish educational system you have to decide on what you want to do at a very early age and that decision does not always turn out to be the ` right  one for you .what are you suppose to do when you realise that you have made the wrong decision at the very beginning .it is very hard to start from all over again .as an experienced professional i belive having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is always better than specializing in one specific subject , for it gives you the space , in other words the freedom you need until you decide what you really want to do .it will be easier for a person with many aspects to get a job in the professional world rather than wait for the ` specific  opportunity .when one applies for a job it will be to his benefit to be aware of many subjects , for the bosses are usually looking for young people with a broad vision , eager to learn and capable of applying what they have learned .i also believe that after deciding that one is on the right path , specializing in that field is inevitable if one wants to promote .i would like to finish with giving an example from myself ; i graduated from business administration , i worked in a travel agency , in a factoring company and at the moment working for a non-profit organization as an expert on the european union and i owe all this to the broad knowledge of many academic subjects i learned in school .
