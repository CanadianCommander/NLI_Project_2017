in germany the education is based on a fast variaty of subjects you can learn .in the so called `` gymnasium  it is very important to teach the students as many subjects and topics as possible .so that every student recieves a broad knowledge and general knowledge .but is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one specific subject ?in my opinion a misture of both is the best solution .on the one hand it is very important for well educated people to have a very good general knowlegde concerning every topic and subject .it helps you in everyday life to understand certain things better and to improve the situation within the society .for example there are news on the the iraque war on tv .to understand the situation you have to have background information on the situation in iraque and the reasons for the war .on the other hand it is not always possible to know everything .maybe you have good qualities in languages and social studies but you are not very intrested in science or mathematics .you can share your knowledge in certain topics with other and you can profit from the others .in class for example , my friend is very good in mathematics and i am not .so i can learn from her and she can profit from knowledge in history .i think you should concentrate on one certain topic that you are very familliar with but should not leave other topics out .then your knowledge gets to one sitted and you may loose track of other important things and happenings .all in all i think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just to specialize on one but in addition you can specify on one so that you can share your personal knowledge with others .
