i totally agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , for two simple reasons : personally , professionally , first of all , i think in my case i will grow more as a person , meaning that i will study more of many things , not only concentrating in one specific subject .that makes me , in my opinion , more interesting and usefull .for example : reading , which is part of studiying , is so important for us to obtain knowlege , so it will help us through getting all that broad knowlege we want .and eventually we have a lot more opportunities for jobs , which leads me to my second reason : professionally .this gives me such an advantage in getting a job , because i cover many subjects , so there are more open opportunities for me out there .it s good to know many subjects because you can be very usefull at not one , but many things .
