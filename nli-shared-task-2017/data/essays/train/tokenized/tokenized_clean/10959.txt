`` the new generation  is a very critisized topic these days .young people often give out the example of a modernised generation who care about nothing but temselves and how to stay entertained .even though young people always seem to be preocupied with themselves , they do care , in a way , about helping their communities .it is true that they do not show it as much as older people do but that does not mean that this new generation does not care about helping their communities .after all , they are part of their community , so by helping it they end up helping themselves .for example , young people will tend to help their communities by making it seem more enjoyable .they will plan numerous activities for different events , like trick or treeting and costume parties for halaween .by doing that they entertain people of all sorts of age : children will be happy as well as their parents who will enjoy spending time with their family .now of course this example might not be very revealent for older people who think that by helping the community you must decrease the number of unemployments , help the elderly , organise charity events . ..but younger people , are not always aware of the importance of these sorts of problems , which is why they do not give it attention .this does mean that teenagers do not care about these social problems but it will take more time for them to understand how important they are for the community .by saying that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  , we give out the impression that they are spoiled kids who do not give attention to their environment .that is why i disagree with this statement .both teenagers and children help their society by not even noticing .for example , they are aware of not throwing their rubbish on the streets .by knowing that they help decrease the pollution rising in our world today .of course , they would not be helping their communtity as much as adults do , but it is a fresh good start that proves that this lack of care of the `` new generation  is not always true .
