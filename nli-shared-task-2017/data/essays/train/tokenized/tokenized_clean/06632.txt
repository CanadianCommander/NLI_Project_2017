based on my experience i disagree with the statement .from my point of view organized tour trips are more expensive , they lack of flexibility in order to arrange unexpected activities , and they loose the emotion of travelling to a different country and discover the real life and culture , two aspects you can not find out in the touristic scheduled tours .i have travelled twice with an organized tour guide .in both ocassions the trip cost me much more than if i had organized it by myself .it is true that you can get very good group discounts , however the hotels they take you are more expensive than the ones you can find by yourself for example in a guide book like ` lonely planet  , through internet or friends references .the lack of flexibily in a tour guide is another reason that made me organize the trips by myself .organizing the trip by yourself , you can customized your routes , visiting only those places you are really interested in , without having to visit every single place the guide believes as interesting .finally and for me the most important reason , it is the discovery of the country s culture .normally , the tour guide trip follows a route which takes the tourist to the most touristic places in the country , places plenty of foreigners and few local people .travelling alone , you can can decide to visit totally unknown places for foreigner where you can speak in a natural way with the locals , learning how the really live in a dailybasis .as i mentioned before my experienced made me organized trips by myself instead of hiring tour guides trips .my economy , the flexibility of customize my routes and my interest for other cultures made me choose these trips as the best way to seize and enjoy a trip abroad
