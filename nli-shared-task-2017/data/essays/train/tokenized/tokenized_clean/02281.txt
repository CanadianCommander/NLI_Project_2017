wheter it is more appropriate to receive a broad education or a specialized one is a common yet difficult question to answer .i would like to adress it quoting my personal experience .being naturally curious , during my childhood at college and high school , i tried to discover as many topics as possible .hence , i did all my best in every course , not neglecting my weakest points ( biology for instance ) in favor of my centers of interest ( languages , mathematics , sports ) .this led me into mastering most of the subjects and therefore i was frequently in top-five rankings .my first moto was a thirst for knowledge , but it rapidly turned to be an advantage .indeed , thanks to my efforts in all topics to get a broad knowldege , i was considered as a good over-all student and was offered a lot of opportunities as regards my superior studies .this was the first benefit of my wide stock of knowledge : being acknowledge as a capable - if not talented - student .i continued my studies in the scientific area , in order to get an engineer degree , as i was interested in the automotive industry .of course , the education i received was much more specialised than the previous i got .anyway , i did not focus only on majors , like mathematics and science .my eclectic tastes pushed me to keep on studying thoroughly what were considered secondary topics , such as litterature or even exotic languages ( italian for example ) .hence , even if it compelled me to provide more efforts in order to perform well at all exams , i have been able to add more strings to my bows than what an average engineer has .the effect of such a personal commitment is clearly benfecial today in my job .as an engineer , i am considered by my fellows as a man of letter .my skills at languages and my interest for history and cultures enable me to tackle more easily several situations like dealing with foreign customers or partners .this is an asset over my teammates and it has contributed in promoting me to positions that would be hardly accessible to a mere engineer of my age .besides , today i am proposed several opprtunities abroad that would be unthinkable without the `` extra-skills  i have always tried to get .of course , i can not deny that the specialization i needed to become an engineer is useful , as it was a pre-requisite to my career .anyway , i think that without my widest background , i would have been limited in my career evolution , as it is the case for some of my friends .besides , on a more personal point of view , having a wide rang of knowedge , even basic one , provides you with a lot more confidence when tackling problems and especially unexpected events .indeed , it can broaden your thiiking , thanks to word meanings ( languages ) or analogies ( sciences ) , and therefore help you to figure out different solutions or approaches .last but not least , a borad knowledge keeps you open to the world , as it does not make you think too narrowly .to conclude , i would say that specialization ; ight help
