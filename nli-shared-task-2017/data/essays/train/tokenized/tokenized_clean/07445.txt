i agree with the statement , as the the most important thing for a student is to understand ideas and concepts in order to develop critical thinking and good judgement .first , only by understanding ideas and concepts students can use what they have learned in school and apply it to real life situations .by understanding concepts and ideas , a student can develop the so called `` critical thinking  that is the capacity to judge a fact or an idea with maturity and good judgement .without critical thinking , prople woul nt be able toassess everyday life situations maturely and make the right decisions .for instance , how good a lawyer would be if he could recall all the regulation in a certain area of law but could nt interpret the regulation itself ?he would certainly master the facts but he would nt understand the concept .i am sure most lawyers would agree with me that in law , more often than no , knowing how to interpret a law is more valuable than knowing the written reguataion .second , by learning and memorizing facts , students only develop skills that are not as necessary for business or other professions .for instance , there is not much value in memorizing hundreds of pages of a marketing concepts if a student is not going to apply that specific knowledge in a financial analyst profession .much batter would be , if the student understand and master marketing ideas and concepts that can be applied to his profession as well .the same applies for other subjects such as math .if a students knows only memorizes formulas but ca nt apply those , his knowledge of math will be probably usless .third , when students learn and memorize facts they do it only for the purpose of taking a test and not for the purpose of learning something .the result that most of what the student learn will be lost few weeks later .this is clearly an ineffective way of using the students time as memorizing requires a lot of time and energies that could be used to understand more ideas and concepts .to sum up , i believe students should focus on learning concepts and general ideas instead of wating time memorizing facts .
