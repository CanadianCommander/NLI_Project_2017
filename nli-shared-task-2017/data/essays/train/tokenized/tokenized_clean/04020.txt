i really do not agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do .i think they enjoy different areas of life but with the same intensity .it looks like that young people are having fun with a lot of physical activities because at that stage of their life the body is always full of energy and rich of sensations .on the other side i see a lot of old people prefer mental activities such as reading , meditation and conversation .this happens just because at their stage of life they learn and take advantage of their mental skills .for exemple , you can see in the same park a group of kids having a blast during a soccer game , and their grandparents sitting on a bench and be completly immerse in a conversation or reading a book .even with music we have two different worlds : young generation enjoy fast and laud music that they dance till they drop on the floor .adults get excited with less hectic music that they can listen and dance as well .but , if you go to a dance studio , you can see that regardless the age and the kind of music people is dancing , everybody is enjoing that activity .the intencity they put in what they are doing and the reward they get from what they are doing is not related to their age .they just get from different sorses of joy sorses that are more fitting with their physical and mental status of the age they have .my impression is that both , young and old people get a lot of joy from the activites that they choose .like i said at the begining , they choose very different ways to spend their time but the intencity and pleasure level they achive , i am sure is the same .
