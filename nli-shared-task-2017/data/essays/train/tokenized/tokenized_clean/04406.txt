whether most advertisements make their products seem much better than they really are ?different people have different opinions because of different way of thinking and experiences .as for me , it is true that advertisements always exaggerate their products and try their best to attract customers .why do i think so ?because i have my real unhappy experiences .for example , you can see the advertisement about shampoo everday .in the tv , the femal stars display their beautiful hair proundly and the shining hair is so realistic that everyone believes that he or she can have such beautiful hair as long as he use the product .so am i. my hair is brown , not straight and not black enough .so i bought one of the product to improve my hair , dreaming oneday to display my beautiful hair to my husband .but , the effect was not so obvious as the advertisement announced .i was really dispoint and today my hair is still not shinning and brown .here is also one real case of my friend s .everyone wants to be tall and handsome , but my friend is short and she is really upset abouth that .someday , she saw a great advertisement about a new type medical device which can increase your height .the advertisement also gave a lot of sucessful cases to confirm people that the medical machine really does work .it even promised that customers can take their money back if the device is ineffective .my friend was moved by the advertisement , rush out of the door and took one home from the company .she put on the device everday just as the explaining manul of the device told her .one month past , two month , then half a year , my friend was still short as she was .when she decided to return the medical device to the company and took her money back , she found that the company was not exist anymore .maybe some people will think that it is just a small percent of advertisements which cheat customers .but is there any natural or thorough difference between cheating and exaggeration ?everday there are people such things happen to .for example , `` perfect `` computer software make pc collapse tottally , `` unshrink  fabric make clothes still shrink after washing .obviously , most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are
