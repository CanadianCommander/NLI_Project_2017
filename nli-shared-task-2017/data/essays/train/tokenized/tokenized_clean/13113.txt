nowadays , the business of automobile is in great expansion .everyone use it in his everyday life because we often do activities , work or studies very far away from home .having a car has become the objectif of everyone who has his driver license .i m in this case .but it becomes more and more a problem of society .as far as i m concerned , i think that a lot of reasons will show us that driving a car is dangerous for the environement and that it s useless .i think that the development transports will replace the need of having a car .we can go almost everywhere in france for example with the train and in time record !we do nt need car to make a trip !moreover , the public transports in cities are the best way to move .it becomes really difficult to find parks and we are everyday stuck in traffic jams .in paris for exemple , we earn time to use the metro because the authorities do everything for driving a car to be a nightmare and a lost of time .people become stressed and it has an impact on the relations between them .but in fact , the actions of the authorities has a link with envirement .there is so much pollution everywhere and especially where cars are very present that everything is done to dissuade people to take the car .associations and lobbies who are imvolved in envirement questions try to show us how dangerous for our future it is to drive cars .i think that my generation understand the danger and will be ready in twenty years to use the other ways of locomotion if they are enough and concsiensously developped .the only thing which will change this prediction is the business of electric cars which are less dangerous for the future !
