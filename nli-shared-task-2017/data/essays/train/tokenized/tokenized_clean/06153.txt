many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree with them beacause of the fllowoing reasons .may be because they love the playing more than the work and that is real .other reason i think because they are less intelligent than the old people so they do not know enough about the correct things .first , young people like the playing so much .i think all the people like the playing so much but not as the young people .also i think that most of the young people have a school so they have to study more than the adults .so their free time will be very little and if they spend it at working i think they will get tired .in addation , their bodies are weaker than the adults so they can not do the same job just like the adults .next , i think the young people do not think about their communities because it is over their thinking .they have a limited brain .also they have a lot of fun which can make them busy .to sum it up , i think that the young people can not service the community as the adults .because of they like the playing so much .also they have a lot of fun and homeworks which can make them busy to work like the adults .
