i totally agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .professionals use good packaging , good image to make that product attractive to us .furthermore by the help of commercials we get use to them .good packaging makes products seem better .we are always affected by the big , colorful , fancy and bright things when we are trying to make a choice between two different things .we also choose what look nice as a package , but sometimes the result can suprise us .when i was a chind i was given a chance to select the president i want from two different choices .i chose the red one and then when we opened the boxes i realized that the light yellow ugly wrapped one was a better president .packaging in advertising may make you select wrong choice .seeing good outcomes of that product in advertisiment campains may not be correct .we are all afected by the image of that product but infact there may be nothing to do with that image and the product .for instance , we sometimes see an advertisement about a product and we think that if we wear that shoes we can jump as much as the basketballer .but infact it is not true that what advertisement shows as , it show us that product is a super product and it can help you jump more ofcourse it is not true .professionals in advertisement business are using media to show us and remind us that product more often then we get use to that product .as the time passes we slowly start to think that , it is shown everywhere , everybody is talking about it so it must be a good product .i remember when i was affected by a shampoo adertisement because i was seeing it on every wall and watching its commercial each night .when i bought that product i realized that i was not any better that the regular shampoo furthermore it was not making my hair i smooth as i used to have .in conclusion , i believe that professionals are using advertising as a dangerous and powerfull tool to influence people s opinion in order to make them believe that the product is better in one or other way from its competitors .
