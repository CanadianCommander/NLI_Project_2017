i agree with the statement .to make the point clearer , i have taken `` their communities  as their local communities where they live .i do not know how many young people attend their local community events or even strictly obey rules in their local community .examples are everywhere .one of the reasons would be that such behavior to help their local communities needs to be learned some way or another , but not learned .if young people lived with their parents or there were neighbors who had known them long time , they could learn it .if young people lived in the same place where they grew up , they would undestand naturally how to behave .but young people nowadays tend to live alone or only with their spouses and far from their hometowns .another reason is that since nowadays almost all the every day life is supported by business undertakings , people can live without helping their communities by themselves .
