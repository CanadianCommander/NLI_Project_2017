travelling is one of the most interesting beneficial , eye-opening , horizon-widenning hobbies a person couldn have .every time you travel and see a new place you get the chance to meet new people , be introduced to a new culture , and get acqaunted with new habits and tradtions , not to mention the food .yet travelling if not planned properly can end up to be a nightmare .lets say you have decided to travel to a far-away country where u know no one , and ca nt speak their language , u have never been there , and have no clue on what to expect .in this case its better to arrange your trip through a travel agent where she/he hooks you up with their partner in the country you are going to , to take care of you and arrange some guided group tours for you to go around and see the country .this can be the right choice in many situations .if you are going to a relatively unsafe country , where its not advised to wonder around alone .if you are worried that you wont be able to communicate with the people in that country because of the language .if you are travelling alone with no friends or family , and you want to socialize on your trip , being in group guided tours might be a good chance for you to meet people and have fun while site-seeing .at the same time u gaurantee to get enough information about the sites you visit on your trip , since the tour guide will be briefing you about each and every place you pass by .as much as this sounds safe , entertaining , and informative .i prefer to travel on my own .something i got used to and enjoy doing .i tend to find travelling on your own more interesting , and forces you in a way or another to mingle with the locals , to get more immersed into that culture , and get a better taste of that place you are visiting .besides , you would be able to follow your own schedule and go and see places you choose to see and not the tour guide planned for you to see .it would give you the chance to do some research and reading about that place , before and during your trip .you will be you own master , your own guide .our day to day life is already scheduled and going according to a certain plan , when i go on a holiday or travel , i do that to run away and relax .on my trip , i do nt need to sleep and wake up , eat or shop , according to someone s esle plan , not my own desire .otherwise i will end up not enjoying my trip while the tour guide ends up making lots of commission from each and every single shop or resteraunt she/he takes the group to , and most of the time they are bad choices .
