i think there is not a moment in your life more pleasant than other , the whole life is a cicles of growing personally and intelectually , and one should enjoy every step in this cicle , so i disagree with the statement .people should enjoy every moment in their lives , because every moment brings you different satisfactions and all of them are equally pleasant .as a child one enjoy a lot being in the kindergarden , and playing with the other children there isnt anything else more exiting than that .the same occurs as a student in highschool or at the university , meeting new people , sharing with them and all the things around it are very exiting .by this point there arent a lot of responsabilities , and that is what make people think that being younger you enjoy life more .but responsabilities do nt take away the exitement in life .after the university you star working , most people get married , have children and with this come the responsabilites , but who said this was nt pleasant .i still have no kids to take care of , but i really want to get married and have a lot of children , and i think i would continue enjoying life as i am right now as a young person .even work give great satisfactions , and i really enjoy working in things i like .it is all just moments in your life , and each moment give a diferent kind of satisfaction .in an older age , satisfaction must come from people around you , and the achivements you have done in your life .i think it must be very pleasant to see what you have done in your life and share it with the people you love .in conclusion one must enjoy every moment of life , because every moment comes with great satisfactionds
