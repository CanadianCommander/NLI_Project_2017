i think that it is good idea to go trip as a group with a guide .this is because tourists are able to know and get knowledge from the guide who knows a lot of thing about the place .if it is possible , people should have a guide and get knowledge from them because it can be nice oppotunity .the point is that people are travel to see other places where they are not live in their usual daily life .therefore , it is more reasonable to study other cultures and thinking .those ideas will probably help to make their thinking wider .in other words people who have seen many different countries or place are able to think everything more critically and logically , because they know why the cultures are differnt by taking a lecture of guides .also , it is important to make the group .the first reason is that people can learn from others , not only from the guide .if somebody in your grop can share the knowlege with you , it is great oppotunity to know other cultural thinking .if i compare group tour to private tour , it is clear that a person who is in a grop tour can think more different way beaacsue ther are others who has another idea which he has .in other hand , a person who takes tour by himself is going to keep his own idea , beacasue there are no others who provide othe point of view to him .the guide is the person who is specializing to teach history or local knowledge about him or her palace .as i mentioned in above , it is neccessary to know other cultures because you may think everything from many points of view .also , making group is easier way to understand how other people feel and think .therefore i think that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide .
