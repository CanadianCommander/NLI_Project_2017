in our society there are many communities representing the melting pot in our country .the idea that every single person represents the whole community has changed these past ten years .in the past the community represented a familly , a circle where people of the same apparence could stay together and grow .today , most of the young people grow without even knowing about major events , they are simply living in a virtual world based on the video-games , the cartoons . ..they do nt care about being up to date with international events , and major changes in the society .moreover , the youth is an age when one does nt really realize what implies being part of a social group .for example , groups are made with people who share the same purpose , more than the same shape or roots .this is why we can say that young people do nt spend much time trying to help their communities : they just do nt feel it s their community .i will use an example that occured in december 2005 in france , there has been several destructions in the ghettos near paris and many main cities .these children who were in majority less than twenty years old just reacted to what a politician said about a bad part of a certain community in the ghettos who keep on violating the laws : living as outlaws .they thought their community was insulted but it was in fact a group of gangsters who do nt represent any community .the fact is that young people lack q identity , being given an identity more than choosing one , by forgetting who they are and what is their true community .i think the most important thing is that young people receive a good education by their parents first and by the society : it is their role to be part of a society as they are citizen and own a citizenship .to conclude i would say that i agree with the fact that young people do nt help their community , given they lost their identity of being important actors of a society .
