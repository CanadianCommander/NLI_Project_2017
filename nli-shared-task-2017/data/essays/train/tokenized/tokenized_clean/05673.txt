some people want to be a successful person .however , other people do not try to be a perfect person .just , they feel shy by themselves as seeing and respect .i think that some people who want to get goals can become a successful person .whereas , other people who do not practice to be a good person would live usual life .so , i agree with that  successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .while i am living in present time , i have never seen people who do not want to be a wonderful person .as developing in socity , most people always pursue to get success from their degree .and konwledge continuously keep going on changing for fitting in new things .also we have to chang mind from old thinking to new one .for examples , we can see bill gate who is richman as employment of computer company .he constantly try to develope software or hardware until now .even thoug he has big house and has been became riceman , he never give up in his business and always concentrate on fousing how to make a special products .althogh he experienced failure , took risks in a whole part of his life or he already konw how to do well , he tries to do rather than another employment of computer company .therefor , he can do anything and then he can keep his work in top of firms .i like him because
