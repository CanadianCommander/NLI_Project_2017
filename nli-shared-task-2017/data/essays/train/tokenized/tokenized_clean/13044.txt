the way , professor should teach students has always been a heated debate .the question of the best academical system is not solved yet , and many scholars continue to propose alternative ways to teach .if we take a close look at the way education is organised in france , in germany or in the united states , we immediately realise that many different approaches are possible .how the professor should act in front of his students is not an easy question to answer .to claim whether a solution is better than another may seem , i acknowledge , a bit pretentious .but i am deeply convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .learning facts and figures are , in my opinion , the worst thing you can do in a universitywhat we are asking to a student nowadays , is to understand and to analyse immediately the situation he/she faces .this is what we call , the ability to react in front of an unexpected situation .this skill does not appear alone ; it must be worked and practised .the student must be able to think on his proper way , but he has also have to master some important theories which are the basis of our common and recognised society .for example , you can not speak about the evolution of the species without referring to darwin .but , once this general basis of common knowledge is acquired , then the student is perfectly able to evolve by himself .our society should not be made of people only good at repeating what they have heard , but of people who are creative , imaginative , original .the possibility offered by an university to learn and discover a whole range of new knowledge , is certainly one of the most important thing ever .it would be a shame to spoil this unique opportunity by being occupied with the learning of figures that would be forgotten almost immediately .anyway , recently , the priority has been given to the free will of the student .the curiosity and the knowledge of every students must be aimed at the improval of our society .understanding ideas and concepts may be compared to the keys which lead to the achievment of such a goal .
