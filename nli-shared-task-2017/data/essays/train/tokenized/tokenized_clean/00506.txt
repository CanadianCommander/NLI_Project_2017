there is a diversity of opinions over the issue of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinions .in my point of ivew , however , i fully agree with this position that most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they they really are for the following reasons .here are some reasons why .first of all , consumers ca nt deny that companies spend a lot money to broadcast their prodcuts .using pop stars or overstating their effects is one of their ways to sell their products .however , consumers never think about where these money come from and go .as a matter of fact , what consumers pay for what they buy going to the advertising because companies want to cousmers to buy their products .there are a lot of similar products in the markets .only one way making consumers to remembe and choose their products is to advertise .in addition , companies using advertisements tell people that how good their products are .in fact , people always feel upset because the products do nt satisafy them .take myself for a example , one time i bought a food , according to the advertisement , that could helf me to reduce my weight .needless to say , i spent a lot of money and time to try it .however , the outcome was making me pretty upset becuase it did nt work even thoug the company has guarantee about the effects .after this experience , i never believe what advertisements say .to sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisements .my personal experiences and actual observations of life have led me to conclusion that companies spend a lot of money to broadcast their products even though their products does nt seem much better than they really are .companies not only exagrrate the abilities of products , but also transfer the costs to the consumers .
