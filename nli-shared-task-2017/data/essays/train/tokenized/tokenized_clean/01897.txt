a person can enhance his academic knowledge in two ways .these are having a broad knowledge of many subjects and specializing in one specific subject .both of these ways have their own advantages and disadvantages .however , i think that having general information about different topics has more advantages compared to specializing in one specific subject .in one hand , knowing general things about many subjects may increase a student s overall perception of topics around .having a general perception of different subjects is also a way taken by ancient greek scientists .if we examine their life and researches , we find out that there is no scientist which just specialized and worked for a particular subject .with having broad knowledge about different topics , they have founded the main elements of our civilization .but in our world , people sometimes need specialized partners in order to accomplish a part of the project that was designed to be built simultaneously by different people who know their subject very well .on the other hand , specializing in one particular area may also increase a person s academic knowledge .specialized people are less prone to errors in their particular area than people who have general information about that particular area .however specializing have a negative effect on inventing new things .when somebody is specialized in one particular area , it is sometimes hard to find innovative things due to a lack of general knowledge about different subjects .the process of invention most of the time requires knowledge about different disciplines .the areas of science like biochemistry and electromechanics are great examples of these .in conclusion , i think having broad knowledge about different subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .it increases the ability to invent and helps to see the big picture more neatly where specializing produces identical people .
