i agree with this statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alredy know how to do well  .i support my answer by giving a simple example .consider the case of micheal faraday , the person responsible for todays electricity we are enjoying .if he thinks like a common man that the light we get from the candle is enough , we would not have enjoyed all the benifits we enjoying today to lead a comfortable and a peaceful life in this present it world .he started his assumptions that oppositely charged electrons can travel towards each and finally he struggled a lot and shown the world that electons can travel and enlightened us not only with the his theories but also with his innovations .without faraday there is no electricity today .he crossed all his way from the abuses of the critics to a person who has become a father of all electrical engineers and who made all the lives of the world comfortable today .so can you disagree with above statement after coming across faradays life ?is it not risky working with all the electrical elements as a play toy ?look at another example of yuri gaugarin , who is the first person to step on to the moon .is he not adventures by totally taking risk and going to the space which is a lot and lot of million kilometers away from the earth ?i think in this way he could easily recorded as a successful by taking risk of his life .i think by this example you can totally agree with above statement that `` successful persons takes risks to do innovative things .these people dont do the things what we do , they simple do things what they feel like doing and finally they are the people who leads the world .if you the example of a successful business techniques now adays they simple do advantures or take risks in introducing new innovative products that are likely to be welcomed by the customers .so i conclude by saying that now adays people welcome changes than the regular stuff we use everyday from the clothes we use to the eatables we use .so i feel like sussful people are in major proportions in people who do things in not a regular the others do .
