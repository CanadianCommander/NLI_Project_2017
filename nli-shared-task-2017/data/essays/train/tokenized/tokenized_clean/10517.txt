people do something because of very reasons such as compulsory , to be happy , however , something is not enough for some people ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already known how to do well .` i definitely agree with this term .i believe that succesful people believe themselves this is very important issue for me becuase if person believe yourself would not lose easy .firstly , many people are doing same job or things in the world and sometimes it can be boring for example many parents want to chose a specific job for their children like an engineer , a doctor , a lawyer .it can be normal but if people have to do this they can do another one .this should not a compulsory for life .for example person who was the fourty five years old and he is a doctor , suddenly he change your mind and want to be a captain .in this time i believe , this is success and he is successful .sometimes life can be bored our passion , ambitious are gone in this time some risks are taken to do better for own life .also we can be much more successful than past .secondly , try new things can be difficult for some people , but somethings are not known when they are not trying .maybe failures can be waiting to us , but it is not an important , if galio or ainstein did not try , today we do not know science as now .all the things i mentioned above , i completely agree with this term .successful people try new things they do not afraid , sometimes they take risks .however , others are always afraid or because of the some responsibilities such as family , children , they do not try .at the end success is not always coming with trying , but at least we would try and we would learn .
