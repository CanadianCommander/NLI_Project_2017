i do not agree with this opinion because of these three reasons ; expenses to have a tour guide , not being able to communicate with local residents , and not being able to learn taking resposobilities and the real side of the place .first , it is expensive to have a tour guide compared to taking a trip on your own or in a group .it is not nessesary to worry about the cost if the person is rich , however not very many people would like to speand too much money just on traveling because it is also important to spend money on souveniours or on the food .therefore it is not nessesary to have a tour guide .second , it is hard to communicate with local residents with a tour guide .when taking a trip , it is a great opportunity to talk to the local residents because they may be able to tell you where good restaurants are or nice places where local people only know .also , when traveling a foreign country , it is fun using a foreign language .if you are traveling with a tour guide and he or she always does things for you , you might lose these opportunities .third , the tour with a tour gude in a group can be fun with no learning and responsibilities .taking trips can be a learning place .you can learn about the people , culture , atomosphere , and the language where you visit .when you are with a tour guide , you will only listen to the tour guide and your friend in the group , therefore these learning opportunities decrease compared to taking trips without a tour guide .also you will be dependant on the tour gide so that you will not be able to learn as much as traveking alone .let s travel alone !you may be scared to travel alone , however there are so many things you can learn by taking trips on your own .it is cheap to take trips without a tour guide and fun to get to know the local residents .you will also be able to learn many things by traveling alone .again , i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
