advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in our twentieth century world , money is one of the biggest issues for most people .when companies create a product , they want to get to as many people as they can , so they use advertisements on television , magazines , and even the internet in orther to announce their product .since companies compete with each other to sell the most products , they have to show people how their products is the best .therefore , they use techniques that glorify their products so customers are persuated to buy them .one technique companies use are subliminal messages .in the commercials , the companies advertise their product close to something that makes people feel good , such as a nice beach , or a good looking female .when a person looks at the advertisement , he/she sees the product as better than it actually is , and is therefore persuated into buying the product .for example , victoria secret , the famous underwear brand for females , uses good looking women in their commercials to make other women think that this product will look as good on them .companies also over-advertise , so their product gets stuck on people s minds and when the time comes to make a decision in what to buy , the customer remembers the adverisement and buys the product .advertisements can also make products more appealing than they are by adding special effects .this technique is used specially on food products ; for example , chili s , the restaurant , does commercials on burgers and their food , where they put special paint and shiny effects , so that their food is seen as perfect .they sometimes even use fake artifacts to make their product seem better than it really is .in conclusion , companies want to advertise their products to the public in the best way possible to they associate their products with things that are not part of the product .they mislead customers into buying something that is ultimately worse than what the company advertised .
