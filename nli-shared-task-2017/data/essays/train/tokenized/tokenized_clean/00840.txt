having broad knowledge is always better than having specialization in one specific subject .but , this doesnot apply to every student .we can classify this for students based on their level of education in two categories .one is a undergraduate level student and the other is a graduate level student .for an undergraduate student , it is recommened to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .having so helps him to know what fileld he is his intrested in .he can choose the area of subject , in which he wants to specialize in graduation .moreover , any person should have minimun knowledge on different fileds .like if we take an engineer , if he does nt have minimun knowledge about human body , then he may face problems in his life .like he can not explain well enough to doctor like an illeterate , if there is any problem with his health .also important is some political and general information for students who comes from enginnering , medical or any other filed .any citizen of a county needs to know atleast some history about his country .he may be a big doctor , but if he doenot know how his country got indepence or who are the great leaders or atleast the geographical structure of his countrty .there is no point saying that , i am a medical student and i do nt require any history knowledge .he should have atleast some basic knowledge related to any field .where as in the case of a graduate student , it is better if he specializes in one subject .he needs to concentrate on one subject and specialize in it .most probaly , a graduate student , like one after completing his masters will go for a job .so , he needs to specialize in one specific subject , where he is dreaming to work .a doctor needs to specialize in one particular field , like an eye specialist or become a cardioligist by specializing in heart related problems .in short , we can say that a undergraduate level student needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects and a graduate level student can specialize in one specific subject .
