i agree with the idea that young people thesedays are reluctant to spend their time on participating community activities .there are two reasons for this : distance from their home town and lack of information .first , young people tend to live in urban areas apart from their original communities for the purpose of pursuing their study or works .since more reputed universities or jobs providing higher incomes are usually available only in cities , young people are more likely to choose to live in urban areas rather than to stay with their parents at rural areas .i am the case actually .i have been lived separately from my parents since i entered university which locates far from my home town at the age of 19 .since i have lived far away from my village , i could not manage to go back so frequently , and as a result , i have not been able to join any community activities since then .thus , the physical distance from their communities make young people impossible to spend their time on supporting their communities .secondly , young people feel that it is less necessary to support their communities because of the lack of information on present situation .this is closely related to the first point which i mentioned above .since they are living apart from their community , they scarcely have an opportunity to communicate with their neighbours and to know the present situation of their communities .because of the lack of communications , youths can not realize what kind of help their communities really need .therefore , young people become less concerned about problems happened in their communities .in conclusion , young people currently tends not to use their time to assist their communities , since they are living isolated from their community and there are rare chance for young people to know the actual situation in their communities .
