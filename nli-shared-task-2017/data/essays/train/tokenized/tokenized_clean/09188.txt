in our daily life facts has a domination on our automated behaviours .because most people do nt spend much time on intellectual activities .they are getting up early , having breakfast , going to work , after their work they coming to home back and this loop goes on .but if a person must want to be a real human , he/she must spent some time in the world of ideas , because what makes it different from animals .before a fact became a fact it first be shaped in our mind .after creating an idea we can give it life and make it real .we put some goals in our brain , for example going to mars after 20 years .is this a fact ?of course not .but going to the moon was not a fact too until someone deciding to achive this challenging idea .so if we want to do something we must start from conceptualization of what we want to do .another fact about facts is they are passive for us .it is a result of a proccess and what shapes the proccess is ideas .so we can say that thinking is cause and fact is result .in this point of view , if we want to educate creative and active students we must not fill their brains with passive facts , instead we must teach them how to think and conceptualize new , brave and challenging ideas .in sum , being as a human we are living both with ideas and facts .but teaching only facts without their background information can not achieve a permanent learning on student .and a student who does not know how to create new concepts has no meaing in education .
