i fully agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is for them to learn facts .of course , facts are important .it is essential to know certain basic facts in almost all fields of study : for instance , a literature student must know about the main epoques of literature through the centuries , a science student must know certain formulae by heart .yet a knowledge of facts that goes beyond these basics is not as important as having understood the underlying ideas and concepts .facts may be changing .new styles of literature will develop , new engineering techniques will evolve .yet the main concepts underlying these new developments will not change .they can still be applied , be it in an academic environment when writing an essay or sitting an exam or be it in the workplace when new methods or production techniques will have to be understood and assessed .i am a lawyer and therefore know very well that no scenario resembles the other .every case differs from the other , at least in nuances .therefore , in order to be able to find a solution to a case , one must have understood the rationales behind legal doctrines .only then will one be able to apply a doctrine to an unnknown set of facts .moreover , facts can be looked up in books or are available online .facts can also be digested fairly easily .they may be complex , but they are hardly ever incomprehensible .on the contrary , concepts can not easily be looked up in a book .they are often hard to understand .they will often need explanation and in-depth reading .that is why we actually study them , often for years .this is why attend universities .understanding concepts and ideas is the key to organising the myriads of facts there are .human knowledge has multiplied over the past decades .facts are readily available over the internet .therefore i believe that it is even more important to understand ideas and concepts nowadays than it was 50 years ago .otherwise we are running the risk of being inundated with facts not knowing how to handle them .it is for these reasons that i am convinced that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important for students than to learn facts .
