i do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to help their communities .this is a relative statement and like all relative statement , it is bugged with contextual inconsistencies .when comparing two time periods from a perspective of societal contribution by young people , we need to understand that the challenges and expectations var widely and thus the statement ca nt be empirically justified .moreover , the current society is a result of the action of past and to blame it implies that the values enshrined by the societies of the past were not that great , thus challenging the underlying process on which the statement is made .just like organisms , society also evolves .as such it has become bigger , more varied , adaptable and faster .the value system it espouses is radically different from the past and thus are the actions .to compare the actions of young people in the current socitey from the value lenses of the past society is doing great injustice .the current young generation is expected to perform well in all sphere of life , be it a home , school , college , work , friend circle , society .this is putting a lot of pressure considering that the time needed to perform all this activities has not increased .such was nt the case in previous socities .despite that , the young people are very motivated and concerened about the scocety and it s well being .this is visible if you look at most of the socially oriented organizations are staffed by young people , be it peta , greenpeace etc .there are a lot of demonstrations around the world to stop the ravages of wars that drive their force from the youth of today .the younger generation is looking at novel ways of making a change .the new breed of social entrepreneurs are forming non profit companies that are run in a professional ways to contribute to the betterment of society .this can be ascertained by the fact that there has been a mushrooming of social oriented business courses all across .the work places are providing outlets for their younger employees to engage in socially relevant tasks , besides their normal tasks and they are lapping it up .the younger generation , in my opinion is more awakened and sensitive about the needs of the society .they are doing all their very best to fulfill the social duty in a more efficient and effective ways .the only difference being that the areas which concern them are different from that of the previous societies , which reflect the challneges of the present and not the past .
