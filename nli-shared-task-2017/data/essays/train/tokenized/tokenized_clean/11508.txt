personally , i agree with the statement that the number of cars would probably decrease in the future , as the contemporary situation already provides hints that the trend is going towards this direction .first of all , the recent development of the gas price , shows that driving a car becomes more and more expensive .even today more and more people try to avoid to use their if it is not necessary .moreover , already today there are people who ca nt afford having a car .i think that it is very likely that this trend will continue in the future .consequently it seems sensitive , as having a car becomes more and more expensive , that even the number of cars might decrease .moreover , cars cause pollution .people are already aware that it is detrimental to the environment and thus in consequence also to health if the traffic is not reduced .campaigns try to raise the awareness something has to change .thus i can imagine that measures have to be taken to reduce the traffic .one of the simplest is to reduce the number of cars .governments must and will have to take action , hence it appears reasonable that they will try anything to obtain a reduction of the number of cars .one possibility to reduce the number of cars might be to raise the taxes which would in the end also make driving expensive , so that people might no use more public transports .however , i can also imagine that as there is a need to reduce the number of cars in order to protect the environment , the costs for public transports might be lowered thereby encouraging more and more people to avoid buying a car .this trend can already be observed in the big cities .car sharing and a stronger use of public transports such as subway and buses have become common hints that the number of cars is decreasing .however , although i believe that the number of cars will decrease in the future , it is also possible that this does not happen .a new technology based on regenerable resources that makes cars less dangerous for the environment may keep the number of cars stable .we will see
