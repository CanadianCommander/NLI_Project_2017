i personally agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time in helping their communities .i for one feel that i myself do not spent enough time helping others .many young people has already forgotten about their communities , forgotten that that are other people besides themselves , forgotte that the community needs their help and is more than happy to receive a helping hand from them .many young people nowadays are more self absorbed than back then .they have learned to be more self driven to their own goal regardless of the sacrifices and so on .they learned about individuality and competition .they do not realize the importance of helping their communities .although there are many public awareness campaign on this issue but it is not enough to drive the young people to help their communties .most of the young people are more concerned with social status than anything else these days .they are preoccupied with being popular than to see what the communities need .they see community service as a task or chore or a boring thing to do rather than a healthy and honorable action .they do not picture this as a cool thing to do and it is probably not on their prioirity list .they do not see the bigger picture of the society and that others may need a helping hand .young people nowadays also has much more source of entertainment , for example there is the wide usage of the computer these days .most young people spend most of their time on the computer .they are surfing the internet for information , they are using the computer to communicate with others , to play games as well as to obtain other source of entertainment .other source of entertainment such as shopping malls , coffee joints , clubs and bars have more appeal to the young people nowadays rather than helping the community .due to the time spent on electroninc gadgets such as computers , and entertaining themselves with other activities such as going out with friends to malls and so on , young people have limited free time to help put their communities .they forget the traditional ways of communicating and helping their communities .in conclusion , the priorities of young people nowadays has changed .they tend to forget to put in helping others as one of their priorities as they are very much goal oriented , individualized and have many source of entertainment these days .hopefully the young people will one day realize this and change their behaviors .
