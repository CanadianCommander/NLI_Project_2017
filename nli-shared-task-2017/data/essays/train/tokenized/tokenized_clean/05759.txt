i personally do nt agree that we have fewer cars in use than tuday in twenty years .my reasons are as follows .first , i can stete about population in future , especially in developing countries .the population have growed up greatly and their standard of living have been becoming higher little by little .furthermore , most of them strongly want to get their own cars .actually when last month i visited east africa , kenya and uganda this summer , i was so surprised that more and more people become to have cars and even if they ca nt buy now they strongly want their cars .how can they resist their hope of cars to do their business and enjoy driving and traveling otherwise their cars proveid ?second , price of car will decrease more and more because many companies have been providing a large number of cars and we have many used cars and export them from developed countries to developing countries .so people will able to buy a new and used cars more easily .therefore , as i mentioned above , i difinitedly think that we will have more cars in twenty years as near future .
