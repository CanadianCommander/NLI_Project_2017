if we stay on country , we do nt know what s going on in the world .like this , to make successes in our life , we have to try many things as much as we can .by trying someting new , we can get new knowledges that we did nt know before .and it wil be background informations when we decide or do someting new .i understand that to advent new field has risks to fail .becuase we do nt know about that at all .but next time this field wo nt new to you .it wil be widoms .personally , the decision for go to american was huge adventrue to me .it was hard becuase i knew that if i go to american , i have to do everything by myself , and there is no family and friend .instead of that i got english skills and mental growth .because i tried new one , i could get precious experiences .during the adventure , by facing hard reality and undergoing tough conditions , we will grow and become to adult .many experiences provide you manifestations of your decisions .you will know what is correct and wrong among your experiences .the fact that successful people intend that try new things and take risks is ture .when we reading articles and watching shows about famous people , we realize that their lifes were not easy .they underwent so many frustrations , hopelessnesses , and destructions of hope .but i got victories from them by doing constant adventure , today they are repected from people .life is not long and in the world , there are so many things that we can learn and get .trying something new in the world is not something that ca nt get though .that s why i called trying new things as adventure .i am feeling that i have pleniful time in my life and i am keeping fighting with new field that i dind nt know before .so that i can prove my life was seqences of adventure and finally i got successes .
