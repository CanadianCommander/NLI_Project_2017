i agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they are .but i am not upset by this since the first goal of an advertisement is to make people like and buy the products .in my opinion , the real problem is that alot of people believe that some of these advertisements tell the truth and that is why we should provide some clear and objective information about the products in other to keep the consumers informed .it would be really hypocritical to say that advertisement does not li .since its goal is to make the consumer purchase a product then it is logical to only tell the advantages of the products and not their drawbacks .for example imagine an advertisement that shows a car .if it says ` this car generates a lot pollution and uses a lot of oil  , nobody will buy the car .but if it says ` this car if one of the fastest one and is extremely confortable  , then a lot of men who likes speed will buy it .that why it may be logical to make a product look as good as you can if you want to sell it .nevertheless the problem is that consummers have to be aware that advertisements do not always tell the truth .the key point is that they do nt provide a part of the information .that is why i think that it should exist some independent companies which goal is to compare the products and provide some objective information about them .for example we could imagine a study that compares all cars with the same criteria and would say about the car of my first paragraph : ` ok , this car goes fast and is very confortable but it is not ecolocical at all and you will moreover need a lot of gas which is expensive !.thus , the men who like speed but are concerned with ecology would maybe buy an other one .as a conclusion , i think that advertisement will always make products seem much better than they really are .in my opinion , the real problem is that consummers should be aware of the real caracteristics of each product and that is why the role of independant organisations that keep the consummers informed are very important .
