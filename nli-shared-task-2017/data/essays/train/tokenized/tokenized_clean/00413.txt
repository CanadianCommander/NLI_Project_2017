there are many ways that the topic of the better way to gain knowledge can be approached .some people think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better , while others do not .i have my point of view as well .there are two reasons why i am in favor of having broad knowledge .a key reason underlying my choice is that if we study broadly , we can be more competitive in the future .take my brother , for example .while he was studying during university , he decided to have english teaching for his minor .although he lost a lot of time hanging out with friends , he got more choices when he graduated from the university .moreover , because of his ability of english speaking and his major , marketing , he got promoted quickly .such an example shows that studying broadly can help us become more competitive .another important reason why i choose studying broadly is that sometimes , we wo nt be so sure about what we are going to do in the future .if we studying broadly , we can find out our real interests from all these subjects and choose the one we want .take my father , for example .when he was in college , he majored in history .as a matter of fact , it would be hard to find a job except being a teacher .unfortunately , my father does nt like to teach at all .however , he took more classes in other departments , and try to choose one subject that he really likes .finally , he choosed chinese and he became an editor in a big newspaper company in my country .without broad knowledge , my father may not be such successful today .of course , there is an argument to be made for other posotions .nevertheless , i think the reasons that i have presented are stronger .
