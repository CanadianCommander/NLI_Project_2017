i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take new risks . ..i firmly believe that ` success is a journey , not a destination  .if one spends his entire life doing what he already know show to do well , he is not exploring new avenues and hence , will never know what life has to offer .a few examples to support my view are as follows .the first one is a story of a little boy who , out of curiosity and vision turned around his life .once , dejected and depressed about things not working with his computer , he put thought into why that might be and tried out a ` new way  to make things work .today , the world knows the man by bill gates , one of the richest people and creator of microsoft .a lot of great inventions come by accident and one needs to open one s mind to trying new things in order to run into accidents .another example is the popular 3m company which manufactures post-it .while trying a `` new way  to make a glue that sticks so well that it never comes off , a failure to do so , led to the invention of post it notes which are popularly used world-wide today .taking risks exposes a person to failures and makes him a stronger individual , a trait that ironically is the essence of success .i conclude with a few lines from the famous poem if written by rudyard kipling - `` if you can make a heap of all your winnings , and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss , and lose , and start at the beginning , and never breathe a word about your loss  ...then `` yours is the world and everything that s in it , and which is more , you will be a man , my son  .
