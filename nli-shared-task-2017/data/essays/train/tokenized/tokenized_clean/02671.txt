i disagree with the statement showing `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts  .for example , why do all of us deeply study about history ?this is because the knowledge of facts which happened in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the future .there is a famous japanese sentence shown as `` open your future by learning from the past  .this exactly explains why it is important to learn facts .furthermore , i think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past .for instance , the idea to launch the united union , involving all nations in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflicts by preventing war , was created after the big event , the 2nd world war .after learning that this kind of war means nothing to whole of the world and all of the population , the genius leaders had reached to this idea .therefore , i think that it is also very important for students to learn facts as much as understanding ideas and concepts .
