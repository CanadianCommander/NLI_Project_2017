with the advance of communication systems such as television and internet , access to information is becoming easier and easier .therefore , it is not hard these days to find people with a little knowledge on a wide range of subjects .access to information has become easier not only for ten-year-old children but also for scientists as well .however , it is not the range of subjects one has knowledge on , but the depth of knowledge in a specific subject , when it comes to academics .the reason is many fold .first of all , good academic work requires concentration , hard work , and above all , deep knowledge on the subject .it is of course true that having knowledge on many other subjects would help the researcher look at the subject , or the problem at hand from other points of view , but when it comes to actually producing good work , all that matters is expertize on the subject .simply , one can not produce original academic work without understanding the small details of the subject ; be it the inner workings of a physical principle , or the french cuisine in middle class of the seventeenth century .another crucial reason as to one should specialize on the subject she is working on , rather than spending her time learning about other subjects is that in the end , one will have to convey his knowledge to the next generation .as this is the only way knowledge is accumulated , by passing from generation to generation , a researcher should always have a good understanding of the new discoveries in his field , which will require specializing on the subject .only after having a deep knowledge on the subject can one let the next generation benefit from his background .having superficial knowledge about a broad range of subjects is like reading the first pages of thousands of books , hence does not contribute to one s wisdom or expertise .compare that to someone who has only read hemingway s ` for whom the bell tolls  .it is not unreasonable at all to argue that the latter has gained a better wisdom from her experience .
