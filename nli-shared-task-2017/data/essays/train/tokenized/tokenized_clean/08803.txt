during the ` 70s vance packard sustained that advertisements is fake , is something that persuades every single customer and make him/her buy a product even if he/she does nt need it or is not interested in .anyway we have to highlight the date written above : we are talking about the 70s , far and far away and moreover we have to consider the critical economical situation of that time .that s way i firmly disagree with the ones who think like packard did .just few people study advertising and its world and that s the reason why they do nt know how advertising works in reality .it works just because many studies have been done from different disciplines like pscichology or sociology to understand the customer deeper .the customers knowledge help people , who have to communicate a product or an idea , to reach the target needs and desires .nothing more .there is a new customer in the society , someone who just buy what he/she need or really want , is an active person who doesn  let the advertisement decide for him/her .the buyier has become more critical to this kind of communication and more to the one broadcast through television .it  s also important to keep in mind that this job has strict rules and a deontological ethic like other professions .subliminal advertisement is not allowed at all , it s consider illegal in most of the countries .even if i appreciate advertisement , i have to say that sometimes some companies try to make the product more interesting to us but than ialso have to remind that we still have a great power of decision making .if only people known how advertisement really works , i m sure they will appreciate as i do .it s not as dangerous as is thought .everything still depends on us .you can buy something only if you want to .
