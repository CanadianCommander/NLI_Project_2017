the question being asked is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to rather specialize in one specific subject .in my eyes this question brings up a very important issue in times of increasing interdisciplinary work .many companies want their emloyees to work trans - or interdisciplinary and i personally think for this it is necessary to specialize in one specific subject .first of all , concerning the fact that human knowledge increases so fast nowadays i think it is almost impossible to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects such as leibnitz did for example .of course , a person can still have a good general education and can be interested in many things , but when it comes to knowing a lot about academic issues there is a limit .second i feel that only people who spezialize in a certain field will be able to find a good job in our society .especially in science it is necessary to have experts who know almost everything about their subject .because only those people will be able to get so deep into the topic that they will eventually find new solutions to problems .and for getting so deep into the subject i am sure that it is crucial to focus and to specialize in one specific topic .naturally it is important to work together with people of different academic fields , as it is wanted by interdisciplinarity strategies , but that does not mean that everyone has to everything .in my eyes the best solutions for current problems will be found when many experts will come together on one table and exchange ideas .so , in conclusion i feel that nowadays it is just not possible to have such a wide range of knowledge and as a matter of fact i think that it is not necessary if people of different subjects start working together .
