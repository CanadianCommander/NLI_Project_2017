every one try to look for enjoyment in his/her life .enjoyment in life is not easy to earned , and it requiers several things .in my own opinion , there are two important requirements to enjoy in your life such as , huge experience , and have your own money .furthermore , those requirements we can found in older people .so , i disagree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people  .first of all , older people have more experience than young people .also , if you have alot of experience you will be able to choose the good and more benefit things for you to enjoy .forexample , traveling bring enjoyments when it is empty from the dangerouse things , and to be away from hazardness , you have to have enogh experience .experience is really protect you from dangerous thinga and from hazardness .then , older people depend on themselves , and they have their own money .so they will be able to know how , where , and when to use and spend their money .also , they will be able to save money for their needs , and they will be aware from loans .in the conclusion , older people are more awake , and they can earn their right and exact enjoyment in their life .moreover , i think it is really important to advice our children about getting the right and good enjoyment in our fabulouse life .enjoyment is diffecult to earned .
