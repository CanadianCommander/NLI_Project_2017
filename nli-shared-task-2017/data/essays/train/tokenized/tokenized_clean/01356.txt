the realm of ages bettween people have always fascinated me .thinking on how and when we enjoy life is interestign and difficult too .i do not agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .for as long as a remember , i used to enjoy life when i was fourteen the same way i do now .i mean , the years pass by , and time goes on , but we still being enjoing it in different ways .must of this depens on how we see life and what are we expecting four it .for example some weeks ago , i was talking with my grandfather about his early years in college .he told about his affairs and adventures during that time , but later the talk came deep and he talked me about his present .he told me about how his fighting against cancer , and how tha make him feel , how hard he is triying to keep waking up each day .i was hearing him , not feeling comfotableand with the situation and intrigated with his future .but suddenly , he reach my hand and told me how fascinated he was with bad times too .he told me how bad situations can help us enjoy good ones , son every partor age is enjoylable .today , after that talk with the old man , i knew we all enjoy life the same way , even we are younguer or older .all depends on how we aprroach to it and built it .so , finally i just can say that im hoping to know tomorrow , how was that i enjoyed life in all different ways .and keep specting the good things and the bad things to happen for me and the others , but taking them a the best way i could .
