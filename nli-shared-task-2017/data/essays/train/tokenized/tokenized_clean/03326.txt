nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree with this statement .i will argue my viewpoint by giving example and explained the importance of the community .it true that not all the young now dont give enough time for their communities but other youngs have a particular devotion for their communities .for my view , the a large number of youngs are individuals .nowadays peoples in general and youngs particularly focus on individual success .for example life go fast and has become very difficult that youngs have to work hard .there are only face to new individual challenge in order to satisfy their need and there familly .for example me , i know that i could help my communities with my academic experience , but it more important for me to find a job , to work hard to keep my job , to be married , to have a children and to take care of them .it only after that , that i will think about how to help my community .therefore it very important to think about the community .the question is how to help my community ?by giving my viewpoint on some importante subject , contribute for school bulding , by undertaking research project in order to develop my community etc .so i would like to advise young to pay attention for the community , even if there not interested to participate for the development there are to take care by not destroying what the community has built .i would also like old people to understand the young because now life if more difficult than before to focus on many thinks at the same time .
