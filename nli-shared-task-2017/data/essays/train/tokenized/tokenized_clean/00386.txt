most of people buy the material by watching a television comercials .however , when the good was very different from the commercial , we waste the time and money after buying it .i sometimes feel some of advertisments are nt genuin materials which are couting something else , different color , or kind of immitations .there are some photograpohers who take a picture about the commercial materials .so , they are couting something on a genuine food when he want to take a picture .i could nt eat some foods without hearing the ture .moreover , the american restaurant in the united states looked very deliciously , but actually i feel bad taste .i like to going to the shopping when i want to buy some clothes which i getting to be a favorite one .the color of clothe is definitely important .in japan , there are diverse colors and it s very difficult to make these color , thus i want to get it with japanese color .however , my favorite clothe are different of color .i claimed these materials to shop staff .but they just talked about the photographer is mistook to make the catalogue .when i buy the car , i always look the advertisement which are listed a lot of them .if i felt this car is cool as well as expensive one , i try to buy it .however , it s totally different from list .because advertising-maker used the immitation materials when he makes the catalog .in the concludion , many advertising are so different from the genuine thing .we should take care about these truths .whenever we buy something , we should check it on our foot before buying something via the internet or telephone order .we had better to hear the oral communication with genuine experienve about the materials .
