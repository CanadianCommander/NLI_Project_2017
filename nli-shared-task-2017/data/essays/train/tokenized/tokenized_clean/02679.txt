i am absolutely certain that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in fact , it is the motivation of the people who are creating the advertisement to influence the people and create a perfect image of a certain product .i will give two reasons and examples to underline my opinion .the first point i would like to make is about tv spots and their style of influence .by making a nice spot it is possible to present a certain product in the way the producer wants to .some time ago , for example , i saw an advertisement about a tooth paste with a whitening effect .in the spot a beautiful woman , titled as the wife of a dentist , told me about her experiences with this tooth paste .i could see her wonderful white teeth and was very impressed .next day i bought this tooth paste and hoped to get more white teeth as soon as possible .unfortunately , yet my teeth have not change into a more white colour and i guess i was influenced by this spot , which made the tooth paste better than it actually is .secondly , i would like to refer to prospects about hotels .to present a product nicely , photos can be sufficient , too .i suppose , almost everybody once has read such a prospect and was impressed about all the nice photos .on the photos , every lobby is modern and friendly , the swimming pools seem to be very big and the rooms are with balconies , plants , nice sofas and chairs .however , these photos mostly only show the best parts of the hotels .of course , they do not present a complete impression , including the more unrepresentative parts .thus , these prospects create an impression of the hotels which presents them better than they really are .as a conclusion i would like to underline that advertisements are not forced to show the truth .it is obvious , that the producers of advertisements take this chance to influence the peoples impression of certain products .
