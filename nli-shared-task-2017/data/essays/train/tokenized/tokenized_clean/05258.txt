since their first appearance on the market , cars had gone through an outstanding increase concerning their rate of production .it is starting from this idea that i do not agree with the statement .in fact , looking back at history an evident growth of cars production can be seen , together with a rapid development of competition between the cars industries that are also forced to follow people s needs .first of all , since their first production during the 1920 s ( with tom ford ) , cars have gradually gained an even bigger role in society .their introduction into people s lives started to completely revolutionize their everyday lives and their standards .people obtained the possibility of moving throughout their country and to become more independent .since then , cars have become part of our lives , even influencing our deicisions and our plans .it is for this reason that today s cars production has more than doubled its sells and it is still continuing to do so .secondly , i do not agree with the statemetn because competition among industries producing cars is pushing their production to augment instead of decreasing it .in today  s society it is fundamental to invest and make money , therefore competition between industries is reaching really high levels .it is due to this increasing competition and rivalry that cars production is not going to stop and not even to slow down .finally , cars producers are also following people s need in society and , since our requests and needs are increasing and changing as time goes by , the production of cars is following our demands .people from all over the world need such a fundamental mean of transportation in order to travel , work and fullfill their own goals .when industries decide to sell a product , they first refer themselves to society s and people s needs and since cars are even more present and necessary to us , their production is continuing to proceed in a positive way .these three points are the reason why i do not agree with the statement .not only i base myself on historical evidence , but i also analyse the influence people s needs have and the companies  interest in producing something which is worth selling .
