generally for all the students its very important to understand a lot of things .it can be inferred that are a lot of ways of how a student can understand , that are learning from ideas and concepts , or understand by facts .there are a lot of disadvantages of the three kind of situations already mentioned .for example understanding by ideas it means that they do nt have the main experience to make straight the definiton and it s more usually , difficult to understand it by this way .for the other hand students can also understand by concepts , this means that the students are going to learn from a definition , something more concret .and also there is another way of how a student can learn , and this way is understanding by facts , it means that the student is not going to learn a concept or have the main idea , it s that the student is going to experience and learn from something that he lived .these types of how a student can understand things can be something unclearness , but it doe nt mean that each student use the three options to learn something , but eventhough there are some of them who really uses the three .for the other hand there a some students that only prefer one option , because they think that its the best way for them to understand things .for my conclution i would say that it s more important to all the students learn by facts , because it s not the same thing to say that each person understood by reading and having the main concept of things , or that having just the idea .also , i think that it would be more clearfull to understand things by facts , because the students will not only get a good understanding , they also are going experience about a lot of things and that is going to be somenthing usefull for their life .
