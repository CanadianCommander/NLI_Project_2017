yes this is a statement what is usually expressed by persons of the older generation !i generally disagree with the statement that the young generation do not help there communities .ok there might be some cases were young people have a little bit forgotten there community .but if you look at the bigger picture this is not the case .young people are very much engaged in ther social surrounding and they are trying to help where they can .maybe the view discribed in the statement has occured because of differing standpoints .persons of older generations may have a different definition of what your community is .today in a globalized world the community has broarded a lot .possibly your community can exist on many diffent places .if you help then in your community it might not be obvirus to a person who looks just on one spot .i believe that all these young people who leave there country to help in a country of the third world consider this place far away from home also as there community .another thing what makes it today more difficult to measure the amount of help you offer to your community is the factor that it is more common to help or e.g. to do some social work in your community .in the past e.g. environmental protection was a quite new experience for the society as a whole .therefore persons who fought for environmental protection in there community might have been much more visible for others .today such things are normal and everybody expects them to be there .meaning that persons who believe that young people do not help in there community should redirect there focus to the changed world of today .ok there still is one point to consider .today competition in education is much bigger than in the past .therefore it could happen that some young persons are simply to busy to help in there community .but generally this is not the case .
