i do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .it is getting more and more affordable , even for younger people who have just gotten their driver s licence , to own a car .so there are much more , rather young people driving than in the past and i do not think that this will change .so this is a constant in my considerations .not only that more young people possess cars , also people that are older will still be driving when they are at the age of 75 or 80 , because people become older but will stay mentally and psychologically fit even in higher ages and will not give up on driving since it will - in twenty years like nowadays - be important for humans to be flexible and be able to move wherever and whenever you want to .regardless of high car-densities that can already been found today , people will not give up on their cars because they have gotten used to the convenience of driving .some sort of exploring-mentality will force human beings to even drive further than today .with new car technology that will probably been found in twenty years that should not be a problem .another important fact in this consideration is the role of countries like china and india .they are about to step up as progressive states in which industrialization takes place .of course there will be high demands of cars in the upcoming years .with its billions of people these two countries will have a tremendous impact on the usage of cars in the future .more and more people there will be able to finance a car and - with the course of industrialization - will buy one .under these circumstances it will be important to find new solutions for avoiding high-traffic in urban areas and pollution of the environment .
