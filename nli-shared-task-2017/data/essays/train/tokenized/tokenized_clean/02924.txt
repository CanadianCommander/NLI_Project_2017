it is said that `` knowledge is power  .but i believe that knowledge is power if it is used in an efficient way .we acquire knowledge on different subjects around us .but most of us get interested in a particular subject and try to learn more about that .i prefer to say that it is better to have broad knowledge on many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i feel so because with broad knowledge of many subjects we can become multiskilled .having broad knowledge of many subjects is always helpful .every science we deal is related to other sciences .even the technologies that are getting developed now a days are also demanding knowledge of other subjects to cope with the situations .for example an electronics student need to have knowledge of computer , to analyze and make his work easy on chip design .the world around us is made of many things which are related to physics , biology , mathematics and many other subjects .if we focus on a particular subject and leave others it will be difficult for us when we may suddenly have to face a situation that needs knowledge of other subjects other than our subject of specialization .for example one of my friend specialized in botany , he doesnot know anything about electricity .he once kept his hand in bucket of water in which a heating water coil was placed and when power was passing .he got a sudden shock because of that and he took two days to recover from that experience .when i asked him about this , he was saying he was not aware of the fact that he will get shock if he places his hand in bucket containing water heater .he is very good at botany , but this didnot help him out , to face the situation that dealt with electricity .finally considering all these issues and examples , i prefer to say broad knowledge of subjects is needed .ofcourse specialization in particular subject gives us a proper career , makes us learn deeply and have good knowledge of that subjectbut broad knowledge of subjects helps us to live in the society comfortably which is even more important .
