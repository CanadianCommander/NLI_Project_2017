i agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , and i will say some words explaining why to be a young person is more an attitude than a period of our life .it is easily to find evidence about the enjoyment of life of young people .they are active , they look for new experiences and they talk a lot about them with their friends .what is more , young people probabily take more risks when they take decisions , than older people do .on the other hand , it is very common that old people prefere to be involved in a rutine .it is hard for them to change their habits , and they are not looking for doing new things as often as a young people do .the image of an old people is someone that moves slowly , some of them have bad humor and they critize young people , because of their music , their way of dancing o their fashion .there is an opposse attitude towards life .young people want to enjoy life , be happy , try new things , and some old people want to survive and do not take risks .the activity , the strenght and the happiness of young people are the proof of their enjoyment of the life , and in my opinion , these characteristics can belong to an attitude more than an age .old people can enjoy the life , of course , but only with an young attitude .if they feel sad o depressed it is not possible enjoy the wonderful opportunities that the life offers .the same could happen to any young person .in my conclusion , any person can enjoy life if he or she is young in his o her mind .the activity should be appropiate to each age , m but
