as an italian citizen working and living within an american environment , after reading your question whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts , the first thing that came to my mind was the difference in the teaching and learning principles that i could identify between the italian and the american systems .until recently , the italian education system has been focused and built on the importance of theory on practice , to the point of delivering highly educated graduate students that due to the poor or complete lack of practice , experienced a very tough time once out in the work market , trying to get a job .on the other hand , what i have seen of the u.s. education system tells me that it is centered more on letting the students learn from facts than from theory .personal experience : my husband is a computer network engineer and i recall his first computer network college book including several chapters explaining the mathematical and physical principles related to issues like band-width and associated data transmission speed .well , knowning that unfortunately my husband has a very poor math and physics background , i asked him how come he ended up getting an a to that class and his answer was really astonishing for me italian student , used to the italian education system .basically , my husband told me that their teacher simply told them to skip all the math/physics chapters , because they really did nt need to know why things happened in a certain way , but just the way they worked .hopefully , i am sure that not all u.s. college teachers are like the one above that was teaching computer networks to my husband and most likely his case represents just an extreme .nonetheless , i do deem that a little more attention to theory may benefit the u.s. education system , just like more practice would benefit the italian one .basically , in my opinion , `` understanding ideas and concepts  and `` learning facts  should be considered as factors equally important to students .actually , to me the ideal education system should contemplate an equal distribution of either learning systems .in conclusion , to me the appropriately educated person is the one that knows not only how things happen ( learning facts ) , but also why the world runs the way it does ( understanding ideas and concepts ) .
