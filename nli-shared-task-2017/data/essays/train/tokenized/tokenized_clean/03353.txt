i disagree with that statement .because i do nt believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .because the population of world continuosly growing up , its meanthere will be living more people on the earth than today .so its mean peoples will need more car for their requests or anything else whatever you want to call .if we look to back , our past will show us , we are always usig more by time .for example , if we use 10,000 cars in the 1920 s , we are using over than 500 million cars today .this is only one example shows , there is always a good table showing us we always use more car than last year .and its will be going up like this way .lets look with a different point .there are car facilities and others like tear productors etc .so always , they will need to be developing new models of car and other parts .and we are drivers or whatever we call , shortly peoples will be changing their cars to another new car .in this while other poor peoples , i mean who does nt lives in good life standarts or conditions .then as you seen there will be two car in use , if you will think other peoples does same too , so can you tell me , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?no there wo nt be fewer cars in use in the future .if you look around and think that , when you were child there was less car , but when you were growng up , if you think carefuly then you will see that cars are raising with time .now look around , how many car there are ?is it was less than the time you were child ?no it s not .because there are more cars in use now than past times .finally i will say we will see many car in use in the sooner future .if we do nt find solutions for traffic problems , so we will be in big trouble .we will waste time in traffic and we will waste gas for nothing while waiting at traffic .also i think patrol companies wo nt let it be less car .because how many car is there , they will sell that much gas and earn money .we can give many example like these .hopefully there wo nt be much cars than today for more healthfull live .but my brain does nt tells same things .i think we need to work hard for this big problem .we need to teach peoples for social transport vehicles like bus and others .for a healty life we also need to use byscle .i will say again , i do nt want a world with aot of car .i just want a world in peace and clear and healty and without stress .
