i strongly opine with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .if you visit a new place , it is always better to consult a guide since we will be ignorant about the historical information .there are lots of benefits when you have a travel guide around .the guides will have vast amount of information regarding the place .for example , they could give you historical significance of the place or any other important reasons for the fame of a particular place .it would be of no point in visiting places when you are completely unaware of its significance .and also , the guides will have vast knowledge about the places around so that we will not miss any of them and repent later .it is also convinient to interact with people when guides are around .there could be huge linguistic difference and also cultural difference .also , there are all possibilities of getting cheated by people when you are a foreigner .usuaully , the guides are multilingual and hence there are no chances of getting cheated .in india , a south asian country , there are many historical places famous for its magnificient architecture .there are stories depicting their significane .it would be of no point if we look at the work without any knowledge about it .it would merely be a piece of work .but instead if we know the story behind its significance , we will be in a position to appreciate the work .i could give a good example to support this point .one of my friends had been to a historical place in india .when she returned , she told me her experiences and the work she saw .she did not feel anything special about it .i then , explained the significance of the place .it was then she really appreciated it and felt that she should have known it then .she then appreciated the culture and did further research on the topic and the culture .hence , i feel that it is always better to have sufficient knowledge while visiting any place .
