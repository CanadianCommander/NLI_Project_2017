young people are less helping their communities than before .that is a fact , they do not spend enough time helping .in my opinion that is a sad fact and their are two major reason from this .nowadays , we live in a selfish socity where capitalism is taking the biggest role .i talk about capitalism because in my opinion it is not only an economic fact but it is also a social one .for instance , the games that my 17 years old brother play are much more different that the ones i used to play when i was younger .he plays video games that are in my opinion `` selfish  .in those games he plays by himself most of the time .so there is no socialisation with other young people .this fact does not teach how to share things with others and specially how to help because they teach that helping others is a weakness .people are independent younger than before .they do not rely on their parents for a long time as before .most of the 16 years old children dream of leaving home and having their own appartment .in my culture , the moroccan one , familly is really important .but i see that young people are loosing this value more and more .they tend to leave their parents , the `` first community  the have been in .they are selfish and they do not like to share things and help others .we are actually fasting for ramadan .during this special occasion , all the familly comes together and everyone have to prepare something to eat for instance .braking the fast have always been something that we all live together .but those last years , i see that my younger cousines does not want to share it with us .it s more an obligation for them than a happy event to share all together .it emerges from this discussion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help and be with their communities .that is an awefull fact but that is the truth .
