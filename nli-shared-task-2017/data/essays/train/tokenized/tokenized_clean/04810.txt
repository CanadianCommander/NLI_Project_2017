about the statement , some people may agree that , but others may have negitive attitudes .as far as i am concerned , i agree that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communutues .afterward , i will develop my opinions in sufficient depth and details .first of all , the transpotations are so convenient and developing today .people , inculding youngs , go to everywhere so easily , their appearences are not limited in the communities .when young people step out the door of houses , they can take buses , taxi , or subways , even drive cars by themselves and go to the place they want to .they even never pay attention to the communities they live in .how to talk about helping their communities .moreover , the social security today becomes worse and worse .no one can warrant that it s always safe in the communities .it s possible that the bad bad guys are our neighborhoods .besides young people , all people may have no confidence about the communities they live in .no one is willing to behavior friendly to the communities with no confidence .last , there are too many attractive things today for young people , like internet , pubs , movies , vedio games , etc .so many funny staffs can be done by young people .they are too busy having fun on those things to care about the communities they live in .in a word , i would state my opinion that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities after thoes reasons analyzing above .
