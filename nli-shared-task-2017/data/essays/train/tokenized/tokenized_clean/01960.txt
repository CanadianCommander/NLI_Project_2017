do successful people try new things or do what they already know how to do well ?i think successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks because a person can realize their abilities , meet luck or find the suitable choice after trying a few different things in life .first of all a person needs to try things in order to realize their abilities .for example , i learned how to play the piano when i was in third grade .i was playing it well but of course , i was nt a virtuoso .taking a risk that i might be unsuccessful , i decided to start painting last year , and i saw that i was more talented in painting .actually , now i am quite successful that think i will study design in the future , but if i did nt take the risk , i would ve lose my chance to realize my talent .therefore , i believe that a person should take risks in order to explore himself/herself .on the other hand , a person can meet their luck trying to find the best for themselves .for example when you decide to do something new like starting a new job your chance of being successful is equal to your chance of failing .as a conclusion , it is always worth trying .for another instance , you have the chance of winning the lottery when you play it , but if you do nt , you ca nt win anthing .i think you should take the risk of losing .last but not least , you can only find the suitable choice for you after a couple of trials .for example my aunt was a tailor , but she wanted to open a restaurant .in spite of the discouraging thoughts of our relatives , she opened the restaurant , and now she earns better than she did when she was a tailor .so , she was successful with her new choice .the same idea can exist whan a parson needs to choose a school .you can always try one considering the chance of being sucessful and if you do nt like it , you should have the courage to take the risk of quiting it .because you might be more successful in another .people should try new things in their lives in order to find the most suitable for themselves .successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .people should always take risks to be successful .
