although sometimes we need specialized knowlege , i agree with the statement .it is important for us to have borader knowledge of many academic subjects .the details of my reason is as follows .sometimes knowing only one subject may narrow possiblities they choose in their life .for example , my friend was studying english literature at his university .at that time he was so interested in that and did not study other subjects such as mathematics .now he is job-hunting and got stuck because english literature is not importatnt for the company which he wants to get in .much broader knowledge is required by the company .also , i found very interesting to talk to people who know things which i do not know .those people look very confident , and speak convincingly .i think the reason why they are so is connected to his/her extensive knowledge about so many different subjects .knowing about many academic subjects clearly makes people attractive .finally when people are stuck in their lives , what they can count on is themselves .they have to use their knowlege when they are in trouble .if peple have broader knowlege of many academic subjects , they might be provided with more chance to get out of troubles .to conclude i agree with the idea that people should know many academic subjects .
