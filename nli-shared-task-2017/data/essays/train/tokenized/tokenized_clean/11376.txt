in my openion young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .i do agree with the statment because i have experienced life and i have seen it .first , young people , children and kids do nt have any wories about any thing .they do nt think of bills to pay or rents or what to eat or drink .their minds are full of imaginations for their little world .for example , they have wild way of dressing up , like a prinsess or a solder .they have a wild way of drawing , they draw their family not the best way or in a professinal way but in a way that make them feel happy and satisfied .another reason is , they like to have fun and be happy in all situations .all they think of play , play play .they can all day long if you leave them with toys and friends .when they fight they do nt talk to each other for a minute or tow but after that they plat together like nothing happened .adultes however , do nt talk to the person that they are mad at for days , monther , and even years .for example , my sister got into a fight with her best friend and did not speak to her friend for a very log time .this caused their relationship to be broken untile this very day .finally , young people have young minds that are open to new thing and new ideas and learning .kids learn faster than an audalts can .this show how they enjoy life and use it to make them happy almos in every situation of their lives .in conclution , i believe that young people can and are enjoyiny life more than older people can .you can see that through the exampels that i have described in this essay and also through experience of life .i did not live my childhood life bacuse of many reasons that i will not discuss but i have learned to enjoy my life because i live it like a kid .
