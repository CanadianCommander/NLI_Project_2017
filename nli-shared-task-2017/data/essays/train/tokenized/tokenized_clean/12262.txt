success - all about experimentingsuccess is a right combination or a medley of hard wrok , experience , perseverance , expertise and also experimenting .people become successful only when they have the quench to do things and that thrist to achieve newer origins keep them striving to reach their destination . ..as said by a philosopher and i quote , success does nt come in an over night .it is the result of the turmoil you take to be a successful person .i think that sucess comes to you when you are adept at a particular skill , i agree that success is about meeting the demands and thus proving yourself by satisfying the needs of the people around you .in order to do this you need to change , adapt to the newer environment and try experimenting new things and thus tuning to the present . .for instance a person who has a well reputed pizza corner should always try to experiment new things by adding different flavours , spices or even changing the outlook of the corner he owns . ..a well reputed musician in carnatic music which is an old form of indian music can always try innovative ideas to improve the form of music to keep in track of the younger generation who are more into hip hop and jazz . ..this already succesful musician doesnt have to start from the roots but rather just enrich his knowledge .the list goes on from the invention of electric bulb by thomas alva edision to the discovery of periodic table by demetri mendeleev . .all the advancements in the techonlogies from gramaphone to the latest ultra slim mobiles phones and ipods are a result of people trying out new things .variety is the spice of life . .yes indeed it is ..but it also involves risk but isnt the ability to withstand the risk factor and fight for the odds is an easy task for a successful person . ..so , to stand one in a crowd , to be recognised , to be successful continue to try new things which vigorate you and do this with diligence and a bit of creativity .
