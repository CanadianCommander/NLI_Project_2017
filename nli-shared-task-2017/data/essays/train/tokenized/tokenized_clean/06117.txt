i completely agree with the statement .advertising is for definition false , its primary task is that of convincing , persuade or bring someone to do or buy something .in doing this , it can rely on a number of strategies .the first one is presenting a product with many more qualities than the ones it really has .a perfect image , or a modified picture , can catch the attention and convince the public .also , i saw a lot of advertisments omitting the negative things concerning the product .i think anyway that we are conscious of this but we accept it .when i read a newspaper for example , my attention focuses on a nice coloured picture and often i do not spend time reading at the bottom of the page what is written in little characters , even if i know if i woud read i would probably find something bad about what first impressed me .or also , i am watching tv and there is a famous actress advertising the new lipstick of a brand . ..immediately i feel like i want it , so i go and buy it .but when i have it i realize it has nothing more than the one from the supermarket i had before ( sometimes it could even be worst ) and it was just more expensive .anyway these are the rules and laws of advertising , they have to sell and they do everything it is permitted in order to reach their aim .advertising the false is not legal , but they always find a way to escape this crime and as i said before it is also our fault as costumers .i am convinced that there is a kind of silent agreement between us and the advertisers , as in some ways we support this .to conclude , yes , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but this is also our chance to get in touch with an ideal world .the fundamental thing is being conscious .
