i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are three reasons for this : safety , skills of foreign language , and convenience .first , it is more safer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .the tour assistants know the place where the crimes are likely to occur , so they will notice the customers about that .moreover , stolers may think that it is harder to stole something from person in group than from the person walking alone .second reason is that i am not confident of the skills of foreign languages .when we have any troubles in abroad , we feel more anxious than usual .this is partly because it is difficult to communicate with others and to catch infomations due to lack of language skills .if we have tour assistants , what to do for solving a problem is calling and asking them to help ourselves .third , travel tours are very usuful .i do not like to prepare for traveling , say , making reservations for staying or dinner , getting tickets for flight , and so on .when i travel by myself , i have to clear these steps .on the other hand , if i entry a travel tour , these steps will be cleared by the tour company .in addition , the tour assistants show famous spots for sightseeing ,it is true that we lose some extent of freedom in tours , but totally thinking ,
