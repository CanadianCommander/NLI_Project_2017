youth are the back bone of any nation .the development of nation is in their hands .so they do lot of things which include helping to communities .as being of the same group i would like to disagree with the statement .youth have a lot of reponsibilities in building strong nation .though they are involved in their restless work they do spend some time for the benefits of others .the strong reason for my disagreement is they help the community with their profession also .they are hell lot of young enterpreneurs who are looking forward to help the society by providing employment .i would like to mention the charitable organisations being established by various mnc s where lot of youth work for it .they concentrate on various basic eminities like drinking water , laying roads , conducting awareness camps , oldage homes .all these organisations are run by the youth in a fantastic way .though they do not directly involve inthe action the are the back bones of various organisation .i would like to notify this example from my personal life , during our college days we used to dedicate 2 saturday of every month to plant trees in various communities beside our college and we were awareded for that and taking that spirit we are still continuing .the works done by youth do not attract mass media or other means as they feel it as a duty rather than reponsibility .the awareness camp conduted by youth against aids has been a exellent program in the history of our country .helping to others need not require any organisation and work under it it can be a small help that you contribuited for others welfare and especially for the needy .in a nut shell , i state the being considering as a duty youth are playing a key role in improving the standards of the society by contributing quality of work without exposing to media beinga reason to supress our efforts .
