some people might think learning fact is more important than understanding ideas and concept .however , i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , it may not all that you are seeing .for example , there are so many movies out there such as charley chaplin who made very famouse movie and history of movie , and you might think that movie is stupid and just funny but nowadays people ca nt deny that it is one of the best movie so far .because he representitive that generation with the funny behaviers and people understood what he wants to express of that movie .so umderstanding is very important .moreover , it s not worth it even though you see somthing ans if you do nt understand the idea .when i see the prida callo s self - portrait , i thought it s so aufull becaus there is not even any human s face and there is only blood and animals .but after i learned to understand ideas and cocept , i totally agree and satisfied with her art wark .if people see only facts , they will miss so many beautifu and sifnificant things in their life .finally , think about seeing disabilities .even though they ca nt see at facts at all , they feel everything .so , i realized the facts are just part of our acleary , i stronly believe that understanding ideas and cocepts for discovering inportant meaning which is hided and have acknowlege to enjoy our life .
