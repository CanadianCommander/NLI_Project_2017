many people argue that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .from staying up late and doing activities to playing extreme sports , many argue that younger people has the youth to do more things that older people can not do .although it is commonly accepted that younger people are less fatigues than older people when participating in any activity , it does not mean that younger people enjoy their life more than older people .i believe that the statment , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  is false .being younger does not necessarily mean that they know how to enjoy their time well .younger people are usually enrolled into schools and universities , which gives them less if not no time to enjoy their life .also when they get older , they must find a job , and work their way up to higher position , where they would have more free time .only then would a person be able to enjoy life by doing activities that he/she enjoys .since it tends to take time for a certain individual to be in a higher position in one s own company , people gets to enjoy their life after they get older .also younger people face many disadvantages that older people does not .younger people may not have as much freedom as older people do , such as being denied to enter a bar .also an older individual usually has more money to spend for leisure time , while younger person might not have as much money to spend anything on .being younger does not only bring advantages , which offsets the disadvantages of physical limits that older people often face .although many argue that a younger individual has more capabilities , time , and youth to do activities than older people do , i believe that statement to be false .each individual s physical limits are defined by one s will power and one s own physical capabilities , and since this is the case , the situation varies among each individuals .also since being older can bring positive advantages , i believe that younger people does not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do .
