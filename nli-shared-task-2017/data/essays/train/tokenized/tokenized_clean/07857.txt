every one is able to remember when one day he ordered to a shop , thanks to an advertisement , a beautiful green pull over and just received a kind of thing he was not sure he had one day desired . ..the power of advertising !indeed i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , thanks to art photography , great transformation thanks to a computer , and then by a good presentation with music , laughs . ..first , i do think that photographers make a really good job !actually when one sees on a newspaper a really beautiful dress , wearing by a very beautiful girl , one just imagines she will be as beautiful as this !but be careful , photographer know how to make it so appealling !moreover , all the photographies are redifined by computers , with amazing logicials able to transform the whole thing in a pretty magic one !it can appear unrealistic , but i am sure that one can rarely trust what one sees : it is a ` created product  .then there is a great effort made on presentation , which sometimes can be comparated with a real show !for instance one can see on television advertisements people dancing , laughing , smiling . ..so much happiness on the screen , and for what ?a new burger !!however this works ; most of the people who were watching it will surely taste it soon .finally , even if advertisements false the reality , i think they can be so funny that i do not care .just be aware of their methods .
