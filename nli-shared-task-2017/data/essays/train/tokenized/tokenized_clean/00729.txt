i disagree with the mentioned statement .a successful person will be having complete knowledge of his specialization .he is generally percieved to be a master in his field .this , generally is true .however there is also another particular trait of a succesful man i.e he will also try to explore new avenues to improve his knowledge and skills .this is again percieved to be an over the top move or a `` risk  .but this is not true , because knowledge is an ocean whose depths are unknown .a successful person is not satisfied with the knowledge he has got and always try to do one better .a successful person always believes that if he loses the quest for knowledge he will lose the will to succeed .also if a person is satisfied with whatever he has got and achieved it leads to its stagnation and he does not grow as an individual .hence it would be inappropriate to term this quest as a `` risk  .a successful person always enjoys the pains for trying out new things or venturing into new topics .it may appear as a risk to teh watcher but for a successful person it is the divine pleasure of learning .this learning could be of various types ranging for wide range of subjects to learning something which is embibed in the nature .as long as it is constructive in building his character he is happy .more over trying new things makes us gain knowledge which is the biggest gain in life and nullifies any other loss that we could experience .a successful person can start his life fromany adversities he faces utilizing the knowlege he gained by venturing into various diffrent things .hence it would be inappropriate to say that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .
