i completely agree with the statement .today s young generation hardly gives any time to help their community .i feel so because , i have observed this .i feel if this continues , it may result in the decreasing growth of country .i had free time last weekend .so , i was roaming around in the city .the very obvious thing which i could observe everywhere was , teenagers dancing around in pubs , drinking , gaming , playing music .at the same time i could see people starving for food in slum areas next to them .but , they were not bothered at all .i felt really bad and asked myself if this is the generation which is going to run this country in coming years ?our country s future is in these hands waving unbothered in pubs ?having fun , enjoying with friends is not a bad thing to do .but , one should always realize that there is a big mob of people around you seeking your help .bringing a smile on their face would surely add a lot to your community .the young generation can always spend few hours per week to help their community .they should realize their need for their community .they should realize that the future of their country is in their hands .helping out the community is very crucial for a country because , the country grows with the development of community .the implied meaning is , the teenagers giving more time for helping out the community is crucial because , they can always utilize some portion of the time which they spend hanging around .there are many organizations formed by group of young people in order to help out the community .but , the teenagers hardly know about them and they often do nt pay attention at these things .i think , we should make today s young generation realize the importance of community services by publicizing such organization and letting young people to participate more in their activities .finally , i would say , the enthusiasm young generation should not waste their energy by hanging around .they should contribute to the country s development by giving enough time to help their community and make the country grow with them .
