i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , if we do nt understand ideas and concepts , it is difficult to have good view about facts .that means we ca nt have our own ideas and opinions .therefore , even though we can remember the facts at the time for tests , it is easy to forget the facts .for example , when i was a university student , i majored in chemical engineering .there are a lot of concepts and ideas about principles of nature .it could be impossible to memorize them .however , i tried to memorize them for test because i did nt study hard .as a result , i do nt have any knowledge about chemical engineering now .but many friends who tried to understand ideas and concepts still remember many principles of chemical engineering and they are still using their knowledge to their jobs very efficiently .whenever i see them , i envy them .i regret i just memorized facts without understanding ideas and concepts .second , if we only learn facts without understanding ideas and concepts , we are hard time adopting our knowledge to other area .in other words , learning facts is only for tests , not for real situations .if we face with same questions that we have learned , we would solve them and manage them well .however , if we face with different questions even though the concepts of it is same , we could not solve those questions because we have nt seen them before .this problem will happens because we do nt understand the facts correctly by only learning facts , we do nt have our own ideas and opinions about them .that s why we could nt solve them .in conclusion , when we are in lecture , we will learn a lot of facts which are involved in the lecture and then we must understand the ideas and concepts about the lecture .it is important to have correct views of them .
