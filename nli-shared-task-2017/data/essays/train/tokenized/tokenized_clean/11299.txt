recently , there have been discussions about whether it is better to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .while some people think it is important for them to learn facts , i would think that it is crucial for them to understand ideas and concepts .first , i think understanding of certain ideas and concepts will be applicable to various fields .when i was in a universtiy , i used to study marketing in my seminar .while i have forgotten most of facts what i have leared through the seminar , there is one thing that i still have not forgot and will be advantageous throughout my life .it is the phrase , `` what is important is methodology of thinking , but not the knowledge  from my professor .he taught me the importance of the phrase through the seminar .he often explained that in a certain sense , marketing is a methodology of how to attain one s aim .when a certain company decides its corporate strategy , it should analyze its competitiors , macro environment and resources of own company .taking all those factors into account , a company should decide its strategy .he added that this methodology , or way of thinking , is always applicable to many different fields .i completely idea with the idea .i consider that the way of thinking is essential in terms of achieving goal even at an individual level and i always practice in my work , while i am now working for a financial company .second , under a rapidly changing environment , i consider that facts will become obsolete so fast .i work as a fund manager in london , analyzing japanese companies .in my work , i have a number of opportunities to talk with managements and corporate directors from companies , where i learn precious information every time i have meetings with them .although what i have to point out is that those `` facts  which i learn are no longer beneficial for me just couple of months later .this is because market environment surrounding companies changes dramatically in very short time , thus the companies  strategies will subsequently have to be adapted .therefore , the facts once used to be brand new will be no longer valid in three months time .given the facts , i normally try to ask companies of thier thoughts and ideas underlying certain strategies they implement .this will make me project what kind of strategies they will make when environment changes .in conclusion , as understanding of concepts and ideas can be applicable to various fields , while facts will become old in relatively short period of time , i would definitely argue that the former is more critical than the latter .
