young people these days tend to have less contribution to their communities compared to the previous generation ( s ) , this is very obvious if we had a look at the behavior of most of the youngsters , for example young people in the old days used to help their families working in farms , raising cattles or in any other business the family might run .they were also very compassionate to other poor people were they used to look after them or help them as much as they can .whereas these days young people are found to be much less of a help to thier families or to the community in general ; they tend to look after their own interests or even spend any spare time relaxing .there are several reasons to this change in behavior :the first and most important reason is that the whole world is demanding more and more on currency for living , the demands of an an average person are increasing too which leads to more work required to keep up with the accelerating life style .communities are growing bigger which lead to having less effort being done to community members .also religious instructions are not being taken as seriously as they used to be and hence less help is being provided to the community .in conclusion changing life style lead to change in behavior and personality of the young people and as a result young peolpe are less helpful than they used to be .
