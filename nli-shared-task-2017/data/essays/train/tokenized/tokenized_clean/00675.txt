my interpretation of successful people is not just based in either try something new or take risks .however i agree with those people that believe that by doing new things , they may get a better chance and opportunity in life , if the case is that their reality is not good enough for themselves .i think that get new ideas , give a try to new experiences , let you open your mind to a very important thihgs such as tolerance , diversity and knowlodge .along my short life , i been thinking that life is a beautiful moment , that let you choose .that each one of us take their own risk , even to let pass the good oportunities or even to take them , however not always take the risk is good and is the best choice .i believe that if you do nt let go the things out , if you just close your life and you do nt look higher of what you have , life can become pretty plane .i respect all of these people that rather being in the same place and doing the same work during all their lifes , than the ones that feel that learn and have a bigger knowledge doing something new , is part of grow and really enjoy life .however , i would like to ask these people , how they preffer being who they are , and doing what they do , if they do nt know something else ?here i am not talking about success , i am talking about happiness and according with my own thoughts and ideas , happiness connect success and success people is happy .
