the present statement is a false dichotomy on an essential academic topic : is breadth of knowledge better than specialized knowledge ?i will develop the reasons why i consider that building broad and specialize knowledge are both essential and complement each other .to have a wide knowledge of many academic subjects is essential nowadays and will be even more important in the future .the world we live in moves fast and new technologies have enabled an exponential growth of network connections between people from different background and cultures .therefore having a broad understanding of different cultures and industries is key for an individual to understand and evoluate in our world .conversely , specific and specialize knowledge is essential in order to contribute to the development of our civilization .to master all the aspects and challenges of the discipline is essential in order to contribute to its development .having insight on a specific topic is a strength which could infer numerous jobs opportunities .one of my science teacher at university used to say that the more specialize a discipline is , the more broad knowledge you need to understand the mechanisms of nature and physics .he used to think that somehow many scientific disciplines converges towards a unique truth ( an old scientist dream ) .as a conlusion , i believe there are no reasons for contending that broad knowledge is more essential than specialize knowledge ( or vice-versa ) .as a matter of fact , i consider they complement each other .i would even add that what is essential in our today world is to learn how to learn in order to be able to adapt ourselves to our ever fast muting civilization .
