many of the people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , some of the people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do .i aggre with that older people enjoy life more than young people do , because of that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time .young people always have problems with their life .they never think time is very fast .they only live without scare of death .for example i and my friend always have problems .because of our promblem many of time we dont want to do any things .we often speks about our problems .we think to go to holiday for reducing from stress .nonethless we post pone it to other summer and other summer never come so we never go to anywhere .on the other hand , older people think time is very fast .for an example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how was she be a older woman .she says that ` i fell myself as a young girl if i had a change to live life again i would travel all over the world` .she always goes cinema for to watch movies .she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she didnt go before .moreover my grandfather is too interesting old man.he is a good tenis playe .he plays tenis every day .he takes lot of interesting photos to tell life .to sum up , like my grandmother and garadfather older people lenjoyl
