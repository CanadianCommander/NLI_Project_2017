the issue at hand is chosing weather young people enjoy their lives more than old people or not .i think that the answer to this question is obvious , the young people enjoy their lives much more than old people for four main reasons ; young people can go to to entertainment places , they have a lot of friends , they can be hierd easily anywere , and they are not counting down for their lives to end .young people can go to different entertaining places and have fun in their lives , they can go to parties any time they want , they can do most of the sports the want to do , even the hardest things such as climbing on mountains , or sky diving .however the old people can not get the entertainement the want wheever they want , that is because of many reasons , first thing they can not go to parties because it is not appropreate for them to go there .also old people can not play all sports they want to play , and that is because their bodies are not able to play these games , for example an old man can not go skydiving .young people can easily get new friends whenever they want , and that is beside their `` living friends  , so they will enjoy having friends , and they can even do anything thay want to do with them .on the other hand the old people face hardness in meeting with new people , and also we can assume that many of their old friends are dying or will die .youth can get most of the jobs , even employers usually are looking for youth not old people to hire , and so all of the youth can get the jobs they like and enjoy them .but the old people can not get the jobs the want , and most of them can not get any job , simply because they are retierd , and if they got a job usually it would be a boaring enterprenural job with no peers to have fun with .finally youth can enjoy their lives much more thn old people that is because the do not have to worry that they are going to die any tiem , but old people are fearing from the moment they will die .in a conclusion , youth have much more fun in their lives than old prople do , and that because young people have the opportunity to see life .
