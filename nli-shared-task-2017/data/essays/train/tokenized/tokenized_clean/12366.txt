i agree the statement `` it is more important for students to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact  we can see those situation eveywhere all the time .for example .when you start it new job , you do nt know anything abuout this job .so even you get new stuff which you have to do , you can not do it and might get confused .so the people who work there longer than you , teach you how to do you r stuff .however , if he / she teach you just the fact , you will be ok at the time .but you might be get confused next time .because you do nt understand the basecly work which is idea and cpncept .this kind of situation will be at school also .for example the boys girls who just start to go school and if they have first math class .of course they do not any skill math .but , if the teacher gives them question about 2/3 + 3/2 , the students can not understand it .because they do not any basic math skill .in conclusion , it is more important for students to understand idea and concepts than it is for them t
