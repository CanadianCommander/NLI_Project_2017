after 20th century , car became one of the most familiar thing to people .now it is hard to find households which have no cars .however , it affects environment seriously and also brings more and more traffic congestion .certainly it needs some change and it will change to a positive way but we can not say there will be fewer cars in twenty years .car is an essential one in our life and i would say even the society will not be properly going without cars .in this situation , we can not imagine the life without cars .not only personal cars but also buses and taxis should be included .governments try to reduce the number of cars in their countries but it is not an easy process .firstly , they need get agreents from their people and who would give up their cars ?without a brilliant solution , it will not work .however , there will be different kind of change , change on sorts of cars .many famous car companies are traying to make more environment-friendly cars for the future .hybrid car or electricity car can be good examples .also , there are some people who make a car only using solar energy .once car companies start to make those cars , there will be even more people who want to drive a car because it that case , no need to spend lots of money for fuel .car has got important status in our life already so nothing can replace its role like a mobile .it is into our life deeply and even more and more children get their own mobile .i think there will be a same situation in car market .more and more young people will buy cars and it will be pretty easy to get a car in cheap price .to conclude , since those reasons that i mentioned above , road will still be full of cars after twenty years .it must be a different kind of cars , however .environment-friendly , driver-fiendly cars will appear in ten years and also we might welcome flying cars like in a movie .flying cars will be too further from but the important thing is cars will not disappear ever .
