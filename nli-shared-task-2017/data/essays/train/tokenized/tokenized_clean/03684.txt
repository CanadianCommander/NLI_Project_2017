i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of just specialize in one certain subject .there are many reasons supporting my opinion .first , i believe that academic subjects are the path leading to the knowledge of the world , therefore one should nt limit his or her time devoting within only one subject ; people , especially college students , should take various courses in all kinds of fields before they decide what certain academic field they wish to receive further education .if we only study one certain field , we will loose the whole forest for one tree .second , i believe that although knowledge is categorized into assorted academic subjects , each individual subject is related to one another ; therefore we could not possibly understand one subject without studying the others .for example , math is considered as `` the mother of all science ,  but people studying in philosophy still need to learn math in order to understand the foundation of logic , no less than researchers in physics , engineering , or finance fields .last but not least , as the old saying goes , `` learning is like buliding a pyramid ; the broaden you build it , the taller it reaches .by learning widely initially we can easily understand a specific subject later .moreover , if we can not absorb a broad range of academic subjects , our perspectives will also be narrowed .we wo nt be able to accept opposite ideas and multiple opinions from other , nor will we be willing to adopt new thoughts and images from subjects outside of our own instantly .in conclusion , i believe that `` jack of all trades is also master of one .a person who acquires broad knowlege of many academic subjects could undoubtedly achieve speciality in one specific subject too .therefore , i agree with the idea that the former is better than the latter .
