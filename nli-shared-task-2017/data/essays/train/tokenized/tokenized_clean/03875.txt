nowadays when we see the movie on the tv we can see a lot of advertisements .generaly the adverdisements has a connection with the sitcom or the movie , for example when we see a sitcom about a students life ( dawson , beverly hills ) the advertisements whose follow is the products for the students , and young people .the question is difficult because the goal of the advertisements is to catch the customer to buy the products and how the advertisements seem much better than they really are ?we can take some reasons to answer to this question .first reason , in the most advertisements we can t see really the products we have for example two peolple whose kissing much better and the topic of this advertisement is to buy a car , i wonder what is the connection between the kiss and the car .secondly when you read your news paper there a lot of adverdisem ent not interesting .for example we have a picture of the lot of the men in the fuel appartement and just the name of the compagny we can t find the connexion its just to sell the name of the famous compagny .last reasons the advertisements make the bad effects toward the children .when the child seated in front of his tv and when he sees a advertisements with a fight or a gun , he wants to do like the person of the advertisements .to contrast this reason we have most adavertisements to prevent to the people by teh danger of the car or the fire at home , in this case the advertisements make producs than they really are .finally i agree withs this statement because the bad effects of the advertisements is several and much dangerous for the children and for the young .
