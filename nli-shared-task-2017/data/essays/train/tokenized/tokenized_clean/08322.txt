i agree with that people had better have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .there are two reasons .first , it make people who do not have broad knowledge oto have difficulties in the companie or society .when we get jobs or enter the schools , we have oppotunities of talking with many people .at the time , however , we have only one spcific knowledge , for example the knowledge about mathematics , we can speak only about mathematics .it has possibility of giving other people the impression that you are boring person .it is very dagerous and we may be not able to lead a nice our lives in the society .second , to studying one specific subject make your future very narrow one .for example , when the person who have been studying the mathematics in order to be a professor changes his or her mind and the person want to be a animal doctor , what the person should do ?he or she has the knowledge only about mathematics so he or she can not change his or her future job now .the person who have studied only one specific subject can not change or dicide their future again once they decided thier future in thier childhood .in conclusion , to specialize in one specific subject have dagerousness possibilities in deciding of the futures .therefore , i agree with the former statement .
