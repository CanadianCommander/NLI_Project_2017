i used to like to go travel and almost my travel was followed a tour guide .even though i was very young i did nt want to having time with a tour guide because it was very uncomprotable for me .i actually wanted having only our family .so most of time i felt if i grow up in the future , i will go travel by myself .then dreams came ture .when i became adult , i went to trip only me and my friend .throught that travel , i realized that traveling by my self is much better to see everywhere and without a guide trip made me a feeling of freedom travel , many experiences , and making new friends .first of all , i could feel like freedom without a guide because i could visit more many places which is not expensive but more beautiful .however , if i go travel with a guide , i can go only limited place and i will not feel trip , i will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone .second , i will get variety experiences .if i go to french ,third , i can make new overseas friends .actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem .however , it could be chance to contect new people .if i do nt feel dangerous or scared , i can have a question to native poeple .also it will help me to go more general place , which means native s usual place , or if my new friends come to my contry , i will help them , either .in short , i prefer to trip without a tour guide because i do nt want to
