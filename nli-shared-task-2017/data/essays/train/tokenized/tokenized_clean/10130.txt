the thesis that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a quite generalized statement , which requires to be examined .firstly it is important to point out which things are required to enjoy a human s life .to my mind even this question can not be anwered in an objective way because most requirements differ from human to human .when we take a look at the example of having or earning a lot of money even there are differences among the people .for one person it is very important to have a well-paid job for another it is not .in addition to that the opinions about what is a well-paid job or what is a lot of money are quite different .but let us have a look at the example of being healthy .maybe it can be stated that a good health is an universal requirement to enjoy life .to my mind there is nearly a unity in the opinions of people about the importance of health to have fun in life .despite of the fact that it can not be generally stated what good health is and when somebody is ill or not let me use health as an example for a general requirement to enjoy life .based on this assumption it is difficult to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because all people at any age can have fun in their lives in relation to their physical abilities .maybe it is not possible for an old grandfather to be the fastest in a 100-meter-run , but instead of this he can do a lot of other things like going on a long journey or writing books or essays .a lot of young people do not have enough time to enjoy these things .on the other hand an older person is limited in his actions by his physical abilities ( see the example of the 100-meter-run ) .but this can also happen to a disabled young person who is not able to walk .all in all i must say that it is not correct to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because there are so many differences among all people .
