in my opinion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of a specialization in one of them .i say this because i think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today s society , where companies are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new works .according to this , school must provide to give a basical instruction , teaching many different subjects .in this way , each student will have a quite complete background in the fileld he choose .i think that also specialization is important for work , of course , because it implies that a person is really good on doing something specific .but i also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with years and years of study and work , and school ca nt give this opportunity to everybody .an example : i study design , but lots of kind of designs .interior design , virtual design , graphic design and much more .but what i really like to do is web design .so , school gives me first the opportunity to learn about different tipes of design and , second , to understand which is the best for me .after the school i can specialize myself in web design by work , because i have a basical preparation that school gave me , and , in the same time , the other students in my class could choose another specialization , according to their preferences .this model of teaching subjects gives lots of advantages , because it is nt neither rigid nor boring .it gives anyone the possibility to choose , without create limits .academic subjects are only the start up of the student s working life , that he can and must develope in his career .but at the same time they are very important , because allow the student the opportunity to understand what he really like to do in his future .
