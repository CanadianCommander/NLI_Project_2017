i agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .eventhough it is also important to learn facts , it is more valueable to get the ideas or concepts of everything for several reasons .first of all , it is easy to know facts everytime after you get older .in contrast , it is harder to understand the concept of some fundamental things .ideas and concepts should be obtained in your young age to contract the right way of thinking .for example there is quite a lot of lows that constrain people s behavior such as that people can not kill the other people .it is quite easy to know the facts , but the most important thing a person should know is why there are such lows and understand correctly the concept of them .secondly , the important thing for people is to apply the ideas to the other situations .even if you learned facts , it is worhless unless you understand the concept behind the facts .for an instance , you learn a new formula in math class .the formula is a `` fact  in this case .you can solve a simple question using it , however , it is hard to solve difficult or complicated questions for you if you do nt understand the basic idea of the formula .in the real world , people will meet several difficult problems .to solve them , people need to apply what they learned into the completely different situations .the facts will not help them at that time .therefore i recommend students to understand the ideas or the concept than to acknowledge only the facts .
