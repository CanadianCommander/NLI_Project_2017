along with the development of mass media and mass culture came the development of advertisement , helping to create what is called `` the consumer society  .advertisement is supposed to make you buy a product , it is a message that makes the product appealling so that you buy it .in order to do so , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it is a very common experience to be disapointed by what you just bought .i just bought an mp3 player because it looked great on the advertisement but i discovered that it does not work with many computers .this is the time when one says `` it looked so much better in the commercial  .advertisements are not to be blame for that because it is their very purpose : to make you buy .in order to do so , it has to show what is best in the product .it is very rare to see a commercial that will ill-speak of a product .it does exist and it is called `` negative publicity  but even this is a form of advertisement .most of the time an advertisement will just focus on what is great about a product .if advertisements sometimes make products seem much better than they really are , advertisements are not allowed to lie about the product .if they do , the advertisement company can be sued for `` false advertisement  .that means that an advertisement never really lies but just shows the product in a way that makes you want to buy it .having realized that it is the very role of advertisement to show products under their most appealling appearance , perhaps one should consider the consumer s responsibility .indeed one should not always take for granted what is said in a commercial .it is his responsability to use his critical sens and not be misguided by advertisements .this is a lesson i learned the rough way !
