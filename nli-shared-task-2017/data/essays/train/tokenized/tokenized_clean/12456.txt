the 21st century is the century of more technological developement than any century before could achieve and the century of unsufficient sources .due to the population growth , on of the concerns of the scientists and researchers is the transportation problem .one side of transportation problem is the number of cars in the traffic .the traffic rush , the pollution and the gas are the problems of car use .the technological developement may be used to protect the planet and find new sources of energy or use existing sources more efficiently .therefore , we can argue that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today : firstly , because there wo nt be enough gas for all the cars in use and secondly , there will be new ways of public transportations , like the millenium s invention , the `` ginger  , or cost-efficient flying objects .on the other hand , technological predictions on the future were always been a source of inspirations for the scientists , but never been accurate .for exemple , according to 2001 : a space oddesey by arthur c.clark , we should have been living on other planets by now .or if predictions were true , jules verne s novels would nt mostly be unrealized .therefore , we can state that , according to the growing numbers of cars in use , in twenty years there will be even a lot more number of car on the roads .in conclusion , we can say that the future depends on us .if in twenty years , we learn to be more proactive and begin to take initiatives , people s awareness of the damage and pollution of cars could prevent the growing number of cars in use .nevertheless , if we keep on persisting on individual gain and forgeting about the planet s sake , there will be much more cars riding on the roads every day .
