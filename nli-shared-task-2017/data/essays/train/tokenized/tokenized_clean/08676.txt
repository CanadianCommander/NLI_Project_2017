i agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than learning facts .if a student invests his time to understand the basal ideas and concepts on a matter rather than just learning the facts he can use these in similar subjects .generally humans tend to do just as much as neccesary to solve a problem they faced .so many students are just learning the facts to pass exams .but they often seemed to forget the importance of ideas .as an example in my first year in mechanical engineering i learned in my material sciences course not only the facts or calculations for the exam .i used very much time to understand the consepts of structure of materials .after i passed the exam that i could really understand the basics of solid mechanics and it helped me very much for my preparation time for this course .i have seen that my investment really paid back .in other hand the concepts or ideas are more likely to be reminded in later years .the learned facts can replaced by new ones and you could not remind them even after some days .as we are students and learning the subjects to use them we have to call them whenever we need .for example i have been a very good student in high school and especially in physics .after i begin with the university i have seen that i could not remind some formulas in physics which i used to know .but with my understanding for physics helped me to derive them for very basic formulas .hence when trying to learn a subject it better to use more time for understanding then just learning facts .
