i agree with the statement .knowing facts is very important but we always need to think , and i believe that it is more important to have better understanding of things and concepts to make good decisions in real life .understanding ideas and concepts give you a skill of sloving a problem when you come across to something .understanding ideas and learning facts are closely connected .if you have an idea about something , you think about it , learn about it , and everntually learn a fact .in another word , is a process of learning facts .for example , if you know what is happening in iraq , if you do nt have an understanding for it , you do nt do anything for it .facts without your opinion or concepts are useless even though how important the fact is .process will leads you to the result and you learn a lot of things through out the process .i believe this from my experience .once when i had a homework to search about the titanic , i was just looking for a website that says what happened to it in the beginning , but soon i realized there were lots of things that happened other than sinking nad i learn much more interesting event that actually happened before it sank .process is more important than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact .sometimes , i say to myself `` care about process than a fact  because it is easy to forget and only look for a fact .
