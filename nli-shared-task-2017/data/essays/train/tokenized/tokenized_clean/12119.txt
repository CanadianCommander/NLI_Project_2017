today , we tend to prefer changing lifestyle , trying new things and taking risks rather than holding on to what we have and what we already know .but thinking about it , i believe that it is sometimes worth the pain to stay with what what we already know .taking risks can indeed be seen as the better way to live one s life strongly .it is the best way to avoid a borring life , for example waking up every morning , fourty yers along , to go to the same place , work with the same poeple .it is clearly more appealing to decide one day to become a teacher , because you already know everything beeing a doctor could bring to your life .this viewpoint allows you to feel adventurous and to have , maybe , several lifes in one life .however , i would like to defend my point thet sometimes holding to what we already have is more responsible , more interesting , and can lead you to a happier life .it appears to me that it is better to deepen one s knowledges in a particular field than to try to know everything .for instance , one should rather concentrate on a specific field of study than trying to tempt everything because he wants to try new things .it is better , then , to try to make the things we already have work well than to escape each time we feel ennoyed .i believe that this is a value people are tending to loose today in our societies , and this may be an explaination for the spectacular increase of divorces .to conclude , i think that we are too often tempted to escape from what we have , while we should rather hold on and try our best to make the things we already have work .
