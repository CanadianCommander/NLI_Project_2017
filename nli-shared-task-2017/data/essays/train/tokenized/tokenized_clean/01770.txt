since the first car was created , the number of cars have increased every year .from my point of view that will be the same in the next years .i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .basically i belive the social demand will going on increasing .city are overcrowed and we tend to emigrate from the cityies to areas closed to the city but more calm and sometimes with less pollution that the city one .if we live some kilometres far to the city we will need a transport to go there .there is public transport , but usually it is expensive and less confortable than a car .human love to be confortable even if that damage for instance the environement .because of that , because we love confortability , we will usually choose our own car in stead of the public transport to move ourselfs .secondly , i belive in several years a less-polluted car will be created .people are more concern with the environement than years ago .we think more in the environement , damage , pollution causes , consecuences .in fact , scientifcs are reaserching a way to built car that emited less gases to the atmosphere , as electrical car .if they achive their aim , we will have `` healthy  car and we will not have moral conflicts in uses them whenever we wanted .i mean , that maybe now , there are peolple worried about the pollution and because of that he , she doenot take car as much she woukd like .in conclusion , because of the arguments aboved mentioned , ( there are other but the time is out ) in my opinion we could see much car running the roads that the number of them tha we can see now .
