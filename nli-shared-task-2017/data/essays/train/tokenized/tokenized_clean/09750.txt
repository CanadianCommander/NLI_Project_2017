what is the best way to travel ?although some people prefer to travel by themselves without any tour guide , i particular prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide because it offers various advantages such visting famous places , making new friends and save time .first , traveling in a group led by a tour guide takes people to famous places .for example , if i go to paris in this way , i will visit the most important places in the city .i might know the best of paris .on the other hand , if i go by myself , i need to use a map and learn about the tourist places .in this way , i might miss important places .moreover , traveling in group by a tour guide gives the chance to make friends .this type of trips are usually in groups of 20 or 30 people .if i go with this group , i meet people of different countries and cultures .i can also meet people of different ages .then i can keep in contact with them after the trip .finally , going on a trip in group led by a tour guide help people to save time .people will go straight to main places without getting lost .consequently , people will not waste time trying to get to a place because they will be guide by an expert of the area .for example , if want to visit the best places in boston , i can just trust and follow the tour guide because he knows very well the places and the area better than me .in this way , i can plan to visit the most interesting places in boston in a short time because someone will guide me .to sum up , i think that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide due to the benefits it gives me .these are the opportunity to visit the best places in a town , city , or country , the chance to make new friends and the advantage of save time .in this way , people can have more fun on a trip .
