i want to state my opinion wether a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than to specialize in one subject .both ways have their specific advantages and disadvantages which i would like to state in the following text .having a broad knowledge is always an advantage , not only when it comes to game-shows like `` who want s to be a millionaire  .knowing a lot gives you an open view to the world as it is .it opens you for alternative explanations and solutions and might even make you into a more tolerant person .even though from this point of view it seems very usefull to gather a broad knowledge it also brings with it some problems .many specific knowledge is what makes you an expert in some area .when beeing a competitive person who always tries to be the best you will not achieve your goal , if you are not focussing your energy to some few subjects and even if you are not competitive the everyday job-requirements force you to have a certain amount of knowledge about a special subject .even though the capacity of the human brain seems to be nearly unlimited , the time of most humans is not .getting a broad knowledge needs a lot of time to gather this knowledge .if you try to get to this knowledge on a university you soon will have to face the fact , that not just the time but also the money of most persons is limited .in most countries all over the world , studying is not for free .even in germany where universities where free for decades a growing number of federal countries is intoducing study fees .so at one point or another most people have to make a decision between the amount of knowledge to gather , and the time and money they got to do this .in my opinion a broad knowledge is an ideal which is very hard to reach .so i think it is better to first concentrate on one subject and to get to know everything possible about it , get a job by using that knowledge and try to broaden your horizon afterwards .not doing so will turn you into an unemployed academic with a broad knowledge .when talking about this topic another pretty important thing has to be mentioned .more important than finding time to gather knowledge , is to make sure you do nt loose the one you once had .in germany it is said , that when finishing highshool one has the broadest knowledge in his whole life .when starting to study often just a few months are needed to loose this knowledge , mostly because one focusses on his primary subject in college .so maybe the mentioned ideal is easier to reach by not forgetting knowledge than by gathering it .to summarize my personal view : i for myself always try to gather as much knowledge as possible even though i know it is just possible within certain limits given by the environment .but even though it is surely better to have this broad knowledge i will never say a bad word about someone who just tries to be the best in his primary subject .
