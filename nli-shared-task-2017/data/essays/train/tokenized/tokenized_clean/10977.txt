experiencing the convinience of the car , we can not keep cars away from our society .most citizens living in advanced society use cars almost everyday .many parents drive students to school every morning , and many wives send her husbands to their companies .in this environment is it true that in twenty tears , there will be fewer cars in use than there are todat ?i disagree with the statemet that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today because there are still lots of people who will use cars in 20 years .what accelerate the nuber of cars within 20 years ?now , there are still lots of people who do not have the licence of cars , especally in developing country which has billions of population but whose people do not affort that now .however within 20 years , they seem to develop more than now .if chinese people , more than12 billions , will become affluent , the number of cars is absolutely increasing .no one can deny this fact .since the area of china is extraordinary large , the need of car should be high .postulated that the one-third of chinese will get a car , the number is 4 billions !!ofcouse the country that have possibility to increase the number of cars is not only china .india , kenia , levanon , or cuba have great possibility .therefore , the number of cars must be increased with the development of those countries .having said that there are people who insist that the nubmer of cars will decline in twenty years .however they tend to ignore the possible number of people who use cars in the future .therfore their idea should be disimissed an inapproproate .i believe that the nubmer of cars will radically increase becase there are many people who know the convinience of cars in the future especially in developing countries .
