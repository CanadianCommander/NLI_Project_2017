i disagree with the statement .in my opinion , it is better to be specialised in one field rather than have incomplete knowledge of several subjects which may not serve any purpose .its no good being `` jack of all trades - master of none  .a person having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is like a blunt knife .it has a large area and zero penetrating power .a specialist , on the other hand , can make breakthroughs in his field and contribute more to the society .these days the knowledge of each subject is very vast .to know about everything and then assimilating that information into something miraculous is not possible .the days are gone when a leonardo da vinci could paint masterpieces , write mathematical theories and create models for an aircraft .today s cutting edge technology requires specialists from diverse fields who can work together and bring about a significant development .for example , consider a car manufacturing company .it does not have all its employees knowing how a combustion engine works , much the same way as it does not have all of them knowing how to market its cars .it has specific people for a specific job .it has promoters to fund development , engineers to design cars , accountants to operate logistics and advertisers to sell a car .it is a team of diverse elements , each a master in his or her respective field , that can contribute something useful .these days many pioneering researches are carried out by groups of scientists who are proficient in their respective field .a physics and a chemistry expert may collaborate to give something that one could not have hoped to achieve by himself .a scholar who knows something about everything can not do much when the requirement is everything about something .humanity has thrived on its dynamism and diversity .to avoid stagnation , we need specialists as the fields of knowledge have outgrown the capacity of a single human .a jack may fit anywhere in the pack of cards but it never beats the king .
