young people , middle age people , old people .i think that people change with the times affecting lots of things like , behaviour , points of view , believings , fears , pleasures , entertainment . ..i suppose long time ago , people were very worried about building the world up , but nowadays developed countries have created a mass media - business world .ancient times were seasons for learning , for knowledge , for wisdom , for care about human nature , as books are showing us every time we open one of them .and we ca nt make divisions between young or old people , but talk about societies .in my humble opinion , societies that care about education had always great results as ancient greeks or for example japanese , nowadays we can feel a sense of corruption everywhere , because it seems that societies have forgotten about education .young people are worried for example for their weight , cause if they do nt look like the models that the mass media distributes around the continents , they think they are not socially accepted .but this mass media also show them everytime-everywhere , those high fat products with smiles and perfect bodies , treating them .young people care about fashion , about the last clothing , the last film , the last videogame , or the last musical tendency .in this sense , we can say that they create their own communities in different trends .for example , a disc jockey , feeds their public every night , with the best music he can play to entertain people , as mozart creates great composing music for the court time ago .in such way they are helping the community , but in ways never humanity has done .young people try to hide , or to do the opposite , sometimes , that adults use to do .i know it sounds like a child behaviour but you can see it .another times , another people , another worries , new social mental diseases . ..as a part of the society , the world has a lot of things to worry about , and i think the best weapon people ever had was education .
