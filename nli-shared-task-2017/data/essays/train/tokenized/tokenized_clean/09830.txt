i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i bought a food with looking nice picture last week .even though , when i cooked as exactly what the direction says , it looked defferent and it was not very nice .those kind of things should have happeded to most people .i understand that they are doing business and they are trying to get more customers and sell the products .however , i do nt thing they should make advertisement make products seem better than they really are for three reasons .first , it makes people who bought the product disapointted .the light used in the picture on the advertisement and angles can make the product looks better .in addition , if the customer did not like the real product , they wasted their money .it is like cheating and not fair .finally , the company might be complained by the customers .the customers will not buy the same product if they are disapointted by the product which were showed nicer than they really are .the product wil be popular only the begining and the profit will not get any better or get worse .people are happy and dreaming when they are looking at the advertisement .it is true that nice looking advertisement make people feel good .although , people get more desapointted and sad if the difference is so big .nice and beautiful advertisement give people dream but if it is not true , it is cheating .it is not good to show not real looks .
