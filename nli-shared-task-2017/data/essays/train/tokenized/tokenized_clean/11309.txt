now a days the ways of gaining knowledge changed verymuch for the students .some will prefer to learn by understanding the ideas and concepts .some will prefer to learn by facing the facts .it s depend upon the age of the students also .if i were asked i ll definitely prefer the idea of learning facts .the reasons for this is , it can last for a long time .it will be useful to the student in the future field of work .the students have very less chance to commit the mistakes also .learnig the facts makes the students to think practically and also allowed them to think independently .now a days if we take any eductaion system it is going on the wrong track in some countries .the school and colleges are not giving much chances to the students to think practically .they encourage the spoonfeeding .even for the small thing also he need to depend on the their teachers .because of competition they forced the students to understand the concepts and ideas .if a student learn the concept by facing it or experiencing it it will be last very long time in his mind .learnig the facts also make students to be very efficent in the future field of work .here the students can easily implement whatever he learnt in the student days .he can distinguish among many people .here his job will be very easy to him .another thing is that students have very small chances to commit any mistakes .because he learned by his own experience he wo nt commit any mistakes .from the above cited points i conclude that the students who learned by understanding the facts will definitely efficient than the others .however it may be time taking proces for a studnet to learn by facing the facts i ll definitely prefer the concept of learning by facing facts .
