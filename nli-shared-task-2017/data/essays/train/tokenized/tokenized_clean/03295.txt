although i understand people who think that young people nowadays do not spend enough time on helping their communities my experiences led me to disagree with this statement .nevertheless , there are reasons to believe that this statement is true .young people nowadys are often afraid of remain jobless after finishing university .as a result they spend all their time on preparing themselves for their professional life .for example , most of my fellow students spend a lot of time on making internships , so there is no time left to voluntarily participate community activities .further more the people in our society are getting older and older whereas the government has less money to spend on social services .consequently , there is a need for young people who give time to help their community , especially in homes for the elderly .on the other hand giving time to help the community where you live in , can however be important for your professional life .in spite of the fact that you are not dealing with the topics of your study while working , for example , in home for the elderly it might make a good impression of your social engagemant if you apply for a scholarship .a lot of students know this and therefore it is often the case that students engage voluntarily in community projects .furthermore there are a lot of people in my social environment who are really interested in politics and the development of our society .as a result they participate in local political projects or in one of the existing political parties , which means that they also give time to their community .in view of the fact that i know a lot of young people who engage in their community my conlusion is that it is not true that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
