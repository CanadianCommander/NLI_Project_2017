as far as i am concerned from my own life ; young people really enjoy life more than elderly people .having fun from life is a wide range area for debating .however ; fun is a fun !needless to say young people do it in a more efficient way in their whole lifes .we can see it from many examples from thir life styles .firstly ; there is an energy inside young people for doing many activities .they really want to learn life by trying different and excited activities .most of them are enjoyable ones which show differentiation in different people .by way of illustration ; driving faslty is an exciting hobby for young people .however it is too hazardeous .therefore old people do not want to this as a hobby for living more !eventually they know the risk of it s results .anyway it is an enjoyable activity in closed areas .is nt it ?secondly ; young people are rather interested in technology instead of using the ancient models of technology .it has many enjoyable products like play station ; computer games ; cell phones . ..etc .young people would like to buy new products ; whereas the elderly people could not get accustom to the new technology .thus : they use the old models until they broke .playing a play station game has been my best hobby since my child times .you really become more relax than anytime in your life .because its games include interesting characters and also places which you have never seen before .however ; according to elderly people it is a waste of time .isn ` t it a boring thought ?to conclude ; the life is too short ; then why we do nt enjoy for feeling more happy and relax ?i think older people could not think the importance of enjoy .they may be do some enjoyable events but presumably it is not enjoyable for younger people .it is high time that they should enjoy life !
