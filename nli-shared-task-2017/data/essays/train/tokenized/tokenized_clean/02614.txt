i disagreee with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .ther main reasons i support the idea are time and money .first of all , we the youg have to do things to do even though we do not want to do .for example , high school students have to go to the school everyday , or do homework of their dislike subjects .on the other hand , the elderly can spend their time on way their own .nobody blames their way of using their spare time .secondly , older people have money that thay have earned for a long time .they can travel with their close friends or neighbors , or start the second business spending those money .however , youg people has limitation of their money , because most of their money come from their parents .it makes them think about on what they they should spend money , in short , thay can not afford to travell abroad .another reason is satisfaction and comfortablness .elderly people who had finish the role as a worker are confident to their skills that has supported thair country s industry .at the same time , they might feel camfortable with the dedication .these feelings make them happy , so they can enjoy the rest of their lives .in contrast , the young always feel uncomsortable , and are under the pressures from their parents or teacher .they they think thay have to do manything to their country or family .it causes mental problem .for those reasons , i think older people enjoy life than young people .
