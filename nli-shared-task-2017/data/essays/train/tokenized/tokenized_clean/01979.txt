i agree this topic ; young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .first , i think now is information society .they have a lot of things to do .now there are many kind of materials .for example , internet , tv games , and mobile phone .they constrate their things .internet , tv game are very fun more than to helping their communities .second , i think now is individual society .people are selfish .current s people are very busy .i think ancient ages s time more slowly .people must do something everyday .they do nt have sufficient free time .especially , yong people must go to school , study hard to take high level education .third , i think they want to helping their communities , however , they do nt know how to care about community .now , they do nt have many brother or sister .and , they were playing indoor .i think they do nt know how to communication another people .however , they want to take care about communities .but they are very shy .their mind is very beautiful , they only do nt have encourage .i think they do nt have enough time to helping their communities .young people must think their communities .human can think about another people .
