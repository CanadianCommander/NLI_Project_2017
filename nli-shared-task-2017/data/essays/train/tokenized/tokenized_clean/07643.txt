cars are freedom and independence !that s what many people think about cars offering them the opportunity to travel individually everytime and to whereever they want .i think that therefore in twenty years there will be at least as many cars used in the world as there are nowadays , and i ll try to show some more reasons for that in this essay .first of all , people are very slow in changing their habits , so even a new technology would not suddenly stop them all driving cars .and there is no technology to expect in the next few years that could challenge with that flexibility of a cabin that can be freely driven by one person , in other words it seems that there will be no alternative to cars for years .if you think about cars in the future you should definetly take a closer look at asia .china and india develop quickly and will soon use a lot of cars , and remember that we are talking about nearly one third of the world s population !noone could stop them from using that easy and quick transportation technology , so they will be happy to start using it like the western world was in the middle of the last century .some people say that there would not be enough oil for future use of cars .but experts predicts that the oil would last for at least another 50 years and in addition every year more fields are discovered .to come back to the first and most important point , the flexibility of cars offering independence to their drivers , it has to be asked if you would be giving up that opportunity just for saving the environment or stop the traffic and noise on the streets .while everyone knows that cars seriously pollute the air noone would stop using them for that reason , because they are not able to see the consequences of that pollution directly or do not recognize them .all at all , there wo nt be fewer cars in the future and in twenty years we have to expect an even bigger number than today .
