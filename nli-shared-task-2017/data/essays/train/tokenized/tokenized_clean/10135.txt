the question about hiring a tour guide or not when traveling to a new place can raise a controversy .on the one hand , you know what to expect when taking a tour .on the other hand , you would totally depend on the guide s timing , schedules and particular inclinations to visit some places and leave others aside .i believe traveling in a group led by a tour guide leaves no room to particular experiences while traveling .it can not be denied that tours are organized and save time as they know where to go and what would be the most efficient itinerary do do so .as they know the places , they wo nt waste time asking for directions or going to `` famous empty spots  listed on travel guides .this is a great advantage as available time to travel is usually very limited .however , due to time constrains , tour-guides usually limit the visits to landmarks and leave aside important things as beautiful landscapes or `` live-experiences  .in fact , time is so short that many interesting things are seen from the window of a bus .it must be very frustrating to go to paris to hear a tour guide saying `` on your left is the louvre museum  instead of actually visiting it .moreover , traveling in a tour-guide led group is far more expensive than traveling on your own , thus limiting the posibilities of many people to do so .in addition , if you liked a particular spot , for instance the louvre museum , you do nt have the flexibility to stay longer , but instead you re limited by inflexible schedules .in conclusion , i believe that even if traveling in a tour guide led group can be more time efficient that doing so on your own , it s expensive , inflexible and limiting .a better experience can be held by traveling on your own , provided that a prior assessment and good planning of the trip are done .
