being a successful person makes yourself responsable on maintaining that success in many different aspects .i completely agree on the fact that successfull people should try new things and take risk because it will give the person confidence , experience , knowlegde , independence among other characterics that a successful person should have and never forget .one point in favour is that successful people should try new things to get experience even in things that have anything to do with their area of success .in fact , a successful person has usually studied before and has a good level of education and experience on its field to achive her o his success correctly .for example , a successful colombian singer who goes to music school in colombia and then goes to a music academy in india will have not only the knowledge of indian music but the experience of being in another country surrounded with a different culture and people .furthermore , this will give the colombian singer a range of new ideas that will probably be reflected in new styles of music , lyrics that he or she will manage to learn and use due to the experience of being in india .another point to support the importance of taking risk is the fact that you never know what is going to happen in the future .taking a risk being successful helps already because of the prestige that your name already has .for instance , my dad to the risk of quiting his last job because he wanted an independent company even thou he had a good salary .however , he manage to create his new coal company with old working partners that he met during a conference in last job where he was very successful as the general administrator of a marine port .his success and popularity in his last job helped him after many years to gain the confidence and trust of new working partners .finally , to maintain success you have to take risks in life
