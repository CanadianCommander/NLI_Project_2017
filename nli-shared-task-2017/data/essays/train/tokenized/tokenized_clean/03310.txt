some people like to travel in a group tour led by a tour guide , but others like to travel as they like without a tour guide .i definitely like the latter types of travel .if you travel in a tour , your schedule are usually already decided .it is good for some people because they do not need to worry about the places they go and the transportation they need to take to get each place .however , the tour schedule might not include the specific places where they really want .also , as for the time , if they want to stay a place longer , or if they happen to find a place where they want to stop by on the way of the tour , they can not do that in a tour .when traveling not in a tour , i think people can enjoy the place and the culture there more .when i went to australia to travel from japan by myself , i needed to speak english all the time , but it was great chances for me to talk with local people directly .in the tour , usually the tour guide takes the responsibilities for everything , and you have less chances to contact local people and stop by the local and small stores and restaurant .also , if you do not join the tour , you even do not have to decide the schedule beforehand .you can just do whatever you want and go wherever you feel after you get to the place .you can ask the recommendations to the local people or other travelers  there .from my experience , i think there are many small but good places where the regular tour do not visit .it might be nice to join a tour when you want to travel but you do not want to think anything and just follow somebody .however , i think the travel is kind of an adventure , and that it is one of the fun parts in the travel to think and plan the places where i go and the schedule for my own trip .
