i entirely agree with this statement due to the following factors :first of all , i think that fuel will become more expensive and for many people it will be hard to afford going by car .another reason why i think that there will be fewer cars in the future is because of the high pollution and the smog in the world , which is mostly produced by the car drivers .nowadays there are also far too many cars on the street .there is a lot of traffic ervey day and parking spots are quite limited in several areas .sometimes it would be much faster to go by public transport than to go by car and try to find a parking spot .because of these masses of cars on the street the pollution will just increase .all these factors mentioned above should encourage the people to stop driving and start going by public transport .but evidently they do nt !fuel can get more expensive and more expensive , but the people are still driving more than ever .i still think that the numbers of cars in use will be reduced .not by the people itself , but by restrictions of the government .in my opinion it is the duty of the government to prevent the country from more pollution and smog .i am sure that in the next ten years there will be quite a few suggestions from the government trying to limit the number of cars .it will not be a very easy task for them , because they will have to convince the people who are used to driving a car to go by public transport or maybe just to walk .i think for most of the people not being able to go by car anymore will be a loss of their freedom and flexibilty .it will be important to show them the alternatives and also to build up a strong publich transport , where you are as flexible and free as in a car .i know that it wo nt be easy to reduce the number of cars , but i think it is a task to be done in order to keep the world a clean place and i am sure that it will be done !
