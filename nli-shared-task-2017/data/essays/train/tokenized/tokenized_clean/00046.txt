some people agree this statemant that there will use cars for twenty yers .on the other hand some people dis agree this statement .in my case , i agree this statemant .in this essay , i ll gice two reasons to supprt my essay .first of all , i think that the cars is not good for environment about the earth .for example , now the earth have some problems to warm atomother .in my regions where are near the sea have some problem , it is that rasing the sea point .this problems occer some place thouthout earth .this problems was occered by people s tools such as cars .so i think that people should reduce to use some tools sach as cars .second of all , the cars are so danger .some people occer the attacking between cars .for instance , in fact i exprienced to feel danger for the cars .when i was high school student , i was attacked by the car that ride people who diank alcohole .so this problem like the my accident happened many places .so i think the goverment will say the people who out the low not to use cars .besides i think the new tools will bear more useful and non dengerous in twenty years .so the cars willuse fewer than todays .in conclusion , i agree this opinion .in fact the cars are very useful .however they so dengerous .so i think that the cars less useful nowadays because so dangerous for people and the earth .therefore , i agree this statement
