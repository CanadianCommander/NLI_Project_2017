i agree with the statement that people these days are not devoting much time to help their communities .including many other reasons tenological advancement is mainfirst of all , these days peple are becoming more and more isolated .they keep engaged with online friends who are countries apart and dont know who their neighbors are .and if they dont know the members of his/her community how can one expect he will have the feeling to help out them in need .also , technical advances have have made him more confident that he wo nt require help from his community so he is also reluctant out his community as well .for instance if a person has got an injury while doing some task at home he knows that he is just a phone call away from hosital , an ambulance will be at his house in just few minutes after the call .he dont require any help from his community members to help him out of this grave situation .furthermore these days people are too busy in their hectic , superpaced and hightech lives that they even dont have time to think about other .for instance , a typical youth is busy in his projects , classes , seminars and to add on this his partime or weekend job , and a child rather than playing with other kids in park after completing his homework prefers to play computer or video games .how can one exopect that they can help their community members ?finally the growth in competiton has forced humans to aviod helping their community members , for eg a student would not wish to give his notes to another student because that frightents him that he may joepardise his chance of getting higher rank .to sum up the tecnological advances , competition among the community members themselves , and their busy lives all are the reasons for a person being reluctant towards his/her community members .
