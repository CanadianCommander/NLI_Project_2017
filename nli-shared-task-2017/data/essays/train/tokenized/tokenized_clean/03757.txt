i do not agree the opinion of that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities .i argue that this opinion is not true for tree reasons .first , i think that all youngers are living by suporting each other .though my experience , my friends always helped me when i got troubles .even i was supported by my fliends more than my friends .i can say that if i did not have any friends , i could not get over the so many problems that i had in the past .of course when my friends are in trouble , i try to help them .we have learned the importance of frieds and support each other freom thouse experiences .secound , in the public , i see so many young people who helps eldery people .for example , people give up their seats and give them to old people on trains , buses or on any public ridings .in addition , some people carry havy bags for eldery people in stores .tired , in my school , when someone breake his legs , arround his friends help him by carring his stuffs or leading him .or when someone is appcent , his friend takes notes for him .i believe that all young people know the importance of helping other people and everybody helpes their communities .
