earlier people used to study and by-heart their topics in order to gain high grades in exams .those who scored high were praised for their hard work and effort.a student gaining the highest was considered to be more knowledgeable and the most brilliant of all .those ones who devoted lesstime in studying and more time in thinking wre thought to be less sincere .gradually the trends changed .hence a drastic change occured and more attention began to be paid to research tasks and the pace of understanding the conceptual factors related to a particular topic .this opened the minds of many creative people .this sense of understanding slowly began to establish even among school going children so as to ponder about what topics had they learnt , how and why a respective phenomena occured etc .it is not always necessary that learning a specific chapter will help an individual to enhance the skills required .a particular memorised lesson ca nt prve to be the boon to answer the questions during exams unless we posess the thorough concept of the related subject .dedicated hard work in creating a conceptual underatanding pays a lot as compared to the mugged-up tasks learnt in aless period of time .albert einstein is a brilliant example in this regard .he had been punished by his history teacher during his childhood because he had never been interested in studying the past unless knowing the proofs to certify the previous events .he shared the same feeling with that teacher as he was not interested in learning the gone istead of innovating new and apt ideas .hence his strong capability to think made if fa famous scientists of the time .so inculcating profound thoughts into our minds in place of memorising can help us to attain better knowledge and create a global and broad approach in any sphere of knowledge .
