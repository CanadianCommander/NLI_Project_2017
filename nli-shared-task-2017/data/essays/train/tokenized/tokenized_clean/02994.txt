i completely agree with the statement , and i quote here ,  it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i am comming to that opinion because facts treat a very limited area of importance , while ideas can be transfered from one case to another .for example if i know when a famous person was borne it doesnt help me if i have to write an essay about exactly that specific time .inspite of that it would help me if i understood in which way that person influenced the world or which idea he spread .another point is that in my experience learning facts is very boring and you do not remember them for a very long time .ideas are much more interesting because they are more complex and have a brought background which causes the need to deal with the subject and thus are remembered for a longer time .for instance i had history class in school in which i had to learn many facts and it was the class i did not like the most .i was taking bioligy classes as well and i liked them best because of those complex and intensive structures which were introduced .actionly a very important aspect of supporting ideas not facts is that you can learn masses of facts without abstracting them and without understanding there meaning , belonging or their causes and effects .ideas show you the bigger connection between things and offer the possibility of understanding why things happended or will happen in future .for example imagine a polititian who is holding a speech .he will tell you some facts and actions he plans .thats the one side but you have no clue why he wants to realise his plans , maybe there is a hidden reason for him , think at hitlers coming up .this brings me to the next point .facts are just a part of a bigger thing .so people can be tricked by showing them wrong or just a part of the facts .ideas motivate people to invent and develope them , to thing by themselves which makes tricking more complicated .for example hitler came to power because he told the people facts they wanted to here and which they apreciated , but he rejected some major facts and the idea behind all of his actions so that people had a wrong impression of him and his plans .so comming to a conclusion there are serveral aspects which leed me to the desicion that ideas are more important than facts .not only that people are limited in their ability of independent thinking when they just get to know the facts they might even not be able to understand bigger contextes or just do not want to deal with a subject because they are not interested .
