many peolpe have one or even more cars .in todays time they have become very important to many people and they can not miss them anymore .i do not agree with the statement : in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .in my oppinion ther will not be many disadvanatges of cars in the future anymore .there will be other sources of energie for cars that neither would be so bad for the environment nor would they be so expensive as energie is today .as a result , many people would like to drive their car just because it is fun .because driving a car will be extremly secure in twenty years , there will be other types of cars invented that will be used just for fun .even poor people will be able to drive a car just for fun .driving in a car would be much more comfortable than it is today .in addition to that there will be a better system of streets ; as a result , there will not be so much traffic anymore .so all in all there will not be many disadvantages left .in twenty years the peolpe will be more bussy than today .therefore they will need the car to move fast from one point to another .it will be very important to have a perfect time-management .the peolpe also will use the car in other ways as today .they will use their car for meetings with other people or to have a braek and eat something in the car .in my oppinion the car will play another role in the whole live of the people .all these arguments support my oppinion , and show why i do not agree with the statement .the car is very important to many people today and because of the development of the problem , not to have enough time , it will be impossible to miss the car for the most people .as a result , there will be many cars in twenty years .
