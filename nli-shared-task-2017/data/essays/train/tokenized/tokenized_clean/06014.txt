if you have a choice to travel around the country , will you go along by yourself or travel in a group ead by a tour guide ?as for me , i will take the second answer and i believe this the best way to use in the travel , for the following reasons :first and fore most , traveling in a group and accompanied by a tour guide gives me more knowledge and pleasure in my tour .compare to travelling alone , the tour guide may tell us more background information , stories of the sighting and also introduces many local cultrual matters or traditional habits .these great information certainly enhences my trip and makes me be knowledgalbe to where i have been visited .in addition , it is suah a good way to use my money and time wisely in the tour .travelling in a group will absolutely save my money and time .for instance , other group members and i share the same bus , we book the hotel with lower price and our schedule is highly planed before we go .thes significant parts offers me a more economic travel than my travelling alone .last but not the least , it makes me meeting a lot of new friends in my tour group and my travel is full of fun .it is benificial for travelling together with others rather than by oneself alone simply because i make friend with our group members and share the happiness with them .in a conclusion , travelling in a group and being led by a tour guide is the best way to experience and enjoy my tour .
