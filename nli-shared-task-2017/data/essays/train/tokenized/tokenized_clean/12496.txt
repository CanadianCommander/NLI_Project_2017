i will support the idea that young people are more happy than older people .the first reason is that people in their twentys for example usually have less health problems and more energy .they are at their physical heights , strong , and beautifull !they can go out late at night and wake up early the next day without feeling too much pain .another reason is that young people still have hope .hope in a brighter future for the world , hope in a brighter future for themselves .they beleive , and they are theoritically right , that everything is still possible in the world and in their life , and this contributes greatly to their happiness .every day a new life can begin .as a counter example , i have a friend , 40 years old , who has been a technician for the twenty first years of his career , despite the fact that he didn nt really like technical jobs .he always thought his job was just for a living and that he would nt do that all his life .but recently , when he wanted to finally change job and work in business , he just could nt find a single employee that aws interested in his profile .he was very depressed about the idea of spending the rest of his life doing something he did nt really like .whereas for young people , it is easier to change job .finally , young people have less reponsibilities than older people , therefore they are less likely to suffer from stress than older people .their job , their familly life , and their belongings are not as important as they will be in their future .plus , their decisions usually involve only them , therfore increasing the satisfaction that they can get from life .they can more or less decide according to whatever they feel is good for them , without having to find a compromise with a loved one or childrens .for instance , if they do not have a family , they can decide to go and work abroad if they have a great opportunity , which is not so easy to do for someone that lives with his wife or husband .as a conclusion , even though there are many benefits to growing old , young people enjoy more life than older people .but after all , being young is in people s minds !
