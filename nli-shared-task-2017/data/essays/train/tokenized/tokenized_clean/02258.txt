i disagree with the stated idea .i think there will be more cars in use in twenty years from now .cars have been one of the indispensible transportation since they were invented .and even though there have been many other transportation systems were developed , such as subway and airplanes , cars never been out of people s life .instead of being replaced by other transportation systems , they have changed to better versions contionously .moreover , some people are very interested in buying or collecting old versions of popular cars , like classic model of `` beatle  .cars may be considered just as a means of moving .but purposes of owing a car has changed over time , and nowadays some want cars to show their life style and personalities .for this reason , there will be more cars in the future .however , it s possible that new and better means of transporting will be invented in the future , but i believe that cars will be developed to be a better means than now .as we ve been doing this for a long time , we can find better resources for power , and also better designs for cars .also there will be more cars considering peole s tastes today .living in a modern world , many people prefer to stay private wherever possible and want to feel at home whenever possible .in that point , cars are the best way to choose .i predict that fancier , more comfortable , faster , and safer means of moving than cars will appear in twenty years .even if it happens , i d choose to stay with my own car .cars have been one of the most attractive things people can have , and i believe people wo nt be able to resist the urge of buyig a new car and driving on the streets .
