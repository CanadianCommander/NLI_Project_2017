nowadays it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .is it true or not ?to come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today .at the past before the technological improvements there were lots of things which a humanbeing was not able to do alone .for example think about not having any washingmachine .when we think about the times that the female humanbeing must be doing all the houseworks .at these times families are much more crowded and as a result people have to wash much more clothes .washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a women , all the other young people has to help their mother to have clean clothes .but now almost all of us have washingmachines in our house .when somebody in the family have dirty clothes he  she do nt have to call anybody .he  she puts clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready .year by year the population of the world is increasing .there not too much places to work and earn money .at the sum people prefer having small families such as parents and one child to have good life conditions according to their money .at the old times people were usually making farm work .when you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you , the more product you will have .because of that people used to prefer having crowded families .and when a child has brothers and sisters it has to be social and help the others to have something to eat , to earn money or to have clothes to wear .finally by the improvement of technology , life is much more easier but technology makes youngsters selfish .young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies .
