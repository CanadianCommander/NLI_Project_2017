i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .these days , many young people are just playing around and some of them are even being obstacle to others .in my country , japan , the unemployed young people is being a serious problem .they are the people who never goes outside and work .they often get food supplies and hobby goods from their parents .these people are surely not helping their communities , since they just spend most of the time playing computer games .i have a friend that used to play a lot in childhood , but now that friend is staying in his house for all the day and doing nothing .that friend s mother was saying that it would be great if he get out from his room and start searching for job , since the family s income is not sufficient .there is other case too .some young people in japan spend their time just running around their neighbourhoods with their motorcycles , usually with a very noisy sound of that motorcycles .they can be very hostile and causes a lot of fights .by those fights , public property could be destroyed , or other people might get injured too .i got injured by those people last week .i was just standing in the park , waiting for my friend , and those people came saying that the park is their place , so never enter .they punced me in face , and i was badly injured .young people should be the ones who help and develop their communities , but it is not yet achieved in my country .i think those people who are being obstacle to others should stop harming other people or destroying public property at first .then gradually , they can be helping their communities and could make it better .
