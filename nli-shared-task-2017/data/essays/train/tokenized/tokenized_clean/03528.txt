according to my opinion , specilize in one specific subject is better than the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .student need knowledge in one specilize subject will give good and positive reaults to him .he would get confidence on that particular subject .specilize subject gives chance to get more knowledge , grip and command on that particular subject .they mey get more chances to focus on particular thing , it will help to reserch on that specialized subject .it leads to invent new product , it may help to moderen society .also it may give good name and also chances to improve economical position .for example , i finished my specialization in pharmaceutical division .after that i did reaserch work on one particular molecule .that molecule given positive result against hiv disease .i got a huge amount of prize money from my country .and also they awarded in many ways .with this prized money i started a one large pharmaceutical company .in other way many people are serviving with my medicine .this results given good name in my career .another example is , one of my frieds also specilize in the computer programm .he invented a new programm , for that he awarded by the government .due to that programm people are enjoying computar games and internet fecility .due to internt the world become a small village .finally , my opinion is specialize in many acdemic subjects will not foucus in one particular thing , he may not get satisfaction with all subjects .didnt get special recognisation in society .so specialize in one specific subject is better .many scientiest are invented by specialize in one specific subject .
