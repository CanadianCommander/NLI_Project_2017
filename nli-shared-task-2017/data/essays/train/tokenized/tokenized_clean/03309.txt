i think advertisements give us a different image of a product .this is possible because advertisements always manage to affect our mind and our imagination through television and newspaper .they modify our perception of a product bulding an entire world around a simple object .when we watch an add on the tv , we never pay attention to what is advertised .we are caught by slogans and images .sometimes we do nt even see the product itself being showed .so , we just remeber the name of the firm and sometimes the catchy melody that accompanied the add .television usually advertises brands , not products .that s way we may not get a proper idea of what we are going to buy .in newspapers products are often advertised by movie or sport stars .in that case , we stare at the picture of the star and do nt notice the product .we associate that good to a character of the show business .in this way we do nt care of what we intend to buy , but whom we are going to look like after we bought it .we look at images , not goods .both pictures and tv commercials are now made by very famous artists .we are attracted to the advertisements for themselves .it seems to me that the more an advertisement is tempting and promising , the more talent is required to hide the real nature of the object .the beauty of an add obscures our idea of the product .advertisements are aimed to built a web around a product .a chain of associations that must influence our behavior as consumers .to make us buy something that maybe we are not going to like and enjoy .television , internet and newspapers all offer a great and profitable way to accomplish this goal .
