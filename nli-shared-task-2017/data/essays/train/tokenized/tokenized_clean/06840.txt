taking risks to be more successful or keeping the current success level not to fall down , not changing their business style is crutial questions to business leaders .i strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first of all , in a business world , self-achievement is considered the most effecitve faactors to motivate wokers .setting their own goal by themselves , planning to achieve the goal , and assess their achievement by themselves is done by the workers .if the assessment is enough for the boss to approve , the workers can promote .in the world famous car company toyota , this system works well .it will cultivate workers  enegy toward their working and produce a lot of suceessful people .second , being creative the key to success .sometimes cocnservative people want to keep the current style , especially if their business is going well .howver , the time and the world are changing .today s novelty is not attracitve next year in some business foield .being brave to make a decision to create a new plan based on analytical thought and precise reserach of the market will lead to the real success .when these theory is accepted , workers have no doubt to be successful themselves .third , cooperation is also key to be successful .if the company keep the current business , everyboday can do his job individually .however , once the company decides to challenge a new project , relationship in a team is the essential .cooeration is necessary .as i mentioned above , in either as the individual or the company , trying a new things amd taing risks will challengin and bring some effect .i agree only people who are brave to challenge can be successful .
