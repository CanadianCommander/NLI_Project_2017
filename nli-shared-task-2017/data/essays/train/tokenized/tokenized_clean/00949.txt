although there are several advantages of a broad knowledge , i prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area .first of all , i have got the opinion that your chances concerning getting a job are better when you are specialized .if you have studied business , for instance , with a specialization or main topic like chinese language and its global features , you will become more interessting for a range of special companies .you have the advantage to separate you from the mass of other students or applicants .therefor zour chances are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that has got close connections to china .however , if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subjects and areas , it could become more difficult to find the right job .there are no specific positions in a company that would fit to you .there is of course no doubt , that education is really important and broad knowledge is always be a good basis .but concerning the job market it is probably not enough .especially today , it is pretty hard and exhausting to find a job in germany .you have to offer special skills and educations to get the chance of a good job .according to this , people should concentrate on subjects where they can provide necessary skills and which they like to do .normally , that is only a small and limited area of a subject , in business , for example management and not the whole subject which would also includes financing for example , a completely different area .concerning the knowledge you are learning or using in private , i think it is an advantage to have broad knowledge and to be educated .in conclusion , i support the point of specializing in a subject to improve your chances getting a job in being more unique .
