do young people not give enough time to helping the communities they belong ?i think young people pays a lot of time to their own communities .moreover , they has a healthy mind than others .first of all , teenagers have more time to do something helping the communities .i think that adult works all day and maybe they do nt have many times to help other because they are too tired .in my school , there are many vulenteers help the old men who has no sons and daughters .one of my friends go to the old men s home and cooks lunch and dinner for them everyday and read the books and newspaper for them if she has free time .in addition , young people s power is always stronger than others  and they are tenacity .as the proverb says , a healthy body brees a healthy mind .for example , about two months ago , there was a terrible cat-abuse news on tv .the bad guy bit the little kitty on his home s window side and put the picture on the website .at the time , a lot of teenagers found every apartment all over the country which has the white window looks like the picture on the blog .finally , some young people found the bedman s house and saved ten kitties .because the young people has a healthy body that who can fight and conflict to the man who abused cat and help the news be know by many people .to sum up , the teenagers help their own communities more than others .
