i agree with the statement .first , in the tour we can make new friends .in my case , this summer i went kamikouchi by tour , and then i could make lot of friends .fathremore , i was able to get the information of other tour from the new friends , and next summer i will go with them .second , we can go trip without preparing , even the place we do nt know .forexanple , if we wish to go egypt and we do nt have any information of egypt , maybe we can not find the way to go egypt with own our self .but if we join the tour , tour guide will get information for us and introduce lot of place in there .in addition i can go trip alone .i do not have to find friends who are intrested to the same place .all i have to do is choose the place to trip and find the tour to complete my hope .so , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
