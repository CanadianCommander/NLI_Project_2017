over centuries , starting almost with the founding of the first universities , the ideal of a completely educated person was dominant on the european continent - somebody who masters ancient languages as good as he is at natural sciences or even the arts .and on the other end of the line ?there was the specialist , soley focused on his subject , almost an idiot in his single-mindedness .but the times have changed .with todays fast growing amount of scientific knowlege and the fast pace of research - new findings published almost every day - no one can know everything these days anymore .so the specialist , who was laughed at only 150 years ago , seems now to be the ideal of an educated person .however i think one should try to take the best parts of both educational ideals for oneself .and my suggestion to make this possible , is not to try to gain broad and specific knowledge at the same time , but one after the other .during primary and secondary school there is plenty of time to teach the students different subjects and viewpoints .even if it seems to be a waste of time because there wo nt be an opportunity to use the attained things later on , it will still widen the students mind and help him organizing things s/he learns later on .for example , when i went to secondary school , i was taught latin and ancient greek - which both do nt serve much purpose in todays world , but it helped me not only to study french and spanish easily but also told me a lot about european history and mythology , what is quite important for job i do now .on the other side , when somebody enters university or has already studied some years , it s time to take a decision and choose a subject or a focus for his graduate time .because of the above mentioned imense amount of available knowledge , this focusing on one field is propably the only way to be really good at it .( which again is in my opinion the main party in doing something ) .so my ideal is somebody who has a broad basis of knowledge , which makes him able to decide , based on the broad basis , in which subject he wants to specialise in later .
