when the education s reforms hit the headline of the newspapers it is a strenous effort to know if it is more important for the young student to learn facts or understand ideas and concepts .with the benefit of insight , i suppose both have advantages and you can not separate one from the other .on the one hand , the schoolchildreen have to learn fact in oder to make their meaning to understand complex situation as the die and the birth .you could not have the possibility to write or to tell something without vocabulary or idea wich you learn in your youth .there are four steps in the developement of the childreen , and you do not become an adult if you do not learn specifics facts in this steps .on the other hand , you do not spend all the times of your life in learnning facts .in previous years after your schoolyears you will not learn some facts but only understand ideas and concepts in order to analyse them , and discover a solution .for example a searcher in an institute of medecine , had spent time in books to learn facts as a student .but , when he take time on fundamental experience like research on a.i.dsvirus he spend more time to understand it complex structure than learn about the fact he exist .to put in a nutshell , the student and te adult when they are not student spend time in undestand ideas and concepts and learn facts .on the whole , i am firmly convinced that all the time in your life you learn and trie to understand concepts or informations .owing to world change evryday at evrytime .you have to focus on all informations if you want to do not be drop out the society .
