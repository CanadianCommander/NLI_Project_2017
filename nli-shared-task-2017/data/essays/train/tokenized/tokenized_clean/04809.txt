while it is true that some people prefer not to take risks and experiment new things , someother believe that only those who dare exploring the unknown and continously improving themselves can acheive `` success  .i think that the successful people are required to try new things and take risk , because their knowledge may get outdated in a short time .let s take the example of fashion .fashion is continously shifting and it is always changing according to the mass requests .if a successful stylist would persist producing the same kind of products after a fashion shift , he would bankrupt in no time as noone would be interested .other cases of successul people can be scientist : what would be of humanity if scientist did nt make their experiment or tried unbelievable theories ?the whole science is a always-changing subjuct as modern science differs heavily from just 50 years ago science .in this very field we have great names such as heinstein who carried out his experiment of the relativity in phisics , or bell who could invent the phone only by trying different hypothesis in the radiowaves sector .one of the most striking example is the technology field , especially the computer evolution : computers power doubles every 18 months , and the software is always more and more hungry of resources .would you consider possible some of the great mathematics achievement , or , on the other hand , some befautiful 3d film , without the growing calcolus power of the computer , obtained by continued research ?in this field as well we can hear very big names , like bill gates , steve jobbs or linus torvalds , who were enabled to provide us with their great operating systems ( microsoft windows , apple macos x and linux ) only by going against what they already knew and trying hard new solutions .in conclusion , the key for success is obtainable only by hard work in experimenting new theories and only by will to continue renewing oneself s knowledge .
