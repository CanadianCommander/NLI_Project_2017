how to be a creative person ?it is really tough to answer to it since everybody knows that the result of any creation has to be appreciated and approuved by other peolpe .therefore , it does not only depends on our personal feeling .well , it is not a good raison of evoiding to try new things instead of keeping doing well what we already know how to do .in the following paragraph , i am going to give illustrate and give arguments according to my point of view .with the evolution of new technology and the growth of the global market , competitions between people and other entities are increasing .hence the need of releasing new things in order to remain in fashion or be more competitive .all this can happen only by trying new things .what the domain of competency , you would need to put in place new attractive things .as illustration , let s talk about cellphones .mobile phones companies allways release new type of device , and this just because they have try new technology instead of doing or trading the same model .futhermore , if go back in the past , we will realize that all discoveries made by scientists , physicians , biologists and so on , have been possible because they haved tryed new things , new concepts , new experiences .all can see the result today : we hace electricity , cars , aircrafts , tablets and medecins , water and so on .all that make our today s life , better to live .therefore , i encourage people , whatever their social life , their occupation and their personality , to take a risk and try new things .this can contribute to the development our world and their own partuculary .we can not stay in the same way , for all our time we are going to spend on this earth , with taking any risk by putting in place new things .we just need to try , and one day we will get a good result .
