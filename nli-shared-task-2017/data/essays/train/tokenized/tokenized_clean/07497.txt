on the one hand , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a tremendous asset because we can say when we apply for a job that we are polyvalent .this is well valued by employers because we will be able to evoluate in many different fields , services in the firm .many business schools deliver marketing , financial , linguistic skills which can be used in different posts in a firm .and this is a security for students who do not have a specific project for the future .but after all those advantages , there is one major drawback which is that the student only know few things about many subjects .indeed , only basics skills can be treated when this is not a specialized subject .so the student will be penalize against a specialized student .on the other hand , to be specialized in one specific subject is the best choice for students who have a clear idea of what job they want to exerced in the future .they can say to the employers that they are the best in one particular subject .this is very good way to apply for a job .firms need the best .multinational firms put in competition students over the world , so being specialized in finance when you want to apply for a job at price water and house is required .its is impossible for someone who have only basic skills in audit .the disadvantage is that if the company wants to put us in an other service , which is not our specialisation , we will have to do trainings , formation , or at least to learn alone with our own experience .this is more stressful and very risked .so this a thorny problem for a student .to tackle this issue , we have to compare the strenghts and weaknesses of each education like i have done .there is one solution adapted to each cases .then , we have to know if a job in specific interest us .if this is the case , we have to specialized in the subject appropriated to apply for this job .anyway , in our studies , we are never totally specialized in something .there is always a few basic skilled mastered .and this is a good thing because polyvalence if very appreciated by employers .
