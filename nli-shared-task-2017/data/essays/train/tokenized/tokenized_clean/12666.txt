without hardwork and risks , we cant succeed in our life .i totally agree with the statement .only by doing some new things , we can invent something new in this world . .alonso was f1 formula race winner last time .he tried new things in the track , through that he won the tournament .he got lots of risks but finally he won the touranmentthat is important .every field needs news things to done .in the medicine field , every successful scientist need to do some new things .only then they can invent some new drugs .by doing already known things that will help us to do the particular thing perfectly .but by trying new things it gives some suceess in our life .for example , once michael sczhumager was succesful man in f1 formula race .but , last time he didnt performed well and he has been replaced by alonso russian driver .main reason for his failure was ferrari formula car , because he havent tried his drive with other engines like mclaren , tata etc .thats why he couldnt win last tournament .till there is no drug found to cure hiv virus .people who have completed their doctarate in this domain , they need to research on new things regarding to this disease , only then its possible to find drug for this disease .only by trying new things , victories , new invention can be made .thats why most of the successful person tries with new things rather than only doing what they already know .
