people have their own idea whether youth do not give much time to help their neighborhoods .some people may say that in these days , some young people do not have enough time to help others .in my opinion , however , young people do not give time to help others : they focus on their own things and they are more busy than past younger .first , young people have to concentrate on only their works .it is generally agreed that young people can not avoid any competitions such as have a job or enter the university .therefore , young people do not have enough time to help other people .for example , if they do not focus on their tasks , they can not survive in modern society .having a job is the very important thing in their life .they must think only their works for their future .in this way , younger people can not have time to help others .second , modern society makes young people busy .some people might think that young people have a lots of spare time such as vacations .however , lots of people enjoy their life at an early age because if they get older they can not have much time to enjoy their life .for instance , young people make plan at long vacation .they can go abroad or thay can study other major which young people want to learn .in this way , young people nowadays can not spend their spare time helping their communities .to sum up , young people do not have time to help their communities .they have a lot things to do and they must enjoy their time when they are young .all things considered , i can definetely say that youth have difficulty in having time to help their neighbors .
