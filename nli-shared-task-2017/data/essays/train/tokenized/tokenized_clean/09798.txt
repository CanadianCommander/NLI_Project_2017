i m in agreement with this statement for three principal reasons .firstly , the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty years will be much more expehensive than is today .that is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 years and the territories with a lot of oil are instable .in this situation there will be a lot of people who could nt effort the oil and conseguently who wo nt buy the car .secondly , there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the cities .this phenomen that is has already happened in europe and america is happening at this period in africa e asia .more people will live in the cities e fewer cars in use there will be .that is becouse the people who live in the cities couse traffic or couse public transport facilities have a less percentual of cars respect the people who live in the countryside .and lastly , there is another problem for who has got a car : when you finish to use it you have to park it !and in the big cities couse parking restrictions or lack of space it s often difficult to park it .for these three reasons , cost of energy , urbanization and problems of parking i belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
