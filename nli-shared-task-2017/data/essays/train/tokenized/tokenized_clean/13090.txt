i strongly disagree with the statement .it is not possible to establish a general rule as to whether the age of a person determines the intensity in which this person enjoys his life or not .to evaluate the statement against real life , we would need to understand how do we establish who is young or old , where the frontier is , or , if what the statement is saying is that the ability to enjoy life is directly related to age , for instance : does a person of 37 years old enjoys life more than a person of 36 ?in what proportion ?( - 100 ) * (( 36/37 ) - 1 ) ?the extent to which life is enjoyed ca nt be accurately measured and should be determined individually , independently of age .as a person of 28 years old , i have met friends and colleagues that enjoy far less their lives than , let s say , my mother , and she is 60 .while they are working 14 hours a day and spending most of their weekends sleeping and resting for a demanding week , my mother travels around the world , visits different places and enjoys a lot of activities that are commonly thought to be exclusive for young people .activities like surfing , playing tennis or soccer are enjoyed around the world by a lot of people above 60 years old .on the other hand , i have also met people around the 70 s , like my uncle , that are only sitting in their chairs waiting for death as well as friends around 25 that live their lives to the maximum possible and are always looking for opportunities for fun and joy .giving the above , how can we define if age has anything to do with the way life is enjoyed ?i believe that age has nothing to do with the level of joy and true happiness , and that none aside for oneself can determine they way one enjoys life .i could say that my brother , who spends most of his life surfing , does nt enjoy life because with no money on his wallet he ca nt buy new things , eat in fine restaurants and go to different places because he ca nt pay for gasoline , the truth is that if we would get to ask him , he d respond that he has enjoyed life more than anyone in the world .in conclusion , i do nt think one can establish a general rule to determine who enjoys life the most .i would leave that question to be answered by each person .
