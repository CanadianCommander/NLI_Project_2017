some people have an idea that young people have a lot of time to give hands to their communities .however , others think that youngers , these days , do not have enough time to accomodating the communities they are living .in my opinion , to young people , time is lack to helping their communites becasue of their educating and more options for spending their free time .to begin with , nowadays , many parents believe that education is the most important point to their children .therefore , they make their children concentrate on only studying .to be specific , my sister who is high school student spend a lot of time on studying .after finishing her class in the school , she go to the english and science institution .when she come back to the home , it is always about 11 aclock in the night .as a result , if many younges want to contribute to their communites , they do not have time to care about the helping the communites .in additon , aroud the young peole , there are many attrative options to spend their time except studying .these attractive places interrupt to helping the communities .in my city , there are many theaters and amusement parks .also , by developing the internet , young people often play games and chat with friends in the online .for example , my cousin who is 17 yeas old thinks that playing on line game is only a resort to spend his free time , he told to me playing the game is more intersesting than helping his community .in brief , i firmly beleive that now , young peole do not use their time to working at their communites , because their parents let them focus on only their studies .as a result , they are extreamly busy .also , if they have a little time , youngers do other things like going to the theaters or other places and playing on line game rather than sharing work for their communities .if you are a busy student because of your study , which one will you choose between going to theater to watch exciting movies and working for your community ?
