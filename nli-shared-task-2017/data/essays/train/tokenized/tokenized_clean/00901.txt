i agree with this statment because in the future less people will obtain cars due to the advanced technology in the mechanical feild which might produce new inventions that might be easier to use , safer for the enviroment , has a lesser consumption of fossil fuel and doesnt cause traffic jams which is a major problem faced by our community today .cars now adays are a major head ache to the people who live in developed cities due to the traffic jam caused by them .this started making some scientists to think of macking hay while the sun shines by building flying cars which could have special air tracks and traffic signals which will stop the traffic jam .ofcourse they are still working on the project trying to minimize as possible the cars price to offer opportunities to major people to buy this kind of cars .many goverments started thinking of building under grount trains that also will fasilitate the decrease in traffic jam and at the same time provide convinience to the people who use them as thy will make them reach to their wanted place in a lesser time due to their high speed and it makes them also save a lots of money as they dont have to pay for petrol or cars maintanence .not to mention that the trains tickets pice will be very low .other goverments like in china enhance the people living their to use bycicles to go all around the city by macking special tracks and signals only for bycicle users not to mention the secial parking rods that are placed in front of each building to make it much more esier for the people over there to park their bycicles safely and head on to their jobs .in conclusion the use of cars in the future will be alot lesser than now adays with the help of our goverments and scientists who are really working hard to give out their best to reach our comfort .
