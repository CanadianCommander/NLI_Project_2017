this question are very difficult , i mean that now are different the style of life that in the past .for this are false a credential that now the young people not give enought time to helping their comunity .for my experience in the past the young people has less time to think at the communities why at the age of 14 ears the children grow up in a man , he are forced to do to work , he are forced to help his family and he has not many times for the communities .now the society are completly different the children go to school so mutch that the past , and he has a different means .i speak for the personal experience i m going to the social group ans i help the childrens to make a home works and to have a great space et time to play with a friend .for me are really special to help a childrens in her formation and i like to continue in my work for few year .are really too , that now is very difficult to reclute a children , normally are in her house with a video games and the grandparent .after this with a friend s group i m going , in a little part now , with a exame and the university i have less time to spend whit her , in a meeting and convetion that speak about books , theatre , and cinema .this too in a minor part increase the aspect of integration with a communities .but are rare to have other person and other friend that make the same way that i cross , now the style of live think at the individual person and to grow up your personality , in difficult to see lot of person that help other . ..but not all word are the same .in the end i dont have a great answer i has describe my situation but are very difficult comparize the same aspect in different sociology and culture era .
