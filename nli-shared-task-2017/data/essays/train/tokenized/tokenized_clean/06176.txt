man has invented various modes of transport , right for very invention of the wheel , to move from one place to another .the want to reach his destination faster and easier has made him invent machines and roads that would serve his purpose .the car , an invention of the 19th century , has brought in a paradigm shift in the way he travels from one place to another .today , a car has become a part of modern world that it would be difficult to imagine commuting to work or going on a holiday on your own with your family without a car .i for one would nt agree to the statement that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use that there are today .though , almost all cars of today run on gasoline , which is a fast depleting resource , we have developed technology to aid us find oil reserves both in the deep seas as well as in the middle of the dessert .also , some japanese car manufactures like honda has invented hybrid cars that run on alternate fuels like hydrogen .these cars are known to be very eco-friendly and not emitting the polluting gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as in the case of internal combustible cars of today .though hybrid cars are expensive being a very recent invention , over the years , these would be accessible to people at large at affordable prices .thus , the problem of for oil & gas reserves would become less important .moreover , due to the large number of cars , we do face other problems like noise pollution and heavy vehicular traffic in many international cities of the world .these problems are being addressed by building super highways for people to have a smoother ride to their offices and homes .in conclusion , with cars having become ubiqutous as of date , it would be difficult to imagine roads having less traffic .however , i do nt disagree that with well maintained , sophisticated public transport system and stringent state laws , vehicular traffic can be substantially reduced as in the city of singapore keeping in considerations the above said problems of depleting oil reserves , increased air and noise pollution and heavy vehicular trafic in the cities and towns .
