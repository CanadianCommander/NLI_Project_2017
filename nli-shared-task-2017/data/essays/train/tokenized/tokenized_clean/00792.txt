i do not think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for two main reasons .first , if we look at the actual trend , more and more cars are in use .i think that in twenty years a lot of people that can not afford to buy a car today will be able to do so .underdevelopped countries are a case in point .they have been excluded from the car market for a very long time because they were no potential buyers .but now , many countries go from rags to riches and are able to buy cars .china or india , for example , will be major potential buyers in twenty years .tata , an indian car brand , is on the rise with incredible growth rate .the same goes for poor people in developped countries .cars are getting cheaper , and i believe that this trend will continue .today it is possible to have a new family car at $ 5000 .logan renault is a good example .and what about in twenty years ?maybe the starting price of a car will be under $ 1000 .then much more people , such as students , will be able to buy cars .but it is true that , at the same time , runing cars is becoming very expensive .this brings me to my second point .on the face of it , the price of oil is rocketing which makes cars expensive to use .but on closer inspection , cars use less and less oil .i hope than in twenty years few cars will still work on oil .cars will use other forms of energy such as vegetable oils and why not water .technology in this field goes very fast and many changes can occur within twenty years .all in all , i think car companies are still on a thriving market and therefore , there is little chance that in twenty years thre will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
