i do nt think that it will decrease the number of cars in just twenty years .i support my opinion with some reasons i descrive below .first , nowadays , cars are one of the most necessary things in our everyday life .japanese people sometimes express about cars into `` legs  in our conversation .for example , a man says `` we do nt have legs to go to the station.  , then an another man sais `` we can take a bus ..first man said `` lags  , but of course , its not about real legs .ordinary people have their legs , so correctly , he wanted to say about a vehicle , but he exchanged the word into legs .now , you get an idea how cars are important for us like legs .we will keep driving cars even in twenty years later .secondly , everybody thinks cars are convenient .we can move far away , and we do nt need to pay for driving without gas or oil fee .if something new vehicle or machine invented in near future , people might change their way to move , but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than cars .in addition to this , this story is not reality , so we should ignore this now .cars are too familiar vehicle to throw out , so i think it will nothing to change about cars in future .in conclusion , cars are very convenient , and necessary for us .
