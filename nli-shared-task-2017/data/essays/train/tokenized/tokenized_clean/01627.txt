according to my personal experience i can say that it is true that sometimes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i agree with the statement because i think that producers are interested in selling their products even if they know that products they made are not as good as they are described by the advertisement .i think that producers spend a lot of time ( a lot of money too ) trying to create advertisements that makes products much better than they really are .if an advertisement is well done , you will probably buy a product in order to try it , even if this product is not really necessary to you .you simply buy the new product althought you do nt need it at all only because the advertisement impressed you .and when you try the product you bought , or taste it , or use it , you can discover that sometimes it is quite different from how it was presented or described by the advertisement .for instance if you are looking for something to clean away an oil s spot from the floor and you see or read about a new product wich is the best in solving problems like this , you ll probably buy it .but , once at home , you ll probably discover that the product you ve just bought is not as fantastic as the advertisement said .something like the situation i ve just described occured to me .i was searching for a new type af nail and i saw on a magazine an advertisement of a new nail with a great brigthness .for this reason i went to a shop and i boutgh one of this nail .when i tried it i discovered that it was identic to a nail that i have before .
