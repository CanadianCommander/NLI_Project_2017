some people may think that successful people always try new things and take risks .others may think that those people will only focus on what they already know how to do well .i believe that successful people will only do what they are already skilled .it is because they know the reason why they are successful is because no one can replace their specialities .moreover , doing what they are skilled can prevent them from being lose .that a person has a job that no one can replace his or her position is a very important factor for a successful person .my father always told me that i have to find my interesting , and become very skilled in that field .i totally believe those words because a successful person knows his interesting and keep studying it until he knows a lot about his interesting .take my professor for example , she is very good at translation .thus , when some of the faculty members want to translate their books into english , they all ask my professor for help .they wo nt think about others .my professor can earn a lot money by doing translation .therefore , successful people will only do what they already know how to do because they know no one can replace them .moreover , a successful person is successful because he do anything to prevent him from being fail .can a successful person still success when he is failed ?i do nt think so .for example , there was a once well-known company in my country .they were famous because they could produce nicely-look comuters .every body liked to use their computer .however , their boss decided to take a risk to make some lcd monitor five years ago .the money they spent on making new lcd monitor is the money they not used on improving their computer quality .as a result , they were failed on both computers and lcd monitors .did the company success ?thus , successful people will do what they are already skilled .they know no one can replace them and they wo nt take risks to prevent them from being loss .
