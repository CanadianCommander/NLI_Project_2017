glance through a piece of newspapers and you will in all likelikhood see news concerned with the future trends of such careers as accountants , lawyers , doctors , and so on .there has long been a controversy about whether a person coped with broad knowledge will be superior to the one with only specialized knowledge in one academic aspect .actually , this is an issue regarding to the `` width  and `` depth  of knowledge acquired .to me , however , i contend that it is the depth of the knowledge that prevail .this argument can be ascribed to the following rationales .to commence with , acquiring specialized knowledge can have a person comprehensively and deeply understand the academic subject specialized .true , someone may claim that a person should receive general education to be comprehensive for knowledge .however , imagine if a person acquire all breeds of knowledge in different aspects but without further deep understanding of them .do you think if he really understands the core knowledge of every aspects ?in contrast , a person acquiring a specialized knowledge in his education can let him stand out among others .and a specialized person can receive general knowledge through reading books and newspapers .second , from a career perspective , possessing specialized knowledge can serve as an entry barrier for the industry that requires the specific knowledge .a vivid example of this is the accounting industry .to successfully become an accountant or auditor , one must have possessed much expertise pertaining to accouting standards and rules .how can a person who has much knowledge in the sense of width but without the depth compete for the job ?so it is undeniably true that having specialized knowledge can render a person competent enough for his career .last but by no means least , viewed from a macroeconomic sense , having people specializing knowledge in various academic subjects can serve as a divison of labor of an economy .when people in an economy posseess different kinds of expertise , comparative advantages are thus created and the economy can have a pool of talents on different aspects .to further support this point , think of an extreme situation when an unprecedentedly new leathal disease is spread out in a country .if everyone does have a knowledge broadly but witout depth , who can help tackling the problem which require strong knowledge in , for example , bio-chemistry ?in recapitulation , a person possessing specialized knowledge can be benefical for both individuals and the society .i , therefore , stand against the statement in the question .
