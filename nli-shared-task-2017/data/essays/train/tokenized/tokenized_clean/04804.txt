i agree with the statement .in the education of a child it is important to transmit him the knowledge of facts concerning history , science , art and other matters , but it is more important to teach him how to reason independently and to think with his own mind .for a student it is very important to understand ideas and concepts behind facts ; in fact , this gives to the student some schemes that he can re-apply to understand many other facts and he can use to continue learn also alone .notions are relevant , but are ideas and concepts that develop in a young boy the skills required to analyze things and reasoning .in the past to know a lot of facts was very valuable and esteemed , but today , thanks to new communication technologies , information and facts are easily available to everyone and have lost great part of their value .for people today it is not essential to know facts , but it is required to have the capacity and the mind to understand facts and to find out what we really need among the big quantity of information available .internet today is maybe the gratest example of what i say : in the web it is possible for everyone to quickly access to facts that happen in the world , to historical archives , and to a lot of pictures and video .ideas and concepts are also the basis for creativity ; discoveries in scientific areas can happen only because researchers have understood what they have studied , and have gained the capacity and courage to go further simple facts and to design theories and rules also concerning facts that have nt yet happened .aone affascinating example is a. einstein : with his ideas he proposed theories that were verified by facts only many years later .
