cars !cars are one of the most used vehicles today and they lead to a better lifestyle and comfort for a lot of people .on the other hand there are a lot of negative aspects that are involved in the use of cars and people argue about the existence of cars .will there be more or fewer cars in twenty years ?to discuss that topic we have to look at happenings all arround the world .daily newspapers write about pollution and about the effects that occur from cars .people will have to consider our environment even more in the future and they really have to be aware of the risks when polluting the earth .another point often mentioned in headlines is the one that new energy sources , which will be able to run an engine are found and prepared for future use .meanwhile some scientists belive that there will be enough oil to support cars for the next century others think that oil is a very scacre ressource and there wont be enough oil to provide all cars .another point that has to be taken into consideration is that streets not only are overcrouded but also cause the government to spend a lot of money to repair them .surely some of that money will be collected by taxes from street-users such as car drivers but there has to be further consideration .on the other hand there are reasons to make one think that there will be more cars in the future .for example there is the growing population especially in china or asia where a lot of people nowadays drive bysicles but as soon as they can afford cars will buy a car .that means that there are might regions where more cars will be build to satisfy one s wishes considering the hole planet population is not growing that fast anymore and therefore there is no aid of more cars .in conclusion i think that cars will always remain on our streets at least for the next 20 years but there will not be a significant grow of cars .rather people start to think about future generations and environment which will make them able to establish bus systems and train stations to protect the environment .
