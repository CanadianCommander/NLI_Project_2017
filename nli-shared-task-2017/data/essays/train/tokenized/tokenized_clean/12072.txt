some people say that broad knowledge is better , but i believe tha to specialize in one specific subject is better for human lives .first of all , new things are innovated or discovered only by specialized knowledge in one specific subject .the cutting edge technologies or arts can bring about development of human lives .for example , robots which aid handicapped people were not invented without special research in a robot thechnology .in the field of arts , the computer graphic which entertains many people in films or tvs can not invented without computer .this example clearly shows how the specialized knowledge contributes to the society .in addition , a worry that the society with only specialized people is biased and hard to live with is not true .it is because that various kind of people with special knowkedge can complement each others .for example , many manufacture companies employ specialized people and make them research in special fields .sometimes those specialists produce strange things , but the specialists in other divisions can point out problems of the products .even if the odd products go out to a market , they do nt sell .consequently , specialistes realize they are wrong and improve their products , which leads to further innovation .this example clearly shows that specialized knowledge does not always make biased society .thus , people do not worry about that .for the reasons pointed above , i am sure that specialized knowledge leads to better human life and should be respected more than broad knowledge .
