i am disagree with this statement .if you learn with statements it will be more simple to learn and archieve in the mind .you can learn for what you need that for , see what is the important to learn , situations , will not be only ideas , concepts and theory .it will be more fun for students .when a math teacher give the class the students dont know for what they have to learn that thay always say is `` for what i need to learn that i dont going to be a cpa  .but if they teach the kids the facts for what the need to learn that , the importance to need that to be someone in the world .they only learn the concepts take the exams get an a and then what .they go out to difficult world without knowing for what they are going to use the concepts .that is one of the big problems of the us nation , what i m going to study now ? .millions of students graduate every year without knowing what they are going to study .brilliant students working in foodcourts , why ?because they know to much they graduate with 4.00 points but they dont know where to go know .that orientation does nt exist , thats why i think that the best way to a student can learn is by facts , so he can know before he goes out from school in what he is good for .
