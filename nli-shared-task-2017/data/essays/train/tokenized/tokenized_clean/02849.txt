i agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than nowadays .reasons for this opinion is as mentioned below .to begin with , traffic problem is already reached its peak .as a korean dwelling in the city of seoul , i always have problems to find an empty parking lot when i drive out in the city .similar to myself , many people living in seoul does not use their cars if it is not really necessary because of parking problems and traffic jams .moreover , these phenomenons are getting worse .also , since more and more population are concentraing into major cities including seoul , there will be less cars .secondly , the metropolitan cities are setting up the plan to establish more and more natural parks in the city areas that there no-car areas and streets are increasing .it is expected , in seoul area , that there will be so many sections that prohibits the access of vehicles after twenty years , it will not be efficient or comfortable to drive cars in the city areas .for example , one of the plan of the mayor of the city government of seoul , newly elected , is to convert the yongsan u.s. military compound into a natural park .he is even planing one of the bridges to be walk-only bridge to let people feel the natural environment of han river .thus , using cars will be decreased because of its inefficiency .thirdly , development of public transportation is magnificent nowadays .in seoul , there have been influx of cars for last 20-30 years , but nowadays , many citizens use public transportations including buses and expecially subways .there are 12 lines of subways in seoul that you can reach to almost any place in and out of the city .since the cost of petroleum is ever growing , using buses and subways are becoming much faster and cheap .in sum , it is expected that there will be fewere cars in use in twenty years .this assertion is on the bases of the reasons taht serious traffic jams , growing areas of car-prohibition and efficiency of public transportations .
