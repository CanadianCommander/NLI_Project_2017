successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .as far as i am concerned , i m agree with this statement for three main reasons :firstly , i think that a person is successful because he or she takes risks .in fact in the business world if you do something you would obtain a good result to be a successful person .so you can obtain a good result only if you take one or some risks .for example in a company you are an important manager and your work is always perfect .but you want to take a promotion and so you take a risk : you change your type of work and so your results become different .if your leader appreciate your new work you will take a promotion but if your work is nt good you wo nt take a promotion .secondly , risks are beautiful because a static work is not as nice as a very active work with a lot of risks and changes .in fact i think that you will become a successful person only if you do a very active work .for example bill gates is a very successful person but he is successful only because years ago he took a big risk : in fact he created a computer company and he spent a lot of money in this work .so he took a risk and now he is a very successful and rich person .finally i think that the succesfful people are people who manage our world while the other people wait and see .in fact our world is so beautiful because some successful people have created a lot of things for our life .for example some successful people have created cars and airplanes to make our life more confortable .in conclusion my opinion is that try new things and take risks are very important because if you do this you will become a very successful person .otherwise you are a normal , static person .
