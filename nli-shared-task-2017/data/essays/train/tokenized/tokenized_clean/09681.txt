i do agree .in fact i would say that this issue marks one of the most important cultural differences between europe and the united states of america , and that it is one with enormous economic impacts .while in the usa there is a very strong culture of the succes , exemplified by the working people whose valour and will to reach as high as they can leads them to a great economic succes not only for them but for the entire society , in europe nowadays economically succesful people is being regarded more and more each year as demons guilty of the misery in which so many people around the world live .as many modern european intellectual vices this opinion is very likely to be found ( but more as a trend to exhibe than as a reality ) in france .i must say that when i use the term `` economicaly succesful  i do not refer to plainly rich people but to people who has achieved to make money by themselves and by a productive activity .this leaves out speculators and the like .i will now justify my opinion on the french : french youths nowadays would prefer , in a seventy percent majority , to become civil servants rather than to work in the private sector .being a civil servant in france has even more advantages than in the rest of europe about free services such as health care or education for your children .however this way of thinking is leading france to not being able to keep up economically with the rest of europe , and europe to not being able to keep up economically with globalization in general and with the usa in particular .on the other hand once you have acquired deep knowledge about something it seems such a pity not to use it , and the labour market usually demands more specialists than entrepreneurs , and much of the features that make the usa so dynamical in economics also create great inequalities in its social tissue not to be seen in europe , so in this issue as in many other i would suggest to find an equilibrium point instead of clinging to an extreme position .
