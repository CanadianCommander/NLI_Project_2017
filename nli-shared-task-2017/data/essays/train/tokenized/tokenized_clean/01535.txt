in the world , there are so many cars that people can use them for transportation .it is necessary because of illness .when one of family members becomes ill , she needs a car .that s why , ambulance may not come immediately .however , cars may not be used in the future because people do nt want to use them such as telecommuting , air pollution and price .to begin with , telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs .thus , they do nt need to use their cars ; that s why , they work at home .they also do nt go out for this reason .moreover , telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jam .as long as people work these works .there are nt any taffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason .in addion to telecommuting , air pollution is a real big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollutin for many reasons .automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells .people can affect them in a negatively .furthermore , people want to live healty without automobile gases .i think that goverment use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads .besides telecommuting and air pollution , cars are expensine because technology .when we looked at he past , cars are more developed than the past .also , prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car .this is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future .moreover , for instance , i work a job , but my earning is not enough to buy a car .hence , i can not afford to buy the most developed cars .in conclusion , in the future , i think that people do nt want to purchase automobiles as a result of these reasons .therefore , people should prevent these problems .i consider no cars and no problems for future .
