there is an argument concerning whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .some people might say that learning one special subject is more effective way of study .however i agree whit this statement .because people can build their carrer and social skill .i will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea in this essay .first , people are able to develope career through having various subject .in other words , if someone study only in his area .he/she only know about his field .so his/her skills can be narrow and limited .in my experience , when i was a university student .my major was the study of vietnamese .so i could speak and write vietnamese well .but when i graduated from school .it is not necessary .most company needed people who have various skills .so i should study again .at that time i studied broad many subject such as economics , english and so on .finally i could get a good job .therfore having broad knowledge is good for showing people s ability .second , student can improve their relationship with other people thank to taking many subject .what i mean is that when student have various classes .the they can meet different kind of people .so it give a good chance to build their social skill .for example , one of my friends take a lot of course in his college .so have many kind of friends .when he has a problem .they try to help him .and he can be a very sociable person .that is good in his job .consequentry , through having various knowledge , people can make good relationship with other people .in conclusion , i completly agree with the statement that having various knowledge is good way of study .because of the reason that i mentioned above .
