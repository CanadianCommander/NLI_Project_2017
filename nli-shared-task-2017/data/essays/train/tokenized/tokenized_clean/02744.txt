i really agree with this topic .when i see the advertisement , i become to want it or eat it or drink it .i have a experience about it .when i was watching tv , i saw the commercial about `` taco-bell  .i had never eatten it .it seemed really good .then after school , i asked my host mother to take me there because i seriously wanted to eat it .then we went there .and i ordered it .i was very surprised when it came .it was just like my finger sized .when i watched the commercial it was much bigger than real .and it was warm , not hot .i always become to want it when i see the advertisement .so i was glad it was not like machine .because it was not so much expensive .sometimes i really want to get something expensive when i see the advertisement .but i can stop feeling that i want it .i think because i missed the `` taco-bell  s meal .as we can see there are many advertisements in the world .i do nt think it is good to make priducts seem much better than they really are .it is kind of trickster .it is kind of illegal things !!however if i became someone who was selling something , i would have the advertisement .and i would say something which make products seem much better than they really are .so everyone dose it .i think it is like lace , and someone who male gppd advertisement would win that lace .we have to search what it really is form hidding in advertisements .it is hard because every advertisements hides the truth .we have to think about it deeply before we get it .but i always become to want it .i would like to change it .
