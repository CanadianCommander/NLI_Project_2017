in my opnion , this statement is true .it is because most young people spend their time not helping their communities but theirselves .for example , some people have to work for their life , other people have to study for passing the school-entrance-test .you may think , however , many people belong to clube or volunter-activity .of couse , some people take part in some activities , but the number of them is decresing than the number of them in old years .this fact shows us that young people today do not give much time to participate activities .so , it is true that young people today do not give much time to helping their communities than young people did at the old day !
