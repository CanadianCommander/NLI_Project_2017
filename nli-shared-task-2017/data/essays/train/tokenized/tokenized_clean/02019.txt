taking risks and learning new things are important aspects of life which enables one to succeed in lots of areas .succesful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .i surely prefer to learn new things and to take risks .first of all , learning new things allow one to improve himself both physically and personally .for example , he would develop his personality by learning how to talk to the elder people , how to eat in public and how to behave in serious situations .by learning these , the would add up to his personality in order to be a good person .he would also improve physically by learning how to play basketball and how to make defence by using physical strength .while one is playing basketball , he would learn what sacrifice means when he risks himself for his teammates therefore he would have a better personality .secondly , one would get experienced if he learns new things and takes risks .he would be more aware of the world and he would be wiser and cultured .he would know what is going on around and he would be a responsible person .for example , he would risk getting rejected by telling a girl that he loves her and then when he learns the reason of rejection he would try to improve himself and he would have obtained some experiencence by thinking of the time that he spent with this girl .moreover , he would have adventures while taking risks even if it seems dangerous .when one is entering into a mysterious cave , he will not be knowing that there are new animal species in the cave and he would learn about these new species by entering the cave and by seeing them so they would have had an adventure while also learning new things .in conclusion , i strongly believe that risking is a part of life is the key feature to learning new things .everyone must be hungry and willing to add new things to himself !
