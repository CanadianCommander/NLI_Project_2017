with this set of materials i m really disagree !cars will be fewer is a fantastic future !in fact in the last years the number of the cars on a road is moltiplicated !only if an organization like a government or much importatnt like onu or nato will make some mesuerd like a laws for this problem we will see fewer cars turn around !my thesys is supported from the known of human mind !some years ago people every day walk , go by bike or take a bus for go to work , to study or to do other things !today man is able to buy a car and use it for his things , this because the world changed and are changing on !many years ago peolple got up in the morning and think what the best ways for find a food ?later in the years when man got up think :how can i do for live better ?this is one of the means of evolution !so , i m sure , next years peaple will think , for example ,how many cars can i buy for live better ?another example to support my opinion you can find in the last years .family ten years ago has only one car for family , that father usually use .today for each family you can find minimun two cars , one for a wife and one for a husband .now number of cars are increasing and next years you will see better in one family every components of a family has a car !i know some my friends that have two car for each one .the evolution can help us to find a ways for limite a pollution for example or increasy the useful of a car , but modern people want to have everythind to take with the hands . ..the strange things is that this man or woman that does nt want to walk or take a bus or move , in the evening will go in a fitness center for have a physicol activity !for this reason usa that is a rich country people are became fat !in fact fact is one of the problem of modern socety .because machines like a car are doing the all thing that man did before .so i think that that sentence is very funny and fantastic !!!
