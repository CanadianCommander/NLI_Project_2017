i agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather that only doing what they already know how to do well .when you try new things your brain is working harder .if you take new chances that means your are an enthusiastic an positive person .i m trying to study a masters in law in a new york city university , so i m risking not only to deal with another language but also studying a new legal system .let s assume i can work in another job that is not legal such as be a court interpreter and make good money .i can work as a legal interpreter but i m a lawyer in my country , so why not risk and become what i love the most which is to practice law .at the beginning i was afraid because it is a new language for me , a new legal system really different from my country which is common law .but i m a capable person , enthusiatic and energetic .i m trying to learn new things that i will .succes for me means to try new things does nt matter how much they will take you to achieve .generally people just prefered to do what already know because is easier and sometimes puts them is a better position not try harder .it s difficult to try new things but if you can accomplish your goals in your life generally you will be a succesful person .always make your best as a person that is learning every day .
