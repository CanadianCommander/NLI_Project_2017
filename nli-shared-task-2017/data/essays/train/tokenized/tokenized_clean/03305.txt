there is a controversial issue about whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .depend on personal experience , personality type and viewpoints of the globe , we may find that some people may hold the opinion that there are more cars in twenty years than in today , on the other hand , some people may choose there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than in today .the choice , nevertheless , is not easy to make .however , from my point of view , i would like to believe the later one is more reasonable .for there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now , my arguments are listed as follows .a essential reson can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from the cars in big cities pollute the environment around us seriously .according to a recent survey accounced by the a dminister of health of china , the cars gas pollution accounts 38.7 % in the total pollution which harm our environment .this strongly demonstrates that the cars pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be less cars used in our lives .another reason of my inclination is that the numberous cars make the cities become overcrowed and it is very unconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on .for instance , in big city , it usually take one person live in outskirts one or even two hours to arrive the company he/she works in in the center of the city .so this is very convenient a .althrough i agree that there are a couple of advantages of using cars , but the disadvantges are more obvious , such air pollution , traffic jam , expensive fees for feeding cars .taking accounts all the factors and recognizing the facts discussed above , i would like to maintain there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than now .in a word , even though there are many different views towards this topic , as far as i am concerned , i will vote the opinion that there will be fewer cars in the future than in today , not the idea there will be more cars in the future .
