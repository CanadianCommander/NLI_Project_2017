personally , i do prefer to travel by myself .traveling with a group has limitances that i think reduce your experiences in a place you have never been at .everytime a person is leaded by a guide , his preferences or opinions are more likely to be affected by other s opinions and , also are predeterminated by a person that already has a point of view based on his own experiences .when a person travels by his own , the only way to enjoy the travel is to be always aware of the world around , due to it is a new place and your senses are open to any movement .it is exciting because if you do nt take care of the things around , bad experiences will happen easily .from this perspective , there is not doubt that traveling in group is much better .a group gives you a safety sensation , even if you do nt know the people around , a feeling that whatever happens you will have somebody to share with , negative or positive .also , a lot of friends can be made in a group trip , i believe it is another advantage .it is usually a long time spending together with new people that at the end , you share your new experiences with them .in other hand , traveling alone is a great idea to make new friends .although it is true that it s only you in the trip , it does nt mean that it is only you at the places you are visiting at !also , at the end , you will share your experiences with other people and the most important , other s will share experiences quiet different from yours .as far as you are willing to meet new people and know different places , a predeterminated group is not necessary to enjoy a trip .in regards of the tour guide , from my standpoint , learn and search information by myself is the most reachness way to expand your knowledge about a new place .a tour guide will only tell you typical things , memorized information from a book or a little guide .then , if i just want to know general things , i do nt need a guide , i need a book .traveling by your own , you need to get information , maps , places and people .however the difficult but also the most rewarding part is not to have the data , is how to get this data .due to there is nobody that will provide you all the instructions for the next day , schedules and rules , it s necessary to create yours .creativity is the most important ingredient in a succesful trip , you need to define what to see , when to be there and how to enjoy it .besides , traveling in group is much more expensive than traveling by your own , and in fact , it has sense .if you want somebody to be your tour guide and a complete schedule of your next days activities , you have to pay for it .in conclusion , a traveling experience is much more appreciated when it is created by the person , it is a way of live a trip even before you leave home .
