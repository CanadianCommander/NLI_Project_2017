i agree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .a person who is successful is successful because they have worked hard on something that made them successful .and being successful also allows you to do different things instead of focusing on one thing because you have that extra time to think about other things .trying out different things and taking risks kind of goes together .if you are trying out something new , you are taking the risk of trying something you have never done before .everyone in the world wants to be successful , but everyone has their own opinion on what being successful is like .some that it s money , some say it s power , and some say it s having a good life .but the main question is , what qualifies you to be successful ?in order to be successful , you have to work hard .you ca nt just sit around and wait for success to come to you .you have to act in order to be successful .for instance , succeeding in life usually involves education .if you work hard and study really hard in college , or school , there s a higher chance for you to be successful than the others who did nt try hard .so in order to be successful , you have to work hard .when you are being successful , you have the time to try out different things .you have the spare time to try other things , so you keep trying different things .after you try numbers of different things , you want to succeed in more things .it s kind of like an addiction .for instance , a successful mathmatician might want to increase his range of what he can do , so he might raise the hurdle a little and memorise the first 100 digits of pi .after doing that , he might move on to 200 , then 300 , then 400 , and so on .a successful person does nt try different things .a person trying different things become more and more successful .if you are trying out different things , you are also taking a risk as well .you are taking the risk of being afraid , and fighting with yourself .because everyone is scared to do things their first time .think back to the first time you rode a bike .you were scared that you were going to fall , so you had training wheels .but after you got used to that , you tried something new and took the risk of taking the training wheels off .this is the fist step in trying out something new .in order to try out something new , you have to take the risk of improving what you can already do .this gives you more experiences in life making you a stronger and more successful person .as mentioned above , being successful is about working hard , and achieving goals .but in order to do this , you have to try out different things instead of focusing on one thing .and finally , taking a risk and not being afraid of what s to come are inportant factors in order to be successful .again , a successful person does nt try different things .a person trying different things become more and more successful .
