it is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .some people say that youth are pay enough time helping their communities .however , i believet that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities because they have a lot of assignments and most yougers are individual .first , young people have a lot of assignmemt , so they can not spend their time helping theit communities .nowdays we are live in a floods of information .youngers should study lots of information .it result to young peoples to have a huge of assignments .they do not have enough time .for example , when i studied gangnamgu library , one of the most famous libries in korea , i always study with juvenile .they studied their school assignment too hard .thus , youngers do not give enough time to helping their communities .second , most young people are individual .they do not pay attention with their communities .even they do not have affection about their parents .modern society brought an individual circumstance .people do not worry about surroundings except oneself .accoding to the dongilbo , one of the most famous research center in korea , 76 % young people do not know their neighborhood .even they do not care about that .thus , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do not care about their neighborhoods and surroundings .in summary , youngers nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities bacause they have a lot of assignments and they do not pay attention .
