of course , the car is a kind of very important transfer tools .today , we can not go out without one car .however , it has some problems resulted from using cars , like air pollution , traffic jam and so on .so some people said that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .i believe that the car is the essential tool which the number of it can not decrease .first , because cars benefit our lives a lots .for example , you can not image that the ups employees transfers packages on foot .all the recivers of these letters and packages would be very painfull .and also all of the airlines would be explosed by thousands of people , if we want go to see someone near your city , i think the only way you can choose is by bike or by plane .the problems that cars bring i think is the most major reason of some people think it will be fewer in the future .let us see that problems , first it would be the air pollution that is very bad for people s heathy .and maybe the oil resouses destory is another problem .but these questions already be watched by scientists , and they are inventing and discoverying some new `` oil  .depending on today s techonlogies , it s easy to deal .second , the traffic jam is a obvious problem , but some auto designers who i known in some auto company , like benz , bmw , ford , and so on , are developing some new cars that fit the city roads system .also , the more and more city planners realize this problem .
