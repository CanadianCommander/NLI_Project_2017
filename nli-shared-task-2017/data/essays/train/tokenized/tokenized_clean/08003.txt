in twenty years from now the world would have changed greatly as new technology is created everyday .as for cars it is a difficult question to answer as it can be argued both ways .so will cars increase or decrease in number after twenyt years ?over the years more people are coming into this world and so the demand for cars is becoming greater .more money is being made by everyone and poeple are getting richer each day and so i believe for these reasons that cars will increase in number but the energy used to operate cars will be changed as natural resources are decreasing and will soon run out .as for the other side of the argument , yes the number of cars will decrease as natural resources are running out so sooner or later the goverment must put a limit to the amount of cars used .another problem is the amount of enviromental damage that is effecting our world greatly .cars pollute our world a lot and they are the main cause of temperature changes .if the use of cars continues in this amount we will soon start having more sicknesses and that is why cars will soon be decreased in number .to conserve natural resources new sources of energy will start being used soon as a new technology and these new resources will diffenetly be expensive and not all people will be able to afford them and that is why not all people will have a car in twenty years and that is why the number of cars will decrease to a certain extent .in conclusion the reasons for cars to decrease in number are more than the reasons for them to increase and so i believe that yes cars will decrease in number in twenty years .
