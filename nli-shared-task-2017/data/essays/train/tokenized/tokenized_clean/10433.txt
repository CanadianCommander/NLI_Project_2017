some people may think that people should specialize in one specific subject because they can write a good thesis .however , i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons .first of all , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is useful for working .for example , in 2000 , when i was a forth year student in university of tokyo , my major was civil engineering .of course , i took the subjects about the civil engineering , but i also tool the subjects such as economics and politics .now , i work at japan central railway company as a engineer and my project is to plan to build the station building .i need to discuss with many co-workers .i can solve the problems about this project effectively because i learn about wide knowledge about many subjects .as a result , this project goes on very well .this experience shows that having wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects is very useful for working .in addition , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about many academic subjects .for instance , i join on the swimming club now .this team is consist of a lot of members such as professors in keio university , workers at banks and engineers at heavy industrial companies .in this club , we often go to the bar after the practice of the swimming and exchange some information .i can communicate effectively with every members because i have wide knowledge of many academic subjects and i can ask some questions to them .as a result , i can make many friends .as the above example demonstrates , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about a lot of academic subjects .in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
