succes is gotten when someone gets a way to live whitout the need of doing difficult things .there are many diferences between successful people and unsuccessful people .i belive that successful people try new things and take risks because it is the way to learn what could be a good deal an what could be a bad deal .this means that successful people does nt only do what they alredy know , but they try to advance and try new things , which are new ideas or maybe few old ideas together .in the other and , useccessful people try to do just what they already know how to do , becuse they have fear of failing in their attemptt to succed doin new things which may be concidered risked .they belive that doing only what they already know how to do well is the way to succed because they re sure that in this way they would not fail in their attempt although they already know how to do it well .as example , begining a new business is a risk , because it could have two endings : earn big cuantites of money with that busisness , or become broken .this is a risk if you are bigining your succesful life , but one should also keep in mind that whitout risk there is no success .another example could be an athlete .the athlete has nt been a big athlete since he was born .he had to practice , to excercise , to give his or her best to becamo the athlete he or she wanted to be .and if the athlet had never taken the challange of practicing , excercising and giving the bes he or she has he would just be a normal person not know because of his abilities .so successful people take risk , wich are nt always certain , to become the successful person the wanted to be .and this is the way to become succesful , i can say that because , you know , whitout risk there is no succed .
