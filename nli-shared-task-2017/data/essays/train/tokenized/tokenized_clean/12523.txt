some people might think that it will be disappear the number of cars within few years .i do not agree with this idea because the car is good transportion to go somewhere and there is not significant trial as alternative cars .first , i can say that the car is the best vehicle to go somewhere .we usually use the car when we go some place .even though the distance is long or short , driving car is suitable for any distance .for example , when i was in summer vacation , i went to 3 academies for learning english conversation and english writing and computer class .academies were so seperated that i needed to ride something .at that time , my sister recommended me to ride a motor scooter .because it was cheap , i thought that to ride a motor scooter was a good idea .it was not good idea at all because of long distance for a motor scooter .i think that there is any vehicle that can replace the cars because i can drive any distance even though it is ten meters or five thousand meters .secondly , people rarely try to develop the new vehicle .press usually says that we are in the situation of lack of petroleum .in this situation , most car companies try to find the alternative energy instead of gasolin .for example , i visited a car company when i was middle school student as a school picnic .in there , i could learn lots of information about cars and the source of energy .the supervisor of that company told that cars were faced of shortage of energy .in addition this meaned that we woud not make new transportation but find new energy .it took hundreds years to make cars and it is too late to make new vehicle now .that idea made people do not care about making new transportation for moving .i agreed with his idea and i can feel that few exerts to made new vehicles for money .i believe even though several years are passed there are still many cars .cars are the best way to move and people hardly try to make new ca
