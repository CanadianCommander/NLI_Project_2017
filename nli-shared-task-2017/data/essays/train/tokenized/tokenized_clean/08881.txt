the department i am currently studying has the policy to encourge all the students to specialize on finance or marketing .the logic behind is that you can not make smart choices if you have less and broad knowledge in a specific topic .i totally agree with the idea that focusing is better .because i believe that you can not talk or make comment about every topic in the world and to specialize encourges you to learn more and makes you love the topic .firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details .therefore the ability to make comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible .for instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film only can tell one or two sentences .however a person who watched the film and read many things from the magazines about the film can make comments or discuss about the film .thus the people having less about a topic have not the right to discuss about this issue and can not be able to make smart comments .secondly knowing a lot of things about an issue encourge to learn the topic more and makes love the topic .because the beauty hides in the details .when i start to learn about a topic it always seems to me very boring and hard to understand .however after passing this point and coming to the details i find this subject more interesting because i start to understand .thus knowing the details make the subject important for me / to sum up because the policy of my university i am used to focus rather than having broad knowledge .i would like to specialize in one specific subject because of two reasons .the first reason is the ability to make comments and discuss bout the issue .the second reason is that details make me love and encouge me to learn about it .focusing is always better than know less but about many subjects for me .
