i completely agree with the statement .successful people try new things and take risks because they want to invent new things .for example indian president `` abdul kalam  he is a great scientist , he invented nuclear weapon but still he does not give up his researches in his 80 s .success does not totally based on economy .for example `` mother thersa  who came from other country to india to serve the people .she took risk all over her life to serve the people .now she is called as `` mother  by the whole world .i dont think that any one call her unsuccessful .successful people try to get success in almost all of the businesses .they are not satisfied by doing only one business .for example ambani who came from a poor farmer family , he did a small garments business .he was successful in that business , but he was not satisfied with that .he took risk in his life and did couple of businesses .now he became famous world wide as we well known him as `` reliance .if he would not take risk he would become famous in india not in world wide .therefore i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
