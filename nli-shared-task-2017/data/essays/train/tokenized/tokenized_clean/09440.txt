a lot of people want to be successful , and they try to succeed in different ways .some people prefer to take risks and try new things , while others prefer to succeed by doing things that they master .i always succeed because i do things that i do well .i do nt like to feel the uncertainty of doing something new , i do nt like to make mistakes , and i do nt like to waste my money .primarily , when i do something new , i do not know what is going to be the result .i feel better when i have the certainty of the things , and i always succeed .i need to turn unknown things into known things because i will have more probability to do better things in my life .i have been successful all my life because i always try to master the performance of many activities in my daily life .secondarily , doing new things inplies many mistakes because people have to try many times in order to improve their performance .when people make mistakes often , they can lose credibility with other people .if other people are observing me , i try to perform better my activities .finally , trying new things offers the invovenience of spending a lot of money .each effort has a high cost because the possibility of failure is great when i do new things .experiencing with new trhings requires either new material and equipment or more people .all these resources are very expensive .therefore , i prefer to save money and do things that i do well .successful people do things in a different manner .while some of them try to do somethiong new , others do thigs that they do well .i do not like to take risks in my life , so i try to do things well all the time .taking riks is insecure , risky , and expensive .
