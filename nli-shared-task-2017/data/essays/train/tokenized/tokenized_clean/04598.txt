in the contemporary world , a new meaning to the word ` time  is added : ` money` .today s young people , with the conscience of this reality , thinks about the most effective ways to use their time .money as the root of all evil pushes today s young people to research for the ways of self-masturbation but not the communities` .the most important fact that can not be denied is that humanity is in the middle of a technological transition .among this transition , every new gadget attracts their attention .a new mp3 player , a new cpu with four chipsets or a new software that allows using the same desktop ; they are stuck in the dream of what is going to come next .because of this kind of innovations , they begin to think in micro instead of macro and they become isolated from their community .this isolation causes to associalism and ends by becoming self - centered .when they need help for their own problems , they just have to browse on some online forums and get the answer they need .however , this generalization would not be all accurate .there also exist some situations when young people help their communities such as teaching english language and computer utilization to homeless children , organizing visits to old people , cleaning the streets of the hood they live in , preparing theatral sketches and concerts with the goal of a more compaq gathering .all in all , i do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement .this selfish point of view is the weakness of their relationships with the communities and i think that the cause of their organization problems is that they become more individualists .creation of some ` e` - campaigns in the name of cultivism , is a must that has to be done for the future of the communities .
