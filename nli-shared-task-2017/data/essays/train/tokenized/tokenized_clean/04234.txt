what makes a successfull person succesfull ?it is the way of how they handle things different or more inventive compared to what i call the `` normal people  surrounding them .therefore , i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .in the following , i will present to main arguments to support this opinion and in the end conclude with a generell statement .my first argument to support my opinion implies a switching in the logic of the statement : trying new things and taking risks leads more likely to success than sticking to the ordinary way .in work life , for example , people that climb up the career leadder are always those who bring about new ideas .at first , they question the established process , then they think about newer methods in a greater horizon .after that they wage the costs and benefits .even if the new idea outlines obvious risks , for example a high rent for a store in some not so popular area , they take the risk and start the changing process .why ?because `` risk taking  is mostly regarded as short term statement .however , a successfull person , weightens his or hers decision making argument in a long term perspective and therefore , the risks arent as high as as first glance .the store area , for example , will in this case probably develop into a hip shopping area .the second reason why successfull people try new things is simply , because the have more money to spend on new things or risky activities , such as fun sports or gambling .thus , poorer or `` normal people can not afford trying to many things that get along with consum .of course , there might be exceptions from the stated theory , but in generell i thing that there is a logic and even a circular pattern that supports the thesis this essay is abot .
