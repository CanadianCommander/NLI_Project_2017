i agree completely with this statement .i think there are various arguments to support it .to begin , the growing number of cars is becoming a problem nowadays .in some cities , like london , they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of users by asking a fee to drive into the city .having so much cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution , parking problems , accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fluel .speaking of , it s abundance is dropping dangerously , and of course the price is equally expanding .it s becoming a luxury to drive now .maybe there will be a restriction at some point , that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week .this could encourage people to drive with friends or colleagues to a work place for example .thanks to this , fewer cars will be in use every day !i m actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work .this could even bring people closer together .if you watch sciencefiction movies , you quickly realise that in most of them , there are not even cars !the cars have been replaced by some kind of machines flying around .perhaps some scientists are currently trying to come up with new ideas to replace cars in a environmental friendly way .a easier way to reduce the number of cars would also be to expand hugely the different forms of transport like train , bus and subways in a way that cars will become unnecessary .if people realise that it s easier , cheaper and faster to go anywhere by train , bus or subway , cars will become useless .sadly , this is still not the case nowadays .certains areas are to remote to acces them by any other way than by car .it is still easier and safer as well to ride home with the car in the middle of the night .anyway , i m curious how the means of transport will evolve during the next years .
