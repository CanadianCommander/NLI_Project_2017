i think that we will see fewer cars on the road in 20 years from now non .even though cars broght us many conveniences so far , together came many problems with cars .they have been polluting the evironments ; are exhausting natural resources ; and are not safer means of transportation than others .so governments and companies are developing other transportatin methods .people will ahve to choose other means of moving than cars .first , environments have been polluted by cars so badly that we have to take drastic measures to block more pollution before the situation gets worse beyond our capability .the experts say that the main source of air pollution is the consumption of fossil fuels , most of which comes from cars .albeit car manufacturers  efforts to cut down the level of emission , there are limits in diminishing the emission .besides emitted gases , we are appalled at the noise from cars in the metropolitan downtown like mahattan , new york .the only solution to be pursued should be fewer cars on the road .second , cars are called gas guzzlers because they consume so much gasoline .we are dependent on imported petroleum to run our cars .the world is running out of petroleum in the not-so-far future .we are at a critical time where we should curtail the use of cars .there will be fewer cars if the oil prices skyrocket to the unbearable level .recently the prices went over more than 70 u.s. dollars a barrel .third , comparatively speaking , cars are not safer than other transportations , e.g. , buses , subways or trains .we are seeing so many casualties , amputees and disadvantaged from car accidents .big mass transportations as safer movement tool bewteen places will be preferred if we have more convenient mass transportation system .fourth , governments and companies are making various efforts to alternative transportations .for example , some companies are developing monorails , magnetic buyant trains and high-speed electric trains .monorails and the high-speed electric trains are already in operation between seoul and busan , seoul and gwangju in kroea .finally , it will be inevitable to give up on cars and turn to inexpensive , efficient vehicles in the future .every one s wise choice will save the earth from dirty pollutants , free the country from dependency on imported oil , save many lives from tragic accidents and steer korean toward more livable place .
