i think young people definately enjoy life more than old people do or ever did .in the olden days , there was a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the younger generation .however , the more laid-back lifestyle of the 21st century allows youngsters to have more than their share of fun .nevertheless , there are always limits as too much of a good thing is also bad .with all the responsibility on the older generation , the younger generation does not even feel the need to be role models for their siblings .children , with all their innocence find joy in the most mundane places .a tiny chocolate makes a child smile ear to ear whereas an adult striking a million dollar deal is overcome by greed instead of being proud and happy .children can enjoy the little aspects of life which go unnoticed by the older generation .i would like to illustrate an example from my own experiences .when my family visited thailand in june 2004 , we were all very enthusiastic as the entire family would be meeting up after five years .we all had a blast jet sking , parachute sailing etc .it was only later that we realised that our parents did not get this opportunity as they did not have enough money at that time .in our merriment we had forgotten about them and they , not wanting to disappoint us did not say a word .this is a very trifle example but for the first time i realised how much elders do to make our life more enjoyable than theirs .as we grow more mature , our definition of fun keeps changing .initially fun was synonomous to ps 2 s and partying but as we grow older we mellow down .we realise that fun and responsibility are a package deal called life .when you are dependent on someone , its like your insured and you have no cause for worry .when you get past being a teenager and people start depending on you , you are their insurance and therefore have responsibility .this is not necessarily a bad thing as it instills in you a sense of independence and pride .a little fun is always necessary for anyone - young or old to lead a happy , healthy life .
