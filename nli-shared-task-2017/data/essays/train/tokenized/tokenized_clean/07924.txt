the main goal of every university is to form high performance students , and hence the question is to know how making these students performant and effcient in their future jobs ?thanks to a lot of theoritical courses ?or thanks to practical courses based on the observation of the facts and some experiments ?in fact at the beginning , the role of the school has been tougth in order to share theoritical knewledge , and not to prepare students to their future jobs .why ?because some stuffs can not be taught and should be learnt outside from the university , in an other context , which enbable to learn fact .therefore i am convinced that the first role of the shool or university is to provide the theoritical basis , which are necessary to the understanding of the facts , and the problems of the real life .consequently , i believe that it more important that students understand concepts and abstract ideas , because these are the roots of the understanding of the facts .moreover , can the reality of the facts be learnt at school ?for instance , a job can not be taught really at school , because the school does not correspond to the real conditions of a job .the universities can only provide tools , abstract concepts to make the students more efficent in their future jobs .but they can not prepare them to manage the every day life of the job , in terms of time managing , stress or communication problems between different partners .these topics are learned directly in the companies , and the abilities of a person to deal with these every day life problems is based on the experience of these person .a classroom on theses apects would be completely irrelevant .that is why , the universities encourage students to make internships .this shows that school acknowledge that it more important that students understand concepts at school and then confront these abstract ideas to the reality of a job .in other words , i believe that a student should learn theoritical concept at school , because this is the right way to become an efficient worker : understanding ideas and concepts in order to understand one s own world .
