bussiness people try to market their products by advertising a lot .even though the product is not much important in our daily life , marketing people will make an impression that the product is very improtant for us .so , i totally agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i usally watch home shopping network channel .in that channel lots and lots of products are advertised .people watching this channel are impressed about the products and ca nt wait without buying them .for example , i was very much impressed by storage bags which are used to store vegetables in the refridgerator .the advertisement was so impressive showing that vegetables will be fresh for longer periods , if we store in that particular bags and they have shown two groups of vegetables , one group of vegetables stored in ordinary storage bags and one the other group stored in that special storage bags .so i was impressed and i ordered that particular item .in the real , i do nt feel that lot of difference about the bags and i was not satisfied with the product .advertisements are only one type of way to introduce the product in to the market .just by seeing the advertisement we ca nt judge the reliability of the product , unless we experience the advantages and disadvantages of the product by using it .normally most people inculding me are easily carried away by the advertisements .by doing so , we are wasting time and money .so i suggest to spent some extra time to know the pros and cons of a product form friends or relatives who have used that product before and then decide to go for it or not .i finally conclude that we should not buy a product just by seeing an advertisement of that product .we must have the knowledge of that product , its use and how improtant it is and then buy it .
