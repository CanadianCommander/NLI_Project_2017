i agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .successful people always have some rules and regulations and preplans everything , they do in advance and get success by implementing those rules and regulations .they are having very strong determination and will power to get success in their work .let us consider an example of the great freedom fighter who was well known as mahathama gandhi of the country india .he had been successful in implementing the non-violence movement and also bringing awareness among the people about the movement and succeded in gathering the people and bringing in them awareness .he had struggled lot for bringing freedom to the country with the coperation of other leaders .he had all the qualities which had mentioned in the 1paragraph .he was puntual and sincere and hardworker and also the best freedom fighter among all the freedom fighters of india .he had taken a risk in implementing a new movement and succeded in it .in another example , consider a good proffessor .a good proffesor normally make plans evrything he has to teach for students in advance .he will make a proper time table and also how to prepare students for exams and get success in it .he even prepares how to mobilize the students for their future career .during the class sections , he will implement all the palns he had been made before .he will finish the portion in time and prepare students well for exams and also give suggestions to thier career .finally , i conclude that successful man always preplans everything and follow his rules and regulations .in former example , if mahathama gandhi thought that why to take risk then he may not succeed in bringing freedom to the country .in later example also , if a proffessor thinks that why to take risk in giving suggestions to students about their career then he may not be a successful proffessor .so i will say that a successful man always try for new things and take risks rather than doing regular things what he has known .
