this question is not easy to answer and i think that there is no general answer possible .everbody has to judge for himself .from my point of view , i belief that young people do enjoy life more than older people .right from the beginning of our life young people begin to learn .it starts with fundamental things like breathing , watching , tasting , feeling , etc .later on we have to learn how to walk or run .all these steps go on during our whole life .this learning process keeps people busy and therefore satisfight .even if the learning process does not always succeed immediately or is painful , young people are filled with pride when they have accomplished something .this feeling is so good that young people cry it out loud `` life is so beautiful !do you have already heard an older person crying this sentence ?i have not .in the last 50 years of our evolution , life has changed dramaticaly .things became much easier and faster for example doing laundry or using the internet today like the toefl test .younger people do not have big problems changing themselves while their envoirment changes .although young people always claim that they do not have time left because time runs always out and the world never stops turning , i think they like that way .in comparision older people have lots of free time because they do not need to work any more .or they can tell us from the past and their memories and judge in some case better becasue they know the results but all these points i have mentioned are not strong enough for me to convince me that older people enjoy life more .i guess the changing world is the biggest problems for old people that they do have some problems today .my grandmother remembers quite good when the first man on earth stept on the moon .she was sitting in front of her radio and could not really belief what was happening there .today nearly everybody tells you for further informations go on my homepage under www .my grandmother does not know what the internet is and seh does not want it any more .so belief that younge people enjoy life more than older people .
