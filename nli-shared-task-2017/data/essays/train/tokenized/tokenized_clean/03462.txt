as education is one of the most important sources to build a strong workforce , and western countries depend on their people as a resource , the concept how students learn is discussed in ongoing debates .some argue , students should focus on facts and learn the important past events by heart , while others claim to understand ideas and to have the posibility to make transfers of different concepts is of more value .however both is imtoday , we are living in a changing world .that what might be true today , does not have to be true tomorrow .therefore , adaptation and flexility are very important skills .if students were to learn only facts , which could easily looked up in the library or the internet , they do not learn any unique skills .as well these facts might be proven to be wrong , if not tomorrow than the day after .to build all ones knowledge on facts is not very secure , neither provides it the confidence one needs to be successful in this world .anyway , i believe it is important to teach students some basic facts in different subjects like maths or history .a lot of theories are based of these facts and one could only understand them when the facts are known .the theories a students should learn during his educational life found in a great deal on the layed down facts .therefore it would be the wrong approach to leave out the facts completely of a student s curriculum .having build a stong basis with the most important facts , the education should furtheron focus on the concepts .students should learn what history has learnd the human race , what the backgrounds of certein decisions have been , and furthermore how this can be transferred into our present or even into the future .to understand the idea behind the constitution of the us , explains how the americans became to what they are today .understanding and adapting is far more important than knowing the exact date of the signature of the constitution .this could be found within one minute by searching in the internet .to be able to explain consequences and to infere possible results is only possible if one understood the idea behind .to come to a conclusion , the question is not whether education should only be based on facts or on understanding complex ideas , but how to bring both in the best way together to prepare the generation of the future for there daily tasks .to know facts is the basis to draw the interdependences between situations or people .to know when leads to the question why , and this drives our world into tomorrow .
