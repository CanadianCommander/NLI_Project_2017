i agree with the statment that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do .i have some reasons to support my opinion .first , young poeple is more energetic in any kind of activity than older people .second , young poeple has more chances to study many subjects , for example in university or private school .third , young people can make many friends and have many ecperiences in and out of the country .young poeple is more energetic in many activities than old people .in general , old people has a lot of money to spend compared with young poeple especially those still studing in high school or university .although old people might be able to get pension for sending money , they are too old to go out and do some activities in community .or simply , they are too busy to take care the family or house .young poeple is very active in many kind of activity .they join a tennis club , go to language school and do some volunteer work .if young people do nt have money , they normally earn money from part-time job .young poeple has more chances to study many subjects , for example in university or private school .in japan , when you want to study in university , you have age limitation to be university students .it is also said that when you are young , it is more chances to remembrer and study well .young people can make many friends and have many experiences in and out of country .young people has more good accesses to meet many people .you can go to abroad , you can have good experiences .but when you get old , you tend to be stay home and watch tv whole day .from above reasons , i agree with the satement that young poeple enjoy life more than old people do .
