yes , i agree to the statement that is given above .there are many reasons and examples , i would like to cite in support of my opinion .in everyones life , ideas and concepts are very important to learn the subject .concepts help them to understand and know the subject how it is developed .ideas help them to get logical reasoning on the subject .for example , in consideration of my life , firstly `` i will give importance to undersatnd ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts  .the reasons are concepts are key role and important to get the sunject well and good , without concept there is no subject , if we know the concept of the subject we can go any where to its advanced levels .in this way concept play key to the subject .secondly `` ideas also helps in understanding the subject .ingeneral , the subject is basically depends on the ideas .the person is well recognised on the subject based on his thinking ability , logical reasoning , and creativity .ideas and creativity helps the people to reach advanced levels on the subject .not only on the subject , if we concentrate on concepts and ideas on any thing we can reach the acme stage on that specific thing .but in some cases , for example `` to develop or to get advanced level or to add accessories of any product in the market it is compulsory to learn some facts about that previous product  .it is secondary preference only , it is better to know because `` we can attain the best on the product  .the reasons are `` we can know the demand , publicity , value of the product in the market  .so , to reach success in ones lives understanding ideas and concepts are very important .therefore , everyone should concentrate on those topics .however , beyond concepts and ideas it is also important to learn facts as i had given example .insum , i would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reasons and examples .
