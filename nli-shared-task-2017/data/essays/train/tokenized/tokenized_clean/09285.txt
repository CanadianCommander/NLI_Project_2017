in my opinion the statement is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .to confirm my opinion i will give several examples .for example if you think of a product filled in bags like soup and then of a commercial in television .the soup looks colorfull and it seems that many thing are in it .but if you will buy it and cook it on your own at home there are not as much noodles in it as the commercial wants to make people believe .this happens on an special purpose .advertisements are made to sell something to people .people who make advertisements are specially trained to know what people want to have , so they will only show us the things we want to see .in my example this are more noodles in the soup then there actually are .another example is advertisements for underwear on large posters everywhere outside .on these posters you can see beautifull men and women , and the underwear fit them perfectly .the inventers of such advertisements did this perfect thing to make people think that they can look like these people too if they will buy the product .so it is all about what buyers want to see and feel when they look at advertisements .the makers of advertisements mostly pretend to have the best and perfect product and to convince buyers to believe so too , they exagerate in demonstrating good items as perfect items .no one wants to spend his or her money on things that are not worth it , but they also have to believe in advertisements .
