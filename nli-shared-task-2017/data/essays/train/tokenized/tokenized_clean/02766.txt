in my opinion , i think that for students it s more important to learn facts .during each lecture of something , professors are used to give the students too many ideas and concepts which it will never remain in theyr brain .so , the best way to teach something to the student is give one thousand example about fact that can make improvement to the students .on the other hand sometimes is more useful for students just learn the basic of ideas or concepts understood during the lectures or studying in the textbook .infact , student s get in trouble when he has to understand a facts which is full of concepts or ideas that they didn  study before to hear about the fact .moreover the answer at the question could be as different as the brain structure of everyone .although i suggest to everyone to improve theyrself learning facts i think that for somebody it s not the best way to look for .firstly , student who has a good memory should use it to remember the ideas and concept that they have been learn .instead student who has just a vision memory might use this memory remembering all the images presented in a lecture as a fact explaining the issue .moreover , who get easly in confusion reading different concepts , most of the times difficult concepts , couldt undestand what he has to do in some exercise or in any text where s showed the issue .finally , i think that students have to do want they want
