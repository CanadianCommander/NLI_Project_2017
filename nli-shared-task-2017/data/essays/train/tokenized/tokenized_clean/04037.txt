i do completey agree with the statement presented here .a successful person is he/she who takes risks at almost all the times .he is also a person who tries to try different things and venture out in to different areas .to be a successful person once , twice or thrice you can always do what you already know how to do well or do the same things inthe same area without taking any risks , but if you need to be a suucessful person all the times , you need to take risks .all the successful person s like edison , einstein to say few have always thought on different topics and concentrated on areas where little people have ventured out .one of the most successful person s in the human history is thomas alva edison .he has more than 200 patents to his credit .he always thought differently and has taken risks too .if he has not ventured in to different things and taken risks we would not have seen the bulb till date .every electronic device that work s today is courtsey , edison .a person on the other hand who always does the same things and is not interested in taking risks at any time can be a brilliant person and may be a good person , but can not always be a successful person .another example of the most successful person is of albert einstein .he was the person who constantly had to live with risks .he even faced execution in his own country and had to fly away to another one to save his life .this was one of the risks that he has taken in his life .i always beleive in the above saying of `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .if people of this world has not taken any risks and not worked differently then today we would not enjoy the beauty of this life.i.e life with material world .
