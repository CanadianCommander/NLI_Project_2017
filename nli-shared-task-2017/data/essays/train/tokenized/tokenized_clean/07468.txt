the issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one .some people find it to be beneficial , and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging .i , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better .the reasons for my belief are the following :first , traveling with a tour guide is more informative , since the guide has all the information about the place , and should be able to answer any question .he has also visited the place many times , and knows all the interesting places to be seen .i think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country s culture , than if he was to travel by himself .i have travelled with a tour guide once to turkey , and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full , i got to know most of the turkish culture .one of the things i wo nt forget , is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding .it was a very interesting thing to see .second , the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group .in this schedule the group gets to see the most important , famous , and interesting places in the country being visited , probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of , or could not have planned such a schedule .i find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide .another reason , is the financial reason , usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers .third , i believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country , and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone .when visiting a new place , a person does not know the safe places , or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood .these details , which are of great importance , are taken care of by the tour guide .for all of the reasons , i mentioned above i believe that it is a much safer , and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide , if of course traveling to a country for the first time .
