i strongly believe that people who try new things and take risks are more successfull than people who keep doingg what they already know how to do well .by taking risks and doing new things you face newer situations which will help you to push yourself away from your comfort zone which will help you be a better and successfull person .i have personally experienced and have read many situations where taking risks and doing things have helped changed lives and to be successfull .in my first job i wanted to try out something new and apply for a position in sales and marketing , but since i was a very good software porgrammer , everyone said that i would not be suitable for the position and most of my peers discouraged me from taking up the position .infact i was a little doubtful about leaving my comfort zone and entering into untested waters , but i took the position which eventually helped me start my own business .i would not be in this position if i had not taken that risk .in the business world there are stories of many risks but a couple of them which fascinate me are the stories of bill gates and steve jobs .bill gates quit his school to do something new , something he liked the most and something that was not done before , `` personal computers  .he became successful and changed the course of not just his life but the lives of everyone else on the planet .steve jobs who should be given enough credit for his contribution to the developement of pc s made a comback a few years ago with his latest invetion ipods .before apple computers ( which was run by steve jobs ) came up with ipod , there were many mp3 players but they lacked recognition .steve jobs novel idea of attractive product descign coupled with seamless integration with computers created the new `` ipod generation  and completely revived apple computers .hence based on my personal experience and also experiences of many others i very strongly believe that by doing new things you improve yourself which increases your capability to do better things and to take risks and be successfull .
