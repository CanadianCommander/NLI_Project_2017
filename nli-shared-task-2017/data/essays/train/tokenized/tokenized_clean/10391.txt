sometimes they believe that learning facts is important for students .however , i agree with the statement .this is because understanding ideas and concepts is prerequisite to learn facts and because learning facts itself would not have menings .i will explain these 2 reasons .first of all , understanding ideas and concepts is prerequisite to learning facts .student would not be able to understand what the facts mean if they do not understand ideas and concept .for example , suppose students listent to the news of first degree murder case .in this case , students only know `` bad person was arrested by the police  .they have no idea about what the `` arrest  and `` first degree murder  means .it is not useful for educating students .on the contrary , if they have already studied the concept of some legal term they can understand the case better .thus , they may be interested in law and they want to know law more deeply .this is the effect of understanding ideas and concepts .second of all , learning facts itself would not have meanings .facts have meaning only after ideas and concepts are understanded .for instance , suppose that students are taking class .speaking of history , if we just know `` president washington is first president of united states of america  , this is just `` fact  .but for the students who do not have any ideas and concepts about it , is this fact important ?who cares about it ?they should not understand importance of this fact ( this would be easier to understand if students are not american ) .however , if students understand ideas and concepts of `` independence  `` president  or something , that fact can become important one .as a result , studets can study effectively .of course , i do not think learning facts has no meaning .rather , it will be helpful to student who are interested in outer world .all in all , though , i strongly believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important that learning facts because of avobe-mentioned reasons .
