this is a very interssting question .the answer to this questions is not easy .after my first thought i do not agree to this statement .in these days almost everybody has his own car .it is very confortable driving in your own car , you do not depend on others or on public transportation .i prefer driving by car , because i can descide spontanious what i would likt to do and where i would like to go .sometimes it is even cheaper driving by car , than taking public transportation , like bus or train .while going on vacation , you can also descide using the bus , train , plain or even your car .mostly it is cheaper driving by car .these are some examples why driving cars are could be better than using public transportation .we are not allowed to forget : technologie is rising very fast these days .at the moment the automobile industrie ist trying to develop a motor , that does not spend gas .they are looking for different kind of ressources .the plan is to keep cars , but make them work with electric or solar energy for example .so if they spend another 5 years on developping a new motor for cars , i do not think they will be able find different sources for transportations besides cars so fast .reasons for cars getting fewer and fewer in the future could be the rising prices , not only on cars , but also the oil prices .driving your own car is already very expensive .first of all you must have enough money to buy the car .that ist not it .you must also plan the costs that are related with buying a car , like taxes , insurance and gas .the gas price has been raised since several years and will probably still rise the next years .this makes car driving even more expensive .so if people start thinking about their money in a more serious matter , they will think about really buying a car or saving the money .but maybe there will be some inventions in the future that will change all our expectations .maybe we will be able to fly by ourselves in small planes or in some kind of rockets .the imagination is big , the sky is the limit .i could even imagine that nobody will drive cars in 20 years , because we will be flying , not driving anymore .so it really depends on how the development of inventions for the future are .but if everything stays like it is and we keep using our cars as we do now , i do not agree to the statement above .our population is getting bigger and bigger , the streets are getting fuller and fuller and the car industrie is making more profits than ever !there are so many new cars build year for year , that i do not think there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
