lately a lot of people discussed the questioned if young people enjoy life more than older people do .and infact this question is not very simple to answer , because there are a lot of views with different standpoints from people in different periods of life .so you can divide people into a lot of groups concerning their attitude on these question .if you mention sports for example , i am sure that young people enjoy their life more than the older one , because if you are younger you are more agil and have much more energy to do sports like rafting , base jumping , windsurfing ans so on .maybe older people are a little bit unhappy of not being able to do all sports because of their health situation .another contrary aspect is working .younger people for example at the age of 18 have to make their final exam and maybe want to go to the university for becoming a doctor or a manager .then they will have to spend a lot of time being at home learing all day and night to get a job in the future .they have to concentrate all the time and are not allowed to have fun until they have reached their goal .if you are older , for example at the age of 40 you are yet working in a company and maybe you are lucky of not having to learn so much because your are doing the same work the whole weak , the whole month or even the whole year .because of this reason it is possible that younger people can not enjoy their life until they finished school or university and are able to do their work .another reason why older people could be the happier ones enjoying their life more than younger ones is that they have allready made their experiences with school , parents and so on , that they could benefit from these experiences .so from a special moment on you can start enjoying life because of knowing what to do with your time , knowing some important secrets of life and knowing how to keep the balance in life .when you know these important facts i assume that it is much easier to enjoy life .the most convenient way of making the best out of life would be to know all the important facts from the date of birth on , but i think , then life would not be as funny and enjoyable as it is .
