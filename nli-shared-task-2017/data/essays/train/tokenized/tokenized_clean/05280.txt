will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?my opiniont is yes .i believe with the development of breaking technology today that will lead the world to a brand new transportation time and cut down the cars in use .every morning in the rush hour , we can see the traffic jam and serious air pollution around us .people suffer from that and our children live in a worse environment .it makes many goverments of countries set way to result this big problem and want to bring a better life to their citizents .recently , we found that there is fewer and fewer gasline left on the world .this problem pushes human to creat a new style of transportation .goverment starts to establish public transportation and encourage citizents to use that well .everyone has the responsibility to protect our earth .besides , evironment issue has been raising for these few years .people around the world graduately focus on the protection way of our environment .therefore , most people will follow the goverment s order to try their best to use public traffic like subway , skytrain .to sum up , i believe 20 years can bring a lots of changes .the changes include people s manner and technology .people realize the importance of our earth and make action to do something and technology will help people to find a better way to live .therefore , i believe taht the numbers of car will decrease in twenty years .that s also my hope .
