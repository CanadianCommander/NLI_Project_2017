from the topic given , i would like to view it from a different perspective than just agreeing or disagreeing to it .education life starts from class 1 till about class 12 ( this is the ideal situation here in india ) .from classes 1 to 10 students are given an overview of subjects from diverse fields such as science , history , geography , literature , languages , and offcourse humanities .i believe this is a favourable situation for children who are in their growing phase .this is because , since the children are educated about different fields , they have a better understanding of the world they live in .i believe just as knowing newton s laws of motion are essential , in the same way knowing the history of indian freedom struggle is as important .the child broadens his horizon , and becomes a better informed person .knowing diverse fields is also beneficial because we live in a society .we arent isolated people and we need to interact with people and systems from all walks of life .would it be justifiable to have limited knowledge in this situation ?when children live in a society they should have general knowledge of the various aspects of life and society .however taking this stance , i do not refute the question of specializing in one single field .as a child grows up , becomes an adult , he decides the kind of proffesion he wants to take .for example i wanted to become an accountant .so after my junior school , that is after my class 10 , i took up commerce as my speciality subject .this way after my initial years of learning about the world in general , i could concentrate on the subject , i wanted to make a career on .isnt that justified ?let me give a funny example .suppose i just specialized in commerce throughout junior school , extending to senior school and beyond , and finally became a successful accountant .one day when my child grows up and asks me a simple question about the solar system , and the number of planets in it , do you think i would be confident of my answer ?i would be fumbling , and searching the encyclopedia for possible answers .the thought in itself is not very encouraging .so i believe initial knowlegde of diverse fields in junior school , there after specialization in college would serve our requirments better .since the topic mentiones `` academic subjects  i presumed the subjects taught in an academic environment .so such subjects and such a practice of general study or specialization can only happen in a school .therefore in the above stated opinion i concentrated on children to illustrate my argument in a better fashion .
