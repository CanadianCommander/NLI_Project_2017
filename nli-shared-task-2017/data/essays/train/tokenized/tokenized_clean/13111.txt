in my opinion , history is the most important science .the reason is that , it is both explains the ideas that people were thinking of and the facts that had changed life forever .in that case it describes the perception of the concepts during periodes of time , plus their effects on the evenements .in brief i think it is better to look in both sides and then decide the reality of the statement .history classes are usually based on knowledge of the facts .dates , people , locations are important to know .if we memorise these materials correctly we can also have general statements .for instance all the wars were made because of different interests of states .so we assume that same kinds of facts , like wars , are enough for us to understand the reason or the concept of the wars .in additoin to that it is easier to learn the facts than learning the concepts .concepts and ideas have many consequences or they have even not been realised .in short it is more general and easy to understand the facts for the students .on the other hand , facts are not usually enough for us to understand the reality .for exemple big states can make lots of wars and can gain or loose land but these war can not explain clearly the reason why french revolution had realised .the ideas and concepts emerge and develope slowly and not easily .they have backgrounds and a search for a better life .in addition to that they can be capable of avoiding bad things to happen .to give an exemple , people made wars for many centuries but with the help of the philosophes or thinkers they understand the importance of human life .so they do international agreements for not to battle .however , knowing only the facts is not enough the have a conclusion like this .to summurise we can say that it is more important for the students to understand the concepts and ideas then to learn the facts because it is more usefull for every situation .we can guess the facts in advance by knowing the concepts .
