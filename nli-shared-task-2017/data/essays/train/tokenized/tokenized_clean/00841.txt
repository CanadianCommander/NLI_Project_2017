i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .now , to make the statement clearly , i define the age of each people .i set the age of young people around 20 , and the age of older people around 60 .i can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them has different kind of things to enjoy their life .so , i would like to compare some points .the ordinary differences between young people and older people are the phisical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of the experience and so on .now , i compare these things between young people and older people .first , as to the phisical ability , young people has more ability than older people .so , we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such as sports or dancing all night or other thing which needs energy .second , as to money , most older people have more money than they were young .so , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something costs a lot .for example , my parents enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be .they go to the restrant often and eat delicious meat , and they go to concert or see the show .these things are costs too much for the young people to enjoy often .third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people .because young people have not know various things in the society yet , they can experience new things everyday .so they enjoy knowing new things , new people , new ways of thinking .on the other hand , older people can live with their various experiences for their long life .in the 60 years , they experienced various kinds of things which the young people have not expereinced yet .so , they know more enjoyable things than young people .considering these points , i can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .both people enjoys their own life with their own steps .
