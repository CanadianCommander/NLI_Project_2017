given a choice between agreeing or disagreeing the young people do not given enough time to helping their communities .many people maybe agree this topic .however , i was totally disagree on this topic , and i have three points on it .young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do , communities was the person who live there and not only young people should care .firstly , young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like .for a example , young people play with their friends and they also know about where to play and which was the best time or place .they care about their communities , if there is no play give them play .they not only make friends , but also can help communities .secondly , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do .for a instance , everyday we go to school , we might see our communities what happens ?or what interests ?if in communities who need to our help that we can call neighborhood to help them .it s not cost a lot of time for us to help our communities .finially , communities was the person who live there , not only young people should care .for a example , old people , young people and childrens are all living in this communities .if some one need a help , not only young can help this person , old people also can help them with this time .it  s kind of experience question on it .in a word , i was disagree on this the young people do not given enough time to helping their communities , because of young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do and communities was the person who live there , not only young people should care .
