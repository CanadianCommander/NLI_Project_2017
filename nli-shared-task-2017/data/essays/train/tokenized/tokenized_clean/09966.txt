i believe young people nowadays still give time helping their communities .young people these days still have the same attitude towards community services .most of the youth spend their vacation or weekends on vary kinds of services .community service is the main part of it .they volunteer to do so since they know they have got no paid .this shows the agressive attitude young people are taking towards doing such services .there are some reasons can explain why young people nowadays stiil constantly helping their communities .first of all , they believe that everyone still have the passion to make the world better by using their own power .this thought had been in everyone s mind since all of us was borned .everyone wants to help in any kinds of ways .therefore , teenagers join community services not only at schools , but also among their neighbors .needless to say , the youth nowadays still cares about our society .they devoted themselves into many services including helping the communities .in both government s and companies  perspectives , they tend to give teeanger chances to achieve their goal .there are many opportunities outside that offers young people to help , such as local non-profit organizations and non-government organizations aften have a lot of activities that prevent jobs or chances to help communiuties .the school also help giving oppertunities like garbage cleaning around the school neighborhoods .it is obvious that people all want to help especially young people .over all , although everyone try to help , it really depends on every indivisuals whether they take actions or not .i believe that every teeanagers nowadays have motive to help desparatly and also take their action immediately .they indeed put a lot of effort in many kinds of community services nowadays .
