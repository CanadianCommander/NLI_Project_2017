i would like to point out that i disagree with this statement .as a matter of fact you have to learn in school or at the university the basics in each course .it would be unproductive to start at the end of a special topic .as an illustration i would like to mention that i study medicine in hannover .i am in the fifth year of my studies and accomplished about 250 oral and practical tests in a lot of courses .in my opinion i could say that i have a special knowledge in a lot of medical fields .as everybody knows is medicine a fluent topic and there is a lot of research going on .you have to read a lot of abstracts and surely you learn to build your own different view of the world .regarding the statement i tend to talk about my doctor thesis , which i began two weaks ago .above all it describes certain areas of the brain and their functions .i have to read a lot of books about this topic and later on i will prepare any virtual experiments with mouses .actually i can relate on my fundamental knowledge of five years of study .there are some new ideas and also theories concerning my researches so i have to spend a lot of time dealing with those .according to my dissertation i could not imagine doing it without any medical skills .first of all you start with a and then you end with the z. it is not conversely .furtherore , i think that ideas reveal under specific circumstances .only when you consider these circumstances you can probably understand the main point of this idea .as a conclusion i would like to say the better your general knowledge about a topic is , the more you can talk .
