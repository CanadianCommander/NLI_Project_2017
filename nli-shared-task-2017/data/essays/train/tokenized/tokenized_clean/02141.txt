we live in the world that features highly developed technology , fast life style , and widely spread network of internet .i firmly believe this phenomenon are forced to have an influence on our life continueously .in this reason , i predict that there will be fewer cars in the future .first of all , the development of internet will be responsible for declinge in the number of cars .we do not need to move one place to another in order to meet our friends , get some information neccessary for out work , read the paper that shows what happens today .all we have to do is click search bar or surf the internet .it ll probably be led to the reduction in movment using transportation system , especially riding a car for the period of time .on the other hand , we can not miss the possibility to meet new type of transportation method .for a long time , we have depend on the car that is very comfortable and familiar with us .however , riding a car has weaknesses at many espects .as many highways are crowded with many cars , they cause a lot of problems .for examples , it can pollute the air we breathe every day and many unexpected accidents , which , to some extent , make us injured and dangered .because it has many unconveniences for us , advanced technology is going to help us to live happily without worrying about environmental elements or accidents .in short , i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .internet will make us deal with almost every our work at home and the alternative to the cars will apprear .in the hope of new transportation system , we can concentrate on our present work .i
