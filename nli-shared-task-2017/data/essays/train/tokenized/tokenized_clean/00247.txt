i believe that facts can be learned in many different ways and that school has a different object than teaching students facts .a school s duty is to both prepare the student for his entrance in real life , and to open a student s mind through the constant teaching of concepts and ideas everytime more difficult .facts must be examined and fully explored in order to understand what lies beneath them .facts are nothing more then the final chapter of many causes put together .why birds migrate every year , why people cry when they are sad or why the sky is clear or cloudy ?all of these questions could not be answered only by observation .the laws of cause and effect studied during the past centuries explain us the importance to know the basic concepts that rule the world .every phenomenon , every situation or consequence come from a precise cause .if we can know that cause then we are able to control the consequence , weather we want to repete it or avoid it .i believe that the primary objective of universities , or schools in general , is to give to their scholars as many informations as possible .then , it will be the studient who will decide how to use these informations .facts can teach you many things , they can show you all the possibile outcomes for every event , and they can help you to predict the future based on previous episodes .but facts alone , i believe , can not be consider enough for somebody s growth .
