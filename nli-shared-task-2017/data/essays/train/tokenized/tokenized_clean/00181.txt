in the past , the cars had developed from a luxury skill to a usual material .now , there are a lot of cars getting more modern .also , there are many car companys and factories which build more cars .now , there is a statement claiming that in twenty years there will be a fewer cars in use than there are today .but i disagree with that .the car developed in more than a hundred years to an usual thing , from 1886 to now .and it s still developing in this time !many factories build more cars to get more money , because everyone has a cars or more than one .for some people cars are like friends and they them need them for a show-off .when people want to go to another place , they use their comfortable car to get there .so , the factories can not stop building more cars in the next twenty years , because they want more money .because of the polluted enviroment more modern cars are build which need liquid gas what does nt pollute the air .so , this is another reason for the factories who can not stop building new cars , because they have to design new ones , too .i think , to have fewer cars in use on the streets we need more than twenty years , because in this time people still need their cars either for a show-off or for comfortable moving .also , it took more than a hundred years to develope and when it will go back , it can not go faster , in my opinion .if the statement claims that in sixty or seventy years fewer cars will be in use than today , not in twenty years , then i would agree to it .
