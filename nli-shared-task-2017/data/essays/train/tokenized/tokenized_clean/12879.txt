this is true that most products look better in advertisements than they really are .in this age of agressive marketing and bullish economy , it takes a monumental effort to successfully launch a product , and then capture a niche for the product in the face of competition from other similar products .the problem which most of the manufacturers of different products face is that the market for their product is overcrowded with similar products .so , in order to make a consumer base for their product , the manufacturing companies try to make agressive advertising strategies to make their product look unique and different from other similar products .they try to rope in celebrities like film stars or sports personalities to work as brand ambassadors and spend a huge amount on making advertisement films .also computer graphics , animation and stunt directors are used to make advertisement films depending on the product and its target consumer clientele .few examples which we can see are the cola giants , coke and pepsi .although the product is nearly the same , they spend a lot of money in making advertisements to look superior and different from each other .similarly we can observe advertisements of cars which are literally flying in the air .all this is a part of a unique marketing strategy , to catch the consumer s attention and creating a separate niche for the brand .we should also acknowledge the fact that if the companies do not make the product look better in advertisements , nobody will buy the product .they will not be able to compete with other similar brands and the product will fizzle out or die .so this situation of aggressive marketing and making super ads is as much important as that of the making of the product itself .any good product can not survive without look extra - good advertisements .
