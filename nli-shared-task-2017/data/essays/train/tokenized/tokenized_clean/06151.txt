i strongly agree to the statement that for students ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .the following essay will illustrate this and explain why it is so .ideas come from the creativity with in aperson .a person who has the capability to develop an idea of its own can do anything .he/she can produce many facts from the ideas .ideas acts as the source of many inovations .thus a person with great idea will never be dependent on facts but will always create things on his/her own .concepts also play very important role in the process of learning .to work in any field one has to learn the basics of that field .it is a very simple statement but it stands quite good .in any institution a student should invest most of his/her time in learning the basics and the concepts of a particular field .a person with a strong base of knowledge can bring in astonishing chages in his/her field of study .in our histtory if we have seen that great inventions , either by newton or an unknown scientist , always had a stong backup of in-depth knowledge of the field .if we see the paintings of leonardo do vinci , those are based on the ideas and imaginations which he had and on which he had given remarkable belongings to the world .although , a small connsideration goes sometime to facts as it helps in strenthening ones ideas which has been developed by using the concepts of the field .but ultimately its your own originality which can bring flying colours .in the end i would conclude that ideas and concepts are more important than the learning the fact .so students should concentrate more on getting the concepts and enhancing thier ideas rather than memorizing the facts .
