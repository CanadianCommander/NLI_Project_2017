some people who support most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are but others argue with it .but i have to say that , if i were faced with the direction , i would probably follow most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .first reason refers to profit .only you show your product is very nice , the people will by it .but problem is their product not really so nice .so they use advertisements to expend their merits of products .secondly , no consequence and law to control their behavir .in the following disscusion , i would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint .no issue is more important than now the one that refers to profit .history witnesses and presents many examples .such as some products of company lead the people dieth or disable ; or some hair condition include the toxins ; or some toy hurt the children .but alll this product in the advertisements is the best product compare the sample kind of products in the wold .the people do not know the truth , and buy it .this way can make a huge number of profit for the companies , so they like to do that .do you think these examples are very persuasive ?another reason is head and chief that i have chosen to put here .it is no better illustration can demonstrate the view .for instance , the people know some advertsements is not true .but they also are not so much fake , too .so the people can not use the law or some rule to control their actions .this case is exist in the most of advertisements .if you can see that , you can understant it more deeply .so the most striking conclusion is obovious .to sum up , givern the reasons discussed above , we can arrive the conclusion that most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are .no only did i prefer to agree with this point , but also i were a witness , too .
