in general it is always difficult to decide definitely for one possibility .because both of them contain some advantages but also some disadvantages , it would be the best to decide for a mixture .whereas a broad knowledge of many subjects refers to the ideal of humanism which has been supported for a long time and partially is still being supported , specialization is a phenomena of modern time .we are living in a time of change .scientific and technical progress have coined the last century more than any time before .with the term `` globalization  i only want to mention one of the new challenges we have to master .as a reaction on these changes the idea of specialization has developped .today , there is much more discovered than in former times so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profession or academical direction .as a result specialization is definitely necessary .nevertheless i regard a certain broad knowledge to be absolutely necessary for everyone .our world is so complex and also complicated that people have to know the essential things about almost all subjects to give an reliable feedback for example to politicians leading a nation .if people are not as well educated there will be the risk of creating a society leaded by a few people not thinking about entire people s problems .so i would prefer a mixture of generalized and specialized knowledge .all people should learn the most important elements out of all academic subjects .in school there is the possibility to do so .later they might decide to be teached in one subject and in subjects related to this chosen one .after that , people may really specialize in their subject .by this way it would take a longer time until people start working but it surely would be an advantage for society .
