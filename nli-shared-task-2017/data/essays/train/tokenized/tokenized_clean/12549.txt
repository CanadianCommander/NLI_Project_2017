in a lifetime , be successful is very hard and people usually try to be only good at something and not really successful .what is the difference between successful people and the rest of the world ?this question has to be answered to understand why successful people are so special .if someone said that the key of success is trying new things , i would strongly agree with this statement , because of many reasons .one of the reasons for what i agree with this idea is the way you become successful .successful people are special people , which means they have done something special , something nobody has done before them .the only way to make something special is trying new things , which is already a risk to take .for example , a young and beautiful girl wants to be a famous model .for what i know , the first step is being noticeable by a photographer , in meaning to be chosen between a large group of beautiful women .it could be very difficult to do if this young woman does nt try some new attitude , posture , even when she is nt sure about her move .another reason is that successful people are often venturous .they like venture and that why they can go further .they go over their own limits .once they know how to do something , they always want to learn something else over and over again .according to the `` people  magazines , most of stars were poor in their childhood .they came from destroyed families , divorced families and all kind of big issues .however , they had the dream of becoming successful , so they decide do to something uncommon .they decided to leave all the things they already knew , to do something they had nt done before .in conclusion , i think that the risk is the key of success for all successful people .
