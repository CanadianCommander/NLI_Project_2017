taking risks and trying new things are important factors in order to be successful .however , it is equally important to be sensible at the same time in order to achieve something .one the one hand , only people who are willing to try something new and to take risks can stand out and do better than their competitors .it is neccessary for people who want to have success to believe in their ideas and to be self-confident .a person that never dares something will most probably not be very successful .today , innovation is very important but always connected to a certain risk as well .e.g. launching a new product can fail completely , costing a lot of money and it might even lead to a company s bankrupcy .however , if it is successful , the profit of the innovation is usually higher than the profit of products that have been established on the market for a long time .only companies that come up with innovations regularly are competitive and able to maintain thier market share .one the other hand , people who do not know when to stop often risk a lot .if the risk is to high , it is better not to take it .to my mind , it is sometimes better to stand still than to risk losing everything .if something is not very likely to be successful , it is a very important characteristic of a person in a high position to decide against it .furthermore , it is not always neccessary to do new things if the `` old ones  work well .in conclusion , i agree that people trying new things and daring things are often more successful because one can only stand out in today s society by differentiating from the others .this is very important since success is defined by doing better than the average .nevertheless , i believe that it is very important to know , when something is too risky .only people who balances these to factors well will be really successful .
