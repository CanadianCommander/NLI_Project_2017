before starting this argument , i would like to define the term `` successful  as a achievement of what he/she wants to do ..based on the definition determined above , i would agree with the statement due to the two reasons .first , people who try new things basically know what he/she really wants to do and have a strong will to achieve it .generally , for most people , finding what he/she wants to do is very difficult and people who are doing what they already know how to do well tend to have a hard time with this process or stop thinking about it .for example , i have been working as an auditor for more than 5 years and i know what i am doing well .although , the salary increases and i work more easily because of the experiences recently , i doubt if i am doing what i really want to do and to achieve .the people who are trying new things have already gotton over this question to themselves and is in at next stage .second , people how are doing new things are taking risks at the same time .for example , as i mentioned in prior paragraph , i have been an auditor for 5 years and am working as a manger now .if i decided to leave my firm and to start new career in different company , i might have to start my career as a staff again .taking this kind or riks is very difficult for most people .i respect their bravein conclusion , based on the reasons mentioned above , i strongly agree with the statement .
