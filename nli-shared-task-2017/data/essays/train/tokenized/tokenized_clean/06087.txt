advertisement has been increasing a lot during the last 30 years .doest it work or is it just an illusion ?knowing how much money companies are willing to put in advertisement i have to say it must work .now there is some more reasonable ways of responding to the question .we coud talk about packaging fo instance .between to products that offer the same thing , that are at the same price , i would rather choose the best looking one .for me the product aspect reflects its real quality .in this case the true problem is comparison .i do nt think you make a product seem better than it really is , the point is making the product seem better as the other products !i think this is really working .there is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even gets to buy it : advertising in magazines , television . ..in my mind this may be more efficient because the buyer wo nt necessarily compare the product to the other ones .he will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he has been told it is the best .in this case it is true that advertisement is used to make the product seem better than it really is .now is it really working ?it depends on the price of the product .if you buy only once something really expensive you will really look into advertisement because you ca nt predict the quality of the product with previous ones .now if it s a cheap product that you buy every week , i think advertising has no influence except the first time .in fact buying the same product lots of time ables you to compare the real quality of the product .
