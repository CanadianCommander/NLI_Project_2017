i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because group tour imposes a lot limitation that one may not like .first , if i travel on my own , i can set my travel duration according to my schedule and convenience .when i travel with a group , i can only spend a certain amount of time in certain locations .if i travel on alone , i can choose to stay longer at some of my favorite spots .also , i can enjoy my own daily schedule instead of complying with a group tour schedule .in most group tours , you will have to get up early and stay up late so that you can get to as many places as possible .second , i will do more research to learn about the place which i will visit .this will help me to learn the geographic location , climate , history , and culture of this place .when i just listen to the tour guide , i tend to forget most of the information but if i do research on my own , i will retain and remember them in the future .the place that i visit will be more memorable .thirdly , economically , i will be able to find economic transportation options , accommodations and even in dinning choices .nowadays , many can use airlines rewards to fly free or use hotel accumulated points to stay free or stay for a discount .this will surely help to save a large sum of money .also , if i travel alone , i have the freedom to choose the hotel settings and locations that suit my needs .in terms of dinning , i can enjoy eating at my time and at places that i prefer .food choices is a personal one .i can surely be more adventurous if i can have my own choice .all in all , i think that traveling on my own will give me more freedom to explore in many aspects than when i travel with a group .afterall when i travel , i want to be in a relaxing mode and be of myself instead of being in a crowd most of the day .
