i agree with the statement : i believe that in some years there will be fewer cars in use than today .i think that there are a lot of reasons to support this statement .i accept that cars are really necesary and important .it is difficult to imagine a week without car : some people need it to work with it , other need it to go to work , shopping , travelling , etc .furthermore , some cars are important tools for different public agents , like police , firemen , abulance drivers , bus drivers , etc .cars give to the society a lot of important services , including enjoying free time or working every day .but , on the other hand , cars have a very important defect that makes me think that in the future there will be fewer cars .they deppend on an expensive and harmful material : petroleum .the reserves of this fluid are fewer every year .furthermore , every day is harder and more expensive to acces to the rest of the reserves , and more money is needed in orther to obtain it .therefore , i believe that this fact will make gasoline and diesel more expensive every day , and this will be the first reason for a reduction of the actual quantity of cars running on the streets .the expensiver the petroleum is , the lower quantity of people who can acces to a car and it cost of operation .moreover , there is another good reason for this statement : the pollution .burning of gasoline produces a lot of toxic and potentially dangerous substances .if you take a look to the sky in a big city , you will find a brown cloud of pollution .we breath this every day .i believe that people will have more health problems in the future because of this toxic substances .the goverments have began to try to control this emissions , and one of the steps is to reduce the amount of cars on the streets .another reason that i mantain is that people is concerned about the importance of doing research in this field .i believe in technology .and furthermore , there are another different ways to go form one side to another .for instance , bicicle or little motorbikes are more efficient and cheap .to summarize , i agree with the statement .i believe that the actual situation is becoming quite difficult , with huge traffic jams and health problems .and i think that the first step to solve this situation is to reduce the amount of cars on the streets .
