to some extent there is need for broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but finally one shold master only one specific subject to do great in their carrers .a person having broder knowledge will serve better for sometimes because the things he learned from one subject can be carried over to other .he can easily relate things since he already been this .but if someone who really serious about there carrers , will choose to master a specific subject than going through all the subjects .in this way he will develop his interest and there by he can carry on this , he can do reaserch on wht he has selected , there by he can give new dimensions to theold traditnal way .it will also help him , in his carrer where he can earn more than others do because he has more knowledge about that subject and because he can do things in more efficient way .consentrating one one subject also reduces the confusion and he can see what he want in more precised way .lets consider a a academic student of higher school , he has more subjects to learn then student who is doing masters .but he has that knowledge in limited spetrum .where as student of graduation or pg .will learn or concentrate on one particular subject , and he gets thorugh knowledge of waht is happened , what is happeining and what wiil be ?student on completion wil get highly paid jobs , in his field rather one does nt have more specific knowledge .students should concentare on specific sbject which will lead to more practicallity of applying things .mastering specific subject will lead to more application of what is been learned all these years .it will also develop students attitude towards that subject will inturn gets huge benefits .so , in my opinion student should have basic knowledge all the subjects but he should have more knowledge on specific subject which will serve him better and his society .
