i agree this idea .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the students should find a new ideas or new concepts for the our future .if they learn only facts it is bad because they will be afraid from the facts than they can not to find new ideas or they can not learn the concepts .for example when my father start to fruit business he tell me about the business and some information about the money i said this is very big business and we can earn lot of money but when he started to tell me the facts i afraid of that business and i promise myself if started to work i will not do fruit and banana business .now i am 18 years old and i dont do that job and i can not find ideas and i didnt learn any concepts about this job i am very upset now and than i promised myself again and i will never learn the facts before i started the new job .i want to mantion about that now my father the best in the banana business because he always learn new ideas and new concepts .the students should learn and understand ideas and concepts .when we started to new projects or new jobs we have find and learn new ideas and consepts than i think we will see the facts .the life is hard and every time you have to learn something and you have to learn ideas and concepts .
