as we can read on a lot of magazines , mainly on the ones dedicated to environmental problems , the number of cars in use in the world has increased a lot during the second half last century .this is mainly due to the economic development , which characterised a lot of part of the world , and to the high value of the population .in the meantime we have to consider that the environment is suffering from thyis situation and that the stock of energy is continously diminishing .i agree with the statement that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than are today only in part .the importance of the environment ( for exaample , in some cities is not possible to use a car one day per week . ..thi in order to reduce air pollution ) and the situation of the necessary resources to produce fuels for the cars bring to me to think that in the future there will be a reduction of the number of cars but i m not able to say when this reduction will happen .as example of thethe restiction i work for an oil company and i heard a lot of time discussions about this topic .the fuel demand has incresed a lot and the production too but the possibilities to find new giaciments in order to extract petroleum are not so hight .the first reason is that several places can not be the scenario of petroleum operation due to law restriction . ..obviously in order to protect the envinroment . ..than the high level of tecnology requested ha to be considered .an other aspect that could influence the use of carshas to be anayized : the public services .our cities are giving us more services day by day and people is becoming to use all the these services such as bus and undergrond .this fact too can be considered an action against the use of cars in favor of the environment .it would be interesting to know the reaction of the oil company and the car producers . ..i hope that they will find an other type of engine . ..frendlier to the environmet ,
