i strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks .there are so many things that make people successful , but taking risks and trying new things are the most important part of being successful in my own opinion .the main reason is that there are plenty of people who are very successful by taking risks in their lifes .in addition , the life has become pretty flexible .therefore this flexibilty makes people think differently .recently i have read an article regarding the life of ronald thrump who is very good at realestate business as everybody knows .this article hs affected me a lot , in other words this article has left great impressure on my life .according to ronald thrump , if someone wants be successful , he or she should take risks .also he believes that unless some risks are taken in this life , we can not be really successful as we want to be .there are so many succuessful people also who have become very successful by taking risks , trying new things , working on different fields which made them become very successful .therefore i strongly believe that taking some risks will bring succeed .day by day the world is becoming smaller .in other words , the world has become such a small town as some expert people say .this situation makes this life more flexible as well .as a direct result of this flexibty , people work on very different and new areas .some people who take advantages of these new areas , who benefits properly from these areas become very successful .this is why , people who want be successful should observe new areas and invest on these areas as well .twenty years ago s opportunities were much more different than today .we should consider new areas , new things , if we reallly want to be successfulin conclusion , as the time passes , we should think according to needs of time .the life is really pretty short and in this short life some who take risks properly are successful .at least , i find them very successful .
