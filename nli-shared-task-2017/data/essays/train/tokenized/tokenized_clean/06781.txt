i partially share the idea of those are thinking that young people today do not give enought time to help their communities .first of all i would highlight that we shoud split the world in several areas as well as in differents categories of families .in my opinion in some areas of the world like china or countries underdevelopped young people are helping their communities due to the fact that they are part of a large community with the same problems and with the same historical links .in that case the community can be defined every think is around the people and does not need a further of explanation .at the contrary in countries more developped people are living in their little ireland .it is very hard to dentify the community .if community means family i am assisting to a reduction of the relationship between parents and children due to the fact that the youngs , in many cases are alone during the day and they have not any guide reference for their life .if community means religion i would like to say that most of the young people have different interests than the religion today because they preefre to spend their spare time in a different way .if the community is the sport team in that case
