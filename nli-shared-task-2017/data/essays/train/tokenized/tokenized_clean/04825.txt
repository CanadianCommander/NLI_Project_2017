it frequently happens to me that i buy a product i have seen on an advertisement .but in the end , it does not meet my expectations .i completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i believe this way because there exist several reasons explaining why products are not as good as their advertisements .by looking at the profit the advertising company makes , the competition between numerous companies as well as the way the product is presented it seems understandable for me that products are not as good as one thinks .firstly , the product on the advertisement shall appeal to the customer .the company providing the product pursues the goal to make profit .it can only reach a high amount of money if sufficient people purchase the product .therefore , the company has to make the product seem as best as possible .secondly , one also has to take into consideration that the company always competes with other companies , especially if the product is not a unique one .if the product should be sold successfully , the company has to present it in a convincing way .although the product is not as good as other products , it nevertheless should not show its weaknesses but its strenghts .the purpose of advertising is to persuade the customer that this is the only right and best product .therefore , the company usually has to make the product better than it actually is .additionally , the company does not pay any attention to the customer s expectations .it only pretends to want to meet the them , but it is not necessarily significant for the company .thirdly , the company wants to appeal to a wide range of people in order to influence their decision to buy the company s product positively .as a result , the company is forced to present its product in a general way .it can not reveal specific features because the company does not know if this appeals to each customer .in consequence , the company presents its product better as it really is in order to make money with it .in conclusion , all these aspects prove why products are not as good as the advertisements pretend to be .the main purpose for advertisement is to make profit out of the product .therefore , the product has to seem wonderful , although it is not .
