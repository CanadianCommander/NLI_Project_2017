i completely agree with the statement which says that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well  .those people , who are well known , they often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attention .we can talk about politicians as an example .like bill clinton , former president of the united states of america , or nelson mandela , ex-president of south-africa , who are helping the poor contries in africa and asia , a lot of this category of people work in organizations which have the same purpose .another example is the entertainment artists .many singers after beeing very successful and popular as singers try to move to hollywood where they have the opportunity to start acting .and they even take a lot of risks like investing in a lot of businesses all over the world .the benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract people ; and even their investement does not succed as they want , they always able o try others things because they have the money they need .in the united states a lot of artists , singers and sport-players have their own company or team .consequently , months after months , years after years , they become more and more successful and popular and try news things .consequently , they seem like handling the world in the pame of their hands .in conclusion , people who are successful definitely try new things and risk ; they rarely just do what they already know how to do well and most of the time , tey do it to get more money than what they own .as a result , that create in my view the problem poverty because the riches are becoming more rich , exploiting the second part of the population which is the class of the poors .
