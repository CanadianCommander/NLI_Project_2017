when we have an intention to go travelling , we will very often look for travel agencies where the staff there can prvide us with the necessary information .another advantage is that if the travel agencies will provide us with a tour guide during our journeys .the tour guides are able to tell us the history of the place and the informtion about the scenic spots .however , i believe that the best way to travel is not travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but travelling individually .there are several advantages .firstly , we will seek for information about different places ourselves .through the researh work , we have a better knowledge about the places and this will enrich our knowledge .after that , we can make rational decisions based on our own will .on the other hand , if we consult travel agencies , we will be greatly influenced by their opinions and this will hinder our decision-making .since the travel agencies are profit-making organizations and their common objective is profit maximization , they may not really provide good advice for us .secondly , we can choose the destination according to our own will .for instance , if we enjoy watching natural sceneries , we will look for a place where there are abundance of beautiful and fatastic sceneries .however , if we are led by a tour guide , we can not go to everywhere we want because we have to follow the planned schedules which are designed for all the customers and are not particularly designed for us .travelling individually can enable us to schedule our own time during the trips .thirdly , since we have made research before the trips , we can go to the places we want and to explore the places .we will get great satisfaction if we find something interesting there becaue it is discovered by ourselves .thus , this will create eternal memories in our minds .if we are led by tour guides , we may be bound to stay at an uniteresting place for a long time .consequetly , we will lose the real meaning of travelling , that is , relaxation and entertainment .
