i agree with that statement .i really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .understand ideas and concepts is the key to learn everything .i do not think it is possible to learn in a concrete manner data things if we do not have previously clearly understand the real concept or idea of what you are talking about .even if certain facts have to be known , i consider facts as secondary in the process of learning .i will demonstrate my thought in several points ;first it is very important to clearly distinguish the concept from the fact , for exemple the economy is a concept , although the precise amount of the american economy is considered as a fact .as that exemple indicates , we can not clearly understant data things if we do not learnt previously what is the concept .the concept gives the general idea of what we are talking about .the idea or concept gives to the students the elements to understand and analyse by themselves data things .moreover , the understanding of a concept has to be considered as an entire intellectual activity since it requires all our attention , our curiosity , and our capacity to absorb and understand informations .for these reasons , i think that data things must be used to represent and illustrate the concept and not the opposite .the facts must be used to make the understanding of an idea easie , and it is too bad that the scholar system does not often give enough importance to the understanding of concept .finally , i believe en concepts since i think that students always keep in memory when they have understood it .
