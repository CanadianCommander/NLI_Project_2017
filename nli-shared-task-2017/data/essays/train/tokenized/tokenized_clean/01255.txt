there has been a continuous change in the world for several years .i think that the ongoning chage will continue for the following centuries .the changes will have particular effect on daily subjects like transportation , work life , education system and so on .in the light of this idea , i definitely think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .actually there are three main reasons that will cause this decrease .first of all , the oil reserves on the earth has been decreasing .the decrease in the amount effects the oil prices .even in the last 3 years the oil prices increased dramatically .i think that , this increase will continue according to the decrease in oil reserves on the earth .as the price of oil increases , the number of people who can afford a car will decrease and the total number of cars will diminish .secondly , i think that cars are not a good way of transportation and in twenty years , other means of trasportation will be invented .the cars are not feaxible to be used in both over the sea and in the air .as the requirements of the humankind increases , they will search for more flexible means of transportation .for instance , flying vehicles can be invented in twenty years and that can be very feasible to used .therefore the car requirement will decrease and there will be less vehicles called ` cars  .lastly , by the spread of internet and its tools , the requirement for transportation may decrease and as a result the number of cars can diminish .since internet is widely used both in our transactions and eduation , in twenty years , students attending their lectures from home may increase .actually , this system has already been started to be used in several countries and appreciated by the users .furthermore there is a new consept called `` telecommuting  which means doing your job at home by means of phone , internet and fax .this system is very suitable for several jobs today .to conclude , i think that the use of cars will decrease in twenty years .according to the decrease in the oil reserves , increase in the requirements of flexibility and spread of internet all over the world will have particular effect on the number of the cars in the traffic .
