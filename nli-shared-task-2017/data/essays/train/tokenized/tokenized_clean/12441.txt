i think it is important for students both , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts .if a student understands ideas and concepts he will analyze different positions about a topic and also can have discutions in class .there are some ideas aond concepts that werw introduced in a particular fact .so , concepts can help students to understand some facts , because a new concept that explains something can bring a change that became a fact .for example a discover is a fact in which a person introduce a new concept .facts for students are very important in all the fiels of knowledge because it is the way that they can undertand the changes for instance in literature , or history .there are some facts that shows a change for the people that are includend in this change .when cristobal colombus discovered america was a fact that cause a change not only for all the people living in america in the fifth century , but also caused ne challenges and goals for people that came from europe .so a fact is important to understand all the period that follows it .concepts and ideas are basic for learning because they give students meanings in all the subjects of study .in literature there are concepts that students may understand the different literature movements or concepts that some writers introduced in literature that now are important .in biology is important the concepts of living species : or in geology , evolution of earth is a very fundamental concept , all the geological changes that have occurred are also facts that scientists concludend in some research projects .in conclution , not only facts , but also concepts and ideas are very important for the learning process of a student because in some cases they are relationed and give the student details to understnad and learn in a beter way .
