successful people try new thingsi agree that suceesfull people try new things and take risks .how do you think all the people you see in newspapers , magazines , television , because of their achievements get there ?there are three main reasons why : first because they try new things , second because they never give up , and third they have a positive attitude .the first one is `` they try new things  .as the statement says people with success try new things .if you are a person that does nt try to take risks because maybe it wo nt work , you re never gonna triumph .you will be a person that will end up working for someone , probably in a company that has a lot of success , when you can be your own boss by trying new things .instead of going out and find new possibilities to improve your life .the second one is `` they never give up  .of course everybody knows that for you to get to a goal you need to be constant .you will fall , and not one time but several times , but thanks to those mistakes you will learn and you ll make sure not to do them again .but you need to stand up again and keep going , because if you do nt , you will never get to your final goal .it s like when you start walking you fall a lot of times , but at the end you end up learning , and walking .finally , is the `` they have a positive attitude  .this is a very important one .through out you life you will have to talk with other people .to make bussiness with them , to make friends , to ask someone to be your girlfriend or boyfriend , to get something you want , etc . ..communication is a very escencial thing in life , and each time you communicate people notice your attitude .so if you re a negative person that s always stressed out or with an angry face , peaople will not want to hear , make bussiness , or be with you .but if instead you are positive , and you re nice and treat people well , you will succeed in life .and even though you do nt believe everything is based in the way you think .in conclusion i would like to say that if we all try new things in life we will be succesful persons .do nt go around life being afraid of trying new things , good things .because you will be privatizing yourself of many things and that can help you be a better person .and as i said , everything is based in the way you think , and in the way you comfront each of your problems that life brings you , and if you open your mind to new possibilities you will have a lot of success in your life .
