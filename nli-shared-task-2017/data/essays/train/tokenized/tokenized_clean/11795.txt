i do agree on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .i would saz the word nowadays could be taken out .i can tell you from my personal expierience that this is not a new story .i was as well not a good kid in regards of helping our community .i always had the feeling that i do not have enough time to help .when i came home from school , i did my homework and than i went to my sport classes .i just was part of the group and went home again .i also wanted to spend time for doing nothing and just relax a little bit .there was not enough time to do something else .now i know that this is not true , as a kid you have a lot of time to do something for your community .i did only realize this when i began to work and i saw that i will have not that much time in future .i think the young people have the same problems as i had .they would like to spend their time for something more important for themselves .they do not realize that helping others would bring any benefits for them .therefore it is not only the fault of the young people that they do not taking some time to spend with their community , it is as well a problem of communication due to the fact that only adults could communicate from their own experience , it is their responsibility to take action .parents and teacher should talk the ownership on this and get the young people up to speed .if the parents would explain how important the communities will be for the future of their kids .there will be more interaction with the community alrady .teacher should raise this issue in their schools and maybe implement some community activities in their schedule .so that all kids could learn more about their communities and see by themselves that it is an important thing , so they will continue to participate in future activities .in conclusion , i would like to make the clear statement that everybody is responsible to help our communities and we should not pointing with the fingers to others .
