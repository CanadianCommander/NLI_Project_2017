survival in the fast moving technological era in today s world has become a ` rat race  .charles darwin s theory of ` survival of the fittest  is applied to its maximum in today s life style .man feels that - the more work that a person manages to do , the more he earns , the more he earns , the more his status in society rises .i strongly agree with the author s opinion .the younger generation is pushed into this concept unknowingly .they are forced from many sides to accept this strategy and to work accordingly .thus the young minds are manipulated into accepting things as they are and thus small pleasures of the world are soon forgotten .their minds adapt to this very fast and adhere to it too strongly .thus they donot find time to contribute and pay back to the very society that led to their success .there are many reasons for this .firstly , the ever demanding nature of trying to prove their mettle in becoming successful leave little time for the young to think about anything else .the madness of survival has even led to break up of the previously large families into atomic families .it has led to a mechanical or robotic state of mind where emotions , responsibilites , feelings , leisure have no place in one s dictionary .secondly , as the generations have passed the sense of responsiblity and concern for others has been dwindling down .it has become an egocentric world where everyone cares only for his well-being and his kith and kin .nolonger does anyone feel their duty towards the society and community that has brought them and made them what they are .thirdly , there are also situations were young people neither work for themselves nor for their society .they are a different class of people who lack any moral sense of values and a purpose in life altogether .such people need counselling in order to get back on the track of living life purposefully .this problem can be solved only by increasing the feeling of committment towards the society steadily since childhood .meeting elders , interacting with them , growing up among many children instil a sense of sharing and concern for others that will be carried on the later life .one of the most important things of all is being able to set aside time in any situation , any circumstance to give back to their community by organising welfare projects , adopting those who are less privileged and providing for the needy are various ways of not only helping the community but also to attain a sense of completeness .
