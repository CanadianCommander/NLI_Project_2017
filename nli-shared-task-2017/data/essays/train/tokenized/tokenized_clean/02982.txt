in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is certainly true .although today cars are the first choice of personal transport , it will be not in same in future .the time is changing the cities are becoming bigger and world is becoming smaller .now is the time people dont live in their own big houses they live in big buildings were every one share the same ground .the people dont work in there separate fields they work in tiny places called office .the pressure on cities is growing and the density of population is increasing .the estimate percentage of people living in cities and in village will be 50 % by the year 2050 .all this bring huge amount of pressure to the transportion system , whcih the cities like tokyo and newyork is seeing currently .the city transport system can not expand itself to accomodate space of each car for each individual .the future of transportation is mass transportation .the cities need to bulld their transportation structure around the metro trains and mono rails .there might be possibilty of private planes or some new kind of transport .today they say that new york and tokyo run as much as above the ground and underneath it .the crisis of fuel and the poulation issue may be handled by new invention but the problem of space will remain same in future also .the people travelling for day to day business will search for a cheaper and safer mode of travelling .the answer will be mass transport only .the car surely wont go out of market but will become a mode of leisure or fun .it will be a kind of thing which people will use in there weekends , just like bikes and hourse now .
