nowadays , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is extremely crucial but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject of interest .according to my past experiences and studies , i came to the conclusion that people who specialize in a specific subject are usually the ones who succeed in life .for instance , my cousin wanted to be an economist and before she decided which area she wanted to specialize on , her family members gathered and discussed what must be done eventhough my cousin specifically said that she really wanted to specialize in a certain field of economics .as the time passed her parents had no chose but to agree with their daughter .her decision of specializing on that certain area led her to get the most respected job in one of the prosperous companies in town .that was because she had much more experience and knowledge in that area whereas others who have studied economics as a whole did not have the same depth of information as my cousin did .the other reason why i have this point of view is that the subject that people usually specialize on is mostly the one that they like the most .for example , my school gives students the opportunity to choose between certain subjects and i ended up choosing economics and maths .this was because i liked those subjects the most and i knew that i would definitely do well in them .this opportunity led me to like the school more , have higher grades and also helped me to concentrate more on my subjects of interest .people who try to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects usually face tremendous amount of difficulties afterwards .this is because of the lack of concentration on the subjects that will further be studied by the student in the university .the most information we have the better .in the paragraphs above i tried to express why it is so important for students to specialize in specific subject eventhough i believe that there may be man
