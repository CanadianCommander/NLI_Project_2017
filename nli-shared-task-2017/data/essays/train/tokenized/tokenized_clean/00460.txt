some people may think knowing the facts is more important than knowing the ideas and concepts .some people may think in different way .what i suggest is that let student to understand ideas and concepts it is more important for students only to learn the facts .refer to the subjects i had study in high school , some of them i can not remember it clearly , some of them i still have the class picture in my mind .the different between these subujects is the subject i still have picture in my mind is what i had interest in .when people learning something having a interest in it is more effective than having a good teacher in the class .it is not because teacher is not important but because if someone have the interest in something this will help this person learn better .to understand the ideas could help the students to understand the subject more .like learning the language if someone have that language background already , it will help that person learn more effective .knowing something s working the idea like the background that person have .knowing the concepts likes a person has some experiences before him to study something .everybody knows have experiences before then to start something could help that person to really understant the subject alot than the first time .it is as same as someone had study a subject before , this personwill has more chance to earn a better mark .therefore , knowing the concepts can not be ingored .it is the basic step to get upper level .in my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than only for them to know the facts .usually for students facts are boring , like the meat other person had eaten before , students can not learn much about it .however , ideas and concepts like the fresh meat it is health and student will got a much interest in it .
