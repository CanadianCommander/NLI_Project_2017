i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities from the following three reasons ; ( 1 ) they have enough time , ( 2 ) they have little intention to do , ( 3 ) their communities do nt expect young people to do ,first , i believe they have enough time to helping their communities .because they have a lot of time to play and go anywhere with their friends .according to a certain survey , young people use 60percent of their private time with their friends , 20 percent with family , 15percent with collegues of their company and 5percent with their communities .second , they have little intention to helping their communities .they are little interested with staying with their communities .one of the biggest reasons is that they should follow their traditional customes .they are bothersome to young people .most young people want to stay with their friends using modern equipments , such as tv game .in addition , besides helping their communities , young generation have a lot of chances and places to be involved and help other communities and wider world , such as other countries and cities and communities .third , their communities also do nt expect young people to envolve into the events .because it is difficult both side to communicate well , teach something and stay together .sometimes to helping the communities might be botherd and harmful to their communities .in my case , as i did nt know how to do , i could nt help any thing to my community in the past .as a result , i did nt want to be involved into their events as much as possible .from the above reasons , i do nt strongly agree that young generation recent days do not give satisfactory time to helping and be involved into heir communities .
