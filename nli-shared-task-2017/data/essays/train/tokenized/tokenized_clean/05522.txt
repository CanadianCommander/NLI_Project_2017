when we know a specific topic or we discuss an argument , and we are well aware of what we write or speak about , most of the times we bring ideas , concepts and facts .the idea and concept are necessary to be able to define and describe a general concept .if we start any description , it is necessary that first we have a clear and defined general information about it and that we can put it above all the necessary explanations we have to give in support of it .many times we have to use many ideas or concepts to describe a specific argument , but it would never be clear to describe any topic , without the use of more detailed and clear explanation of the elements , that can only be brought with facts .let s think about history and let s try to rely only on general concepts about the history of romans : it is certainly very important to know that the romans have been conquerors , but it would nt be useful if we do nt support the information with more specific information , such as the time they passes teh alps or went to the sea and had the punic wars .in order to be clear , it is necessary to have a wide and clear vision of the elements of the discussion and that would be certainly represented by ideas and concepts , but in order to go deeper in the description , it is necessary to bring specific examples of what we are speaking about .in a literature class , it is necessary to know the main elements of the romanticism period in terms of concepts and ideas , but it would be impossible to understand the meanings of the genre if we do nt bring specific facts to surround the ideas , like who was the main representative of the period or what was written .students actually would use many of the facts to remember and support general ideas and concepts , that otherwise might be difficult to remember .i think that a stuudent should be able to understand facts and concepts , but it is necessary that he supports those general elements with specific facts .
