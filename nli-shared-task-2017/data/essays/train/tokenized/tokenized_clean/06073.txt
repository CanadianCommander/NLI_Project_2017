in this society succes plays a very important role .the definition of success is to be good at something and make money with that trade , or talent .some people have it easy and some people have to work a little harder for it .it is very important to be familiar with the subject of interest , however it is also important to try new things in different areas and take risks .a person can not truly know their potential , if they only stick with the trade they learned .if their potential of growth in that field has deminished and they are not successful they will never be successful .it is impossible for a person to be successful if they do not try anything new and drastic .it will always keep them in the same routine , and even in the same financial situation they are in today .a drastic change is needed in order to be successful because creativity can only come from change .it could be real estate , or even a bussiness .it is definately a good thing to take a certain amount of risks because if nobody would take any risks our economy would not be same today .the founders of various fast food places , coffee places , and grocery stores took risks to open their stores .imagine the world without starbucks , mc donalds , and wal mart for example .these are internationaly traded corporations , and very successful .trying new things like the idea of a drive through restaurant , for example , and taking risks in not knowing if it would be a success in the future , play a very important role in being successful .i
