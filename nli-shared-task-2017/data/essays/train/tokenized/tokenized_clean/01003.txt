the three main reasons i will talk about to explain why sucessfull people like taking risks are the fact that they trust themselves , that they like creting something from scratch and that they want to learn more and reach more money .i would like to analyse successfull people who are people who already had a good experience and who managed to face their challenge successfully .this is very important because those people know that they are able to handle complex issues .and this will give you trust and insurance that will help you not to doubt in unknown situations .see the example of cars manufacturer , you will easily attact a new market if you had been successfull on another one .for instance , bmw has few doubts about its success by developping its suv .then , there is the fact that people who had been successfull like , according to me , starting from scratch .this is something very exciting not to see the route you will follow and discovering stape by stape your environment .you can analyse people who create their own company .they can choose the kind of products they sell , the way they pay their employees , the way you deal with the customers and so on .and the most important point : you have no boss and you do not receive any orders thanks to the human size of your project .last but not least , people who succeed often know very well their domain ( this is why they succeed ) and this can explain their will to learn more about another field of technology .for example , a company like dassault which has made planes launched its own computer aided design software because it was able to afford it .and when you have been successfull in a field , you often earn lot of money which enable you to invest in new challenge .so this is , in my opinion , the three main reasons why successfull people like taking risks .because they trust themselves , because they know how to do and because they can do it .
