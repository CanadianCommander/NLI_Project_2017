there are certain reasons that contradict with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today as well there are arguments which support this thesis .to my mind this statement is not well reasoned and will certainly not become true in near future .first of all , cars provide an effective and cheap way of transportation that public transport for example is not able to give to its customers .driving a car , is more than a simple action , a strong emotion is involved of feeling free and flexible whereever you are in the world .people are dependent on this way of life , for instance getting to work with public transport in some areas is not satisfying .one could argue that crude oil and gas will not deliver the proportion which is required to enable car use in future .although this could be right , the car industry is already making efforts to develop new enginens based on solar and wind energy .furthermore , it is attempted to make the use of hydrocarbonite more economical and effective .all these developments will have an positive effect on environment because they contribute less to pollution .on the other hand , people can say that we should reduce car traffic by improving our national transportation system for instance to make it cheaper and more comfortable in order to attract more customers .another option would be to stress the importance of using plaines for small distances between towns instead of using the car .this obviously could all contribute to use the car not that often than nowadays .to sum it up , i strongly believe that the car is an integral part of life and its use will not decrease but increase in near future .there is no suitable option found yet which could replace the car and its great advantages .thus , let us do not abandon this extraordinary part of life but instead keep it and of course improve it .
