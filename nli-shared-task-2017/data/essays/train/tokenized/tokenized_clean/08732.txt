when the conditions of the today s academic and business environment are considered , it is a better idea to specialize in one specific subject than trying to get pieces of knowledge in many subjects .in the very begining of the evolution of science , many scientists used to deal with a variety of areas .for example , the ancient greek scientists were both mathmeticians and philosophers at the same time .it was true at that time when the conditions of the agricultural society was taken into account .there were very few people interested in science and they used to deal with many subjects at the same time .however , many several branches of science are formed in history with an effort to specialize in different topics .the today s world necessisates this progress .for example , as the computer tecnhology improved , different sorts of specialist began to emerge in this area .in my opinion , specializing in one subject gives you the chance to focus on this topic .for instance , you may have some knowledge about the hardware of computers , some about programming but you can not deal with a problem which envolves a huge knowledge and experience about a specific situation in one subject .if it was possible to learn all the things about many different subjects , people would do that .however , a life of a human being is not enough for this .favors of studying in many different academic subjects argue that it may give you the possibility conduct a research with different aspects of it .although these statement is partially correct , my suggestions would be conduct the same research with many specialists in different subjects .i believe that the second way would give better results taking the each individuals own specialization into account .
