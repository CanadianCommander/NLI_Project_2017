lets start with the statement `` successful people are not those whoe different things in the same way , but who belive in doing the same thing but in a different way  .i strongly feel and support that without taking any risks in life one can not expand his horizons .he will continue thinking and planning things in the same way which make his task less interesting and less challenging and at a point of time it might lead to frustration , for example when someone constantly keeps on typing the same format 100 times a day it becomes boring for him too continue it , instead if he tries out a better font style new colour combination or maybe a better matter to fill up the letter sheets then he is definately trying out something that makes a dull job as writting responce letters , interesting .the point is that it has taken a lot of risks and experimentations for many successful people to be where they are today .for example mr.donald trump whom i idealise myself has gone through so much and the people at the wall street who handle shares they have gone through major heartstopping risks .one has to make a geniune bold attempt with his ideas if he thinks they are worth and put them to a test , you can not learn how to swim without getting wet , you have to dive in !so in conclusion i ll like to add that it takes a lot of heart and courage to try out something new , and nothing can be more depressing than a failure but it is truly said that failures are the stepping stone to success so atleast try its better to learn and gain useful knowledge because that is the true identity of a successful person .
