taking a journey as a way to relax is very popular among modern people .some people like to travel by themselves without a tour guide , they think that it is more quiet and peaceful .as for me , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .but i disagree with considering it as a best way to travel .first , most of people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel .in some scenarios , it may very dangerous to traveler .for example , if you travel alone in a forest where the modern technology can not be used to communicate with outside world .imagine if you miss your way in the forest , meet some dangerous animals or get injured by accident , how would you continue you travel .in this situation , it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel .but if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .your friends can help you if there is really some bad things happened .and since there is a tour guide , the opportunity of occuring some bad things may decreases .so you can totally enjoy your travel without always worring about all kinds of situations .second , common sense tells us that human beings are social animals .so for most of people , they can get more pleasures by traveling in a group than by traveling alone .imagine , you and your friends in a travel , you can talk some funny things , you can share some feelings , or play card with your friends .people in group will make you travel more interesting , you have more things to do .however , if you travel alone without a tour guide , you are been deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends .however , i disagree with the claims that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .because the modern society provides us many opportunities to choose .some people can choose to travel by other way by their own option .but i recommend them to prepare enough and gather materials about their travel route carefully to resist potentially dangerous events that may happen to them .so , generally , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide as a very good way .since , you may get more pleasures .and the travel are safer to you .but i think that travel in other way is still a good way to some people by preparing well .
