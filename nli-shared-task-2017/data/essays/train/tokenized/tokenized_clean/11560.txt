some people tend to think that young people get more pleasure from life than older people do .in fact i dont agree with this view because i believe older people enjoy life more .if you are young you are probably a long way to settle your life .you will have many tasks and duties to complete before being able to enjoy life such as completing your education successfully , finding a good job , setting a family etc .these kind of burdens will prevent you taking pleasure form life because you will be worried about sorting out all those things .but if you are older it is likely that you already got rid of those kind of problems .all personal and financial matters would have probably been sorted out so that you could have the time and opportunity to enjoy life to the full .on the other enjoying life actually needs learning how to enjoy life .young people are likely to imitate their friends .instead of finding out what makes them enjoy life themselves they genereally do what their friends do , may be just to receive acceptance .to enjoy life they drink , smoke and do lot of other things without any serious justification of their results .but as you get older you become more experienced about what is good and bad for you .you can deliberately decide what to do to enjoy life because you probably learned from your past experiences .finally it can be concluded that older people are able to enjoy life more than young people do but it must be pointed that tyhis assumptions is valid only under a normal way of life without be pointed that
