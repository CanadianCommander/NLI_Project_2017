i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , mainly because today there are a lot of options available for younger generation for enjoyment .young people can get involved in various adventure sports .they can do scuba diving , trekking without getting too much worried about their health and fatiuge .however i do nt contend that older people do not get involved in adventure sports , but how many older people do we know who go for adventure sports as compare to the number of young people who participate in that .their are various night clubs that are specifically made for younger generation , which likes to chill out there after long working hours .and the number of young people their is more their as well .every generation is more advanced than the previous generation in terms of technology and variety .younger people have greater market in front of them , where they can buy things according to their own needs .market has become so competitive and shoulders that are responsible for innovation , have become youth centric .today s generation has access to various things that are now made primarily considering the youth of today .manufacturers of bike give advertisements of a youth riding attractive bike just to capture attention of younger generation .and seeing adverisments like this and buying the same product makes life more enjoyable .additionally , younger generation has access to all the forms of enjoyment that older generation has .some people might state that older people have more time to enjoy life , however , i am of the opinon that it s the quality time that matters .who has nt heard the words : ` work hard and party harder  .in the end i would like to conclude that younger people enjoy life more than the older people as the resources and options available to older generation are limited .
