twenty years from now , i feel that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .i personally feel that owning a car is a choice between the question of need and question of luxury .for most people now a days owning a car is no longer a luxury .with all sorts of loans and easy installments that have sprouted out of nowhere a common man can easily afford a car .but the question here is , is it really neccessary that we own a car ?in india atleast the answer is a yes .with the unreliability of the public transport systems , and unaccessibilty of some regions by public transports it becomes neccessary to have your mode of transport .but with the dawn of a new it era and hence the looking up of the brighter prospectives of the indian economy , the question of need is slowly diminishing .public transport has come back in its new and improved form , be it the local buses or the metros and it is even accessible in the remotest of the regions .as for the choice of luxury , the ever increasing hikes i petrol prices due to limited access to the petrol reserves would limit it owning of cars to people who can really afford them , and not the general public .globally , the importance of pulic transportation has already been concieved of , and has been in practice for decades .the modern generation being more aware of their environmetal issues of pollution and depleting fossil fuel reserves have aslo further established the need for better and efficient public systems , that would eventually cut out the depenency on personal vehicles for transportation .also with the decrease in fuel , the world all over is experiencing a hike in the prices of fuel which would make it more easier on the pockets of the common man if he used public transportation .with the ever increasing awareness of the lack of fossil fuel supplies that run most of the automobiles combined with the fact that the emissions from automobiles constitutes a major reason for the increase in pollution in recent times , i feel that the people would start depending on public transport instead of their personal vehicles .even though the possibilty of using alternate sources of fuel in the near future exists , its not going to come easy .the expenses for the use of such fuels would perhaps be as expensive if not more than the fossil fuels , not including the added expenses of manufacturing automobiles that can run on such fuels .the viable solution to this would be , as i feel , is to rely on the public transport , as it would prove to be more economically viable .the mode of transport for in the future as i see it is public transportation , which is not only fast but more economically and environmentally viable .hence with the increase in the technological advacement of the system cars with would be a thing of the past .
