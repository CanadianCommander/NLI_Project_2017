you can not know everything , that is a fact .but should we try to get a widely spread knowledge of many different topics rather than be a specialist in only one certain subject .in the end it depends on which solution is the best match with your personality .i am a medical student and i spend really a lot of time studiing but there are so much things to know about medicine that i can only learn a small part with my limited brain capacities .hence , i try to be at least a specialist in a certain area with determined outlines because a doktor who knews a little bit of evertything but nothing exactly is absolutely redundant .so in order to get a job i am inevitably forced to concentrate on a few certain topics .by contrast , i think that beyond the job , it is very important to have a widely spread knowledge of lots of different things .an urbane person should know many different things about other cultures , histories and literature , because in that time we are living in so much information and knowledge is offered to everyone .specializing would be insular in my opinion .as far as the knowledge beyond the job is concerned it does not make sense to try to know everything about one topic , because if you have a broad knowledge you have many topics to talk about with other people .for instance , i will try to teach my children things about world history as well as different languages so that they know a little bit of everything and can deepen their knowledge of these subjects they are most interested in single handed .in conclusion , i propose to specialize whenever it is neccessary , for the job for example as i already mentioned .beyond the job i prefer a broad knowledge of many different things , but that is a matter of personality . ..
