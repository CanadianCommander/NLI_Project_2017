in the next twenty years , the number of cars used will decrease in the more developed parts of the world , where it will increase in the less developed countries , i believe .the reason why i a behold such a viewpoint is due to taking into consideration firstly , the nation state s control of their country s public transportation policy and secondly , the fact that the thirld world or developing countries are getting more and more domains of exploitation for the huge transnational corporations ( tncs ) in our contemporary world .in other words , on the one hand while the more developed countries are putting forward legislations that favour more their public and their security , the less developed countries , tend to be more vulnerable to the harsh effects of the liberal capitalist economy .in other words , they tend to get more attracted to the advertisements that are shown on television , where due to these countries  peoples lack of education , as well as the weak government policies ( as a result of weak nation state ) they get tempted to drive carswhere the public transportation is rather poor .let me try to clarify my point by comparing my observation of two countries , that is , sweden and turkey .as sweden is a more developed country in economical terms and has accordingly a social state that serves for the benefits of its people , the public transportaion is used hugely ; especially the underground and the busses .however , it is not just the use of these public transportation but also the availability and quality of he service that is provided by the state , which is a factor that counts for the reason why swedish people prefer to use the public transportation more than the privately owned cars .on the other hand , although in turkey the public transportation is getting developed especially in the two big cities , that is , ankara and istanbul , it is still nothing compared to sweden .the busses do not have a timetable as in sweden or the railway is not as long and the lines are not as many as in sweden , which as a result makes people want to own and use cars instaed of public transportation .however , apart from such a case , it also holds true that in turkey people believe that nice looking cars affect their social status ( as the education level is rather law ) .in conclusion , the suggestion that the use of cars will be used less is not a `` black  and `` white  answer .it depends on the social , economic and political conditions of a country as well as its status within the global political economy .
