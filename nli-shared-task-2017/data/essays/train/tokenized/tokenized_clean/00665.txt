i agree that people who take more risks in life and try out new things are more successful than others .a good example for such a person is bill gates .he was one of the first people in the world to do research on computers and who developed the internet .introducing a new technology to the market is risky because of all the work , time , money and effort he put into it .nowadays every country in the world uses the internet to communicate .this shows that gates has had alot of success and that he is now the richest man on earth .therefore the risks at the beginning of his career have paid out very well .of course there are several people in the business world with a comparable history .another example of people taking risks are those who invest their money into stocks .the stock market ist proposedly the most risky way of investing your money .on the other hand , poeple who are successful at the stock market are at least ten times as succsessful as people that only do what they know best .with good stocks , you can make over 1000 percent the money you have invested in one day or even hours , while other people only get the same salary month after month .even people who already own a big amount of money do not simply let it be .especially these people let their money work for them in order to gain more and more .they also invest their money in maybe big , new , expansive and riskful businesses .but exactly through these investments they become even more successful .taking risks of course does not always lead to success , but the ones who try over and over again will in the end be the more successful .without trying , you will never know if the risk you want to take may lead to more success in life .therefore , the risk is definitely worth taking !
