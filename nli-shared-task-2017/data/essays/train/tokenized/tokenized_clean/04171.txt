i disagree with the statement .it seems to me that those who hold this kind of opinion limit the meaning of `` helping their communities  to activities that a traditional local community used to require of their members , helping neighbors , clearing away the roads with them , participating in the local festival , for example .however , since changes in society and life style made traditional comunities almost disappear , it is now difficult for almost all people , not only for younger generation , to be helpful to others in the traditional ways .this might seem a lack of interest in people other than one s own family and friends , but this is in fact not the case .people still feel the need to help others , and have begun to do so in a way different from that which was common in the traditional community .for example , instead of talking with their neighbors or relatives to solve the problem they have , they use internet to communicate with others who live in a distant area but share the same problem .this helps the vexed people more effectively than the traditional neiborhood community did .another example is the growth of communities of those who share the same hobby , cooking , photographs , travelling and so on .they also work as the substitution for the traditional local communities and provide people with the oppotunity of making friends of different status and different age .perhaps the most important instance of people helping others is the existence of many volunteers in the time of earthquake , flood and other disasters .there is , i think , no need to mention that many young people participate in these new kinds of activity of helping others .
