the statement refers to the difference between understanding and illustrating .i partly agree with this statement .being able to analyse as well as understand ideas and concepts is a crucial part of academic achievements .understanding concepts do not only confers students the ability to analize a situation but also to adapt this concept to other contexts .indeed , the role of a concept is to provide a broad base of understanding .this intellectual exercise is part of the process that enable the student to switch from theoretical considerations to practical considerations .this process is possible only through the concepts .consequently i think that we should consider concepts as more important regarding the fact that they are part of a constructive process .we have seen above than the concept is a precious tool for the understanding process .however , this tool must first be understood in itself .and at this stage , factual elements remain crucial .a concept is reliable only if it is illustrated by facts .therefore , i consider as also important that students learn facts because it represents the only way to understand concepts .for example , a concept has no value without a broad factual basis .therefore , facts are important too for students .as a conclusion , i would say that understanding concept is more important for students as a way to be able to analyse a situation .however , factual elements seem crutial as a way to understand concepts .my consideration on the comparative importance of the two elements would be to consider them as part of a unique process .thus , considering concepts without any references to factual elements seems useless .also , considering facts without joining it with concepts make any global operative approach imposssible .
