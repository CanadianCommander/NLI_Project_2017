i agree with people try new things and take risks .successful people s methods are only referance to get an amergency situation .even if we are failed , we have to try to get a new things .this is a real life .if people do nt try anything about something , everything will be the same over and over .also , all of people will follow someone who did it .if so , people want to get something oneself without another people .everthing will be getting to mass up and lazy .when people try to do new things , people realize something about result .it does nt matter of good thing or not .of course , successful people tried new things .we have to always find out by oneself .otherwise , we are sick and tired of living in the world .
