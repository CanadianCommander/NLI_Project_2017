which is better , to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs or to specialize in a one specific subject ?the answer really lies in the context in which you are speaking .if you are still in school then it is always better to have a broad knowledge of all other subjects .just imagine what a person will become if he study only biology his whole life .he will never become a doctor , let alone a successful doctor .there are some subjects or fields of study which are necessary or form a base for further studies in any field .you can never succeed in life as a doctor if you do nt have any knowledge of chemistry or maths .we do need elementary knowledge of all the subjects to truly appriciate the subject in which we want to specialize .but at the same time we can not expect a person doind phd in biology to know about difficult topics in mathematics like calculus .infact , the matter of fact is that as we move towards higher education , we should tend to concentrate on less and less subjects .a person studing engineering , will usually do away with the subjects of history and geography in college , but will still embrace physics and chemistry which are more relevant for him .a person doing specialitaion must have pretty good knowledege of the subjects which are going to help him and facilitate him in his reaearch even though they are not directly related to his field of specialization .in conclusion i would like to say that we need a balance of both the forms .one one hand , in order to really understand and enjoy a subject we need to specialize in it , but at the same point we can not afford to neglect other subjects .a good combination of both broad knowledeg as well as specialized knowledge will make a truly knowledgable person .
