it is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .some people might agree with this statement because of the probability of innovation by trying new things .however , i disagree with this statement in that knowing how to do well is as much important as trying new one , and doing familiar is more secure than taking risks .first of all , doing what people already know is very important as much as trying new one .people who do only what they already know how to do well often lead them to be an expert of their fields .because they do the same work repeatedily , they may know many useful information of the work .for example , my uncle is an owner of a restaurant .the restaurant had succeeded from his grandparents , and my uncle has workd there for his entire life , and he did nt try to do new things even though he felt bored with the work .now , his restaurant is very famous traditional restaurant in my city , seoul , s.korea .he knows well the recipes of the menu , and sometimes teaches the skill to his workers .in addition , when it comes to the safety of work , doing familiar things guarantees more stable life .some might say that many innovative inventions were from the trial new things and taking some risks .however , the successes were very small parts of the trials .much more people have failed at those trials and risks .moreover , many successful professionals like doctors and lecturer have shown that their skillful work style was the key of their successes , but not just trying new and innovative things .their work is very safe as well .in conclusion , it s not bad to try new things and find other ways in their fields , but it is not the best way to succeed in their fields .this is because the importance and safety of doing what they already know how to do well can not be underestimated .
