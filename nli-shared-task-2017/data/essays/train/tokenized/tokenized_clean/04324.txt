the given statement is , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .most of the people agree with this statement as the present generation has much advanced environment for entertainment and lots of new places to hang out in groups .i like to disagree with the statement .as i have mentioned in the earlier paragraph , it might seem as if younger people enjoy life more than older one does .but that is not true according to my concern .in the present generation one could notice that the technology have been improved and has lead to the next level in advancement .this , in addition increases the studies in science and in other areas .in order to compete in the world , young people have to study more and automatically spends more time working , in order to improve the skills .i would like to add the phrase , work hard and enjoy later .if a person enjoys life in his young age , he definitely can not compete with the future generation and hence suffer in his old age .but in the case of a person who works hard in the young age , can make good fortune so that he would lead a safe and peaceful life in the later age .also .only at the young age , people would be physically fit compared to to the aged ones and furthermore have good stamina to do hardwork .i would like to add a real time example to support my statement .all the personalities whom we have hear d and come across in our life would have worked hard in their early ages .i think everyone would accept this fact .i would like to point out a person known to me who is leading a happy and fortune life .in his early age , he use to work at textile factory based on daily wages .there he studied his work keenly and worked hard so that he became permanent employee and got promoted .later with his knowledge , that he gained from his experience he started an individulal unit outside that manufactured the spare part which the company is , frequently in need of .now he is one of the major supllier of spare parts for that company .any person who lives prosperous life and who is assumed to be one of well known personality would have worked hard in their earlier life .thus working hard in early time gives fruitful results that makes people enjoy ther later life period .
