i think the best way to travel is in an group of people led by a tour guide becouse traveling will be more confortable to all of us and we all will get the information of the places we visit .in the other hand traveling alone will be more expensive that traveveling in an group , costs will be split for all travelers .i remember one time i traveled alone to mexico city and my money was really short but took the risk and i travel .then when i was in the city i realized that the best will be traveling with someone .i spent the ninght with some friends becouse i had not enougt money to retourn to my city , then next time that i consider to tavel by my self would not be a option .traveling in an group not only have the economic benefit , you can meet people and have an nice long trip chating with new friends .i met someone in a tour to acapulco , and we all have fun i still have touch with them but they are nt in mexico anymore .the best way to have my next vacation will be by having a tour guide , they may know more the city that i do , in fact that s is their job , to show up the city and indicate the best way and places to spent time .i will recoment to have a tour guide , family will have much fun that getting lost looking for some place in special .that is really usual when get parents think that they already know about the place they will visit .i agree with this point and will not get any tour by my self , not if i do nt the exactly information .
