education has been avitally aspect of human life .people are born then firstly want to learn or do something .therfore , learning is the best point in this statement .i do not agree that to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in terms of the two most remakable factors are emotion and necessity .the first and most significant factor is emotion .it is true .people need learning something .it is an emotinal action .therfore , emotion is very important for student .for example , a business student want to ask a question about economics so the student just want to learn how about this title .it is the prime factor of learning is important for students .the secondary very important factor is necessity .we have to learn how we can be alive .since the old centuries , people have researched and they learnt how we can survive .learning is necessary for our life .actually students have to know much knowledge about their major study courses .students especially must to learn everything about theit depertmants .i give an example that if a doctor did not know how he/she helps a cancer problem , probably the doctor can not be a real doctor .learning is necessity for all students .taking these things which are emotin and necessity are most important factors about my disagreement .to learn facts can be provide good education for students .consequently , understanding ideas is important but learning facts is more important for students .we can see this thing our whole life .
