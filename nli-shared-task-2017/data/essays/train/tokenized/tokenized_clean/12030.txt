i agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .those who were did something well tend to challenge for new things because they think that they will be good in other things .the risk is not important thing as they succeed .that s why many successful people do new things even if they take risks .when i went to japanese middle school in japan , i had joined gymnastics club .i like gymnastics because i liked gradual steps to get new skill , and i can have successful feeling after i practiced the skill many times and did it .if i suceed in one skill , i could practice more difficult skill which may take risks , such as injure .i always tried to challenge new skill because i want to get the skill and show my friend how i am great .i did not care about the risk because i thought if i think about the risk , i can not do anything .the novel , great business , by kyoko mori shows how the certain businessman succeed and become boss of his company , although he was bottom of status at first .tsukasa worked very hard for his family .as he worked many hours without any absents and his grade was the highest among the collagues .one day , he was suggested by his previous boss that he should be the boss of his company .although he was uneasy since he need more responsibility to be the boss .however , finally , he decided to be the boss .he did nt mind the risk and become more successful person .success often lead to another steps that people have never did .that s important thing for people s live .people can not afraid of taking risks .they always have to challenge to do anything .
