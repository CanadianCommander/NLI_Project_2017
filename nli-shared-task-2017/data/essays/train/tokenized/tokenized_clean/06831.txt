gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study .but how should a person get new information ?in my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding ideas and concepts of something .by learning facts , you can get only a small impression of how something works , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail .so by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person .when some facts are only learned they are not aquired .by knowing concepts of something the things , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge .in a lecture was sayed that a person forgets every seven years the half of its learned facts .therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate facts from their knowledge .so a huge knowlegdege of facts can be made by understanding things .but the other direction is not easy .another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts .so , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster .after studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts .by knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts .this ability makes researches faster an more successful .
