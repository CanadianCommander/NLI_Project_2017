i completely agree with the given statement .it is indeed far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts in general than it is for them to simply learn facts .i believe so for several reasons , however , my main argument behind these reasons is the importance of flexibility and creativity for dealing with problems in a changing world .if students are taught static knowledge , they can only learn a limited amount of facts , which might not prepare them for problems they will have to deal with during their work .learning to understand ideas and concepts on the other hand , allows them to gain new knowledge whenever neccessary .it provides them with a more general skill that can be applied in all kinds of situations and to solve all kinds of unanticipated problems .i think this sort of general skill and flexibility becomes ever more important in these fast changing times .the value of knowledge understood in terms of facts more and more decreases .in the face of contemporary scientific progress , what is held to be fact and truth today may well turn out to be untrue tomorrow .the preperation provided by university can not be very specific .students of the same subject are likely to work in different sectors later on .it is often said that learning in fact begins after graduation .the relevant `` hard facts  required for a certain work are anyway more likely to be acquired during working .so , concentrating on learning facts in most cases means memorising a lot of facts which will never be of use .in contrast , concentrating on learning concepts creates flexiblity for a variety of tasks , for changing biographies , for a changing world .flexibility is in the contemporary world a major key to success .it is therefore a crucial skill of university graduates to be able to find solutions to all kinds of problems which might occur by applying knowledge in a flexible and creative manner , based on the more general ideas and principles they have gained understanding of during their studies .
