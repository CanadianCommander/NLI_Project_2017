i do nt agree with that statement .it s better to have a specialized knowledge about one subject .i think you can be really good on one or two subjects but if you want to have a very good knowledge for many subject you have lot of work to do and in my opinion it s just not possible to be perfect in many subjects .there are not many genius in this world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfied when you know very much about one subject .i m a specialist in history and german literature but if you want to know something about biology you have to ask someone else .today there are no `` universal genius  anymore .hundrets of years ago there were some guys who knew very much about totally different subjects .but today it s too complex , to many informations to know - that it s quiet impossible .i want to study journalism and the student counsellor told me that it | s better to specialize on one subject than just study general communication .of course it | s very good to have a good knowledge about what  s going on in this world but the magazines like it when you are a specialist in politic or maybe history .i also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are specialized on one subject .if you are very good in speeches you could become a teacher or a translater .if you are really brilliant in math , physics , geography , history and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improve all your knowledge .this theoretical knowledge is worthless if you are not able to work in the praxis .my mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subjects , especially for me . ..
