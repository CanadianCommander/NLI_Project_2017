it discussed that these days , the youth do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree with the statement .compared to past , yougn people do not have enough time to help their communities .it is partly due to change of social envrionments .this esay will discuss two reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities in based on social changes .first of all , living costs are getting higher than past .consequently , young people have to work hard and improve their skills .for example , in last 50 years , buying a house is not cost alot compared to nowadays .they do not try to make more money to buy a house but they also want to spend money for their entertaintments .most of young people enjoy traveling around country or even overseas .they take more time to having hobby or enjoy their life .moreover , they also improve their knowledge wich is quite related to their job such as computer skills or learning other language in their spare time .they do not have choice to work hard to living well and a society requires the ablilities from young people .secondly , young people do not concern their communities unlike past .it is because that the social envrionments are changed .in the past , members of community spend time with their neighbers like a big family .it is because that they work together to farming or work in the smae company .however , these days young people are more concerns about themselves than their communities .they do not go to the same company or even same school .developing of communication technologies make possible to communicate with many people including living in distant area .ironically , due to the developed technologies such as internet or video games which most of young people like those people lose time to interact with members of communities .they can call them or meet up on internet .because of this social mood , young people do not take care about communities .in conclusion , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities due to .however , it is not only fault of young people .it is because of the social changes .the living costs are rapidly increasing and social moods are changed to care about more individual issues .in my personal oppnion of this , local communities should try to bring more concern from the young people to help their communities .
