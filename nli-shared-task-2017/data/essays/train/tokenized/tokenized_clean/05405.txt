the world we live is full of variety and diffrences between people .we share diffrent cultures , diffrent traditions , diffrent jobs , diffrent responsibilties .everybody is diffrent for the others in his ways of expressing life .the world is a huge stage and nearly everybody is an actor .to be able to communicate with each others we should know about each others intresets , this is mainly based on what we aquir in our academic life .it s a vaste subject list .it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects simply because the society requieres the variety , requieres the change between all living humains .this is to lead us to communication and communication is to lead us to knowledge .immagine a persons life specialized in one specific subject only .no variety , no communication , no expanded knowledge .tyhis is the type of persons who communicate with there ressemblance only , or in most of the times they become `` the outsiders  .complete isolation of the society , and this may lead to a public danger , or to suicide .it s then prefarable to be an open person .meeting diffrent persons with diffrent intersts and charing diffrent aspects of life .image a man specialized in complexe physics and only complexe physics , can you draw a life for this kind or people ?it s very difficult for him to built a family , to communicate with his wife , children , neighbors , friends .one step after the other they will turn to isolation , live and work outside society and thus a failure of life .we live in a absurde world with so much of diffrent desiers and intrestes .i herebly agree with the statment above .it s much better to have a broad knowledge pf many academics subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .life is an adventure , we live once , we should do what we feel is rite to do .we re like an flower , said descart , we grow and acquire knowledge we feel we re kings of the world , as we grow more we realise we know just a little of the perplexe and complexe world , we then start to become humble , and die .
