recently , it is said that young pepople do not give enough time to helping their communities .i agree this opinion , because young people of nowadays are so busy of their own things , and they are poor ability of communication , and they regard the community as not so important .on the first , young people is very busy , because they need to go to prepschoop after school .in japan , the end of primary school , there are entrance examination to the junior highschool .so they need to study hard .moreover they learn many kind of things , for example , tennis , swimming , piano , something like that . ..after enter university , they are busy to social life such as the party , part-time job , the date . .there are no time to spend for their communities .secondly , young people do not know how to communicate with the many kind of people .usually they are grown up small familly , so they are not good at communicate another people except their familly or school mates .so it is difficult to communicate for them .thirdly , young people regard the community activity as not so inportant .some of them are busy for theirselves , so they think that it is useless to attend the community s activity .in these reason , i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is pitty , but it is real situation in japan .
