ideas , concepts and facts are very important part of a students curriculum .a good student always looks for inventing new things or desires for conducting new research in his field of study .for this he always looks for new ideas and concepts .i prefer ideas and concepts are more important for student rather than facts .an idea can change ur life .we all new why newton was famous .he was sleeping beneath a apple tree when suddenly apple fell from the branch , he thought over it about why apple fell down , why didnt it go up , this concept or this idea led to the famous theory which we know as newtons law of gravity .see what an idea can do , it created history and those who look for new ideas and concepts wiil definitely create history in their future course .so understanding the concepts and ideas will help a student drastically .for any student irrespective of his field of study he has to use his own ideas .for instance a student who has joined a graduation course in the field of space explorations , he has to produce a thesis on the related subject which should be obviously a new and an intresting one .for this altough he has to collect data from previous facts , he has to incorporate his own dimensions or views of the subject what he has learned so far .for example the space scientists have to find out ways and means to preserve food as their expeditions require a 2-3 months stay in space where the conditions doesnt suit for preserving the foods .the student has the chance to innovate a perfect preserving condition and for this , apart from the data he collects from facts he has to put forward new ideas and concepts to materialise this .this can be achevied if the student clearly understands the ideas and concepts which hve been taught to him by the professors or wherever he gets information from .thats the reason i strongly prefer that students should understand the ideas and concepts very well rather than just learning the facts .learning the ideas and concepts will definitely diversify the knowledge of students and they would be capable enough for their future endeavours .learning and using ideas are very important in any one s life .
