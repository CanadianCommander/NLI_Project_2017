people respond to this issue differently .in my opinion , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities .as a young girl , i do nt think that i can give enough time to help my community .here comes some reasons .first of all , young people nowadays have more vivid personalities than decades ago .in this situation , young people try their best to be themselves and do everything they want to do .so they may have fewer time and may be unwilling to helping their communities just because they think it is stupid or rediculous if they help thier communuties .in other words , they think that helping their communitis is not the thing that a young man should do .for example , young people in my country indicates that young people should go outside and try something new and exciting , not just stay at home or in communities .participating activities of communities is the thing that old people do .although this may not be a correct idea , it really influence youin addition , as advanced technology is invented and applied , there are more and more activities that young people can do .but we only have 24 hours a day and it led to a fewer time to hepling our communities in contrast .for example , we can go see a movie or go riding , go kloofing , or even attand to a big computer game competition .there are too many things for we young people to try and to experience .that is , we can hardly get eough time helping our communities because there are more and more interesting and exciting activities that appeal to us .to summarize , young nowadays really do nt give enough time to help their communities .but this does nt mean that we do nt love our own community , afterall , there are too many things enchant us .we have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to us and this may help us to learn more and experience mor from it .
