i think having knowledge of many academic subejects is better than specializing in one specific subject .there are two reasons and examples why i agree with this statement .if you have knowlege of general information , it would be useful in your life .for example , if you work at the office and your boss asks you to write report , your knowledge would help you .because you have different kind of knowledge , you can think from different views .if you only have specific knowledge , you can only focus from one view which would make your report pretty poor .knowing about many different things would help you at the school as well .for example , because you have broad knowledge of many academic subejects , it would be useful at many situations , such as the examination and the interview .at the examination , surely you would get good grades because you have a lot of different knowledge , even though it does not specialize in one specific subject .also at the interview , because you have different types of knowledge , you can answer the questions widly and you can appeal how you understand general today s events and your cleverness as well .if you have knowledge which focuses on only one subject , it would be useless at many situations .for example , at the school , even if you would get full mark at the math test , perhaps you would fail with other subjects because you only have specific knowledge on mathmatics .in my opinion , because having different types and kinds of knowledge , it would help you to live much better .because of those reasons that i said before , i agree with the statement which is it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
