life is not a one subject thing .as i learned during my high school , we need to have a broad knowledge , to see things as a whole .in life everything is a consequence , interrealtions between different areas of knowledge .you shouldnt limit yourself to one area .i studied in an interdisciplinary program , which has as main objective to see knowledge as a whole by making conections between differents subjects having as main axe history .i found it so much more interesting this way .you can understand why things happened , per example the relation between music , art and war in the second half of the xx century .if you see each of this areas alone , you will have an incomplete version , because you are taking the situations out of their context .also if you focalize your stuides in only one area .you are limitating your vision of the world .because there is no point in knowing everything about one topic .you will be missing so many things .in my case , i like more than one subject .i dont want to choose only one .why are we forced to specialize in one subject , if at the end we will need more than one .thats why i decided to follow a university carreer in which i can choose any class that i like , regardless the area .another example of why we should know about several knowledge branches , is when we interact with people , per example in a dinner .a person who only knows about one topic will be bored .but if everyone knows a little about different areas , they can have an interesting conversation in which everyone can interact and discuss .touching different topics avoiding monotomy .i believe you need all types of knowledge per example math , that is one of the subjects that is usually disliked .if you go to the supermarket you need to know to make sums , to at least be able to make the numbers .you will face huge difficulties in life if you dont know at least something from every subject .i believe everyone should be able to have a conversation in more than one topic .i believe that only the difference will help you broad your mind .and making connections helps to understand life better so you will never get bored .
