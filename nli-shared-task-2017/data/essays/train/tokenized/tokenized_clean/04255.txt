in my essay i am going to explain why i agree with he statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .first i would like to say that success could also be connected with earning a lot of money .successful people are in the case to try new things out because they are already rich .they also do not have to think about what will happen if the new thing , whatever it is , will not work or will not be so successful .they are able to lean back without caring that they probably had lost a lot of money .they also dare trying out new things because they do not believe that they would lose something .to support my view i want to show it through an example .if a business man would open a restaurant , just to do something different , and the restaurant will not be visited from any person , he will not think about that he had invested his money wrong .probably he will believe that nevertheless it was worth it to try it out .besides successful people are really getting tired of doing the same thing over years and years .they want to risk something and want to have more excitement in their lifes .only people who are successful woul dare it .the reason for my opinion is that if people had felt success once in their lifes , then they become greedy of having more and more success .they believe that no matter what they will build up , it will become successful .these aspects are leading to my point of view , why i believe that only successful people are taking risks and are trying out new things and why success plays an important role on that statement .
