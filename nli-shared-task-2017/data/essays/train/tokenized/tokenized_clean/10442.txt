nowadays , the more the students are educated , the deepest knowledge they will have on their subject .however , some of them may have two majors .which idea is good ?in this essay , there are several reason why i do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .first of all , everyone has got the same time .in other words , the condition to have an amount of study may be the same to everyone .if you spend all your time on a specific subject , you can impove a lot rather than the person who spend his or her time on two subjects .this is because he or she should devide the time .let us assume that there are two students and the same time is offered : a person who only does economics and b person who does economics and politics .compared with a person , b person would know about politics more .however , a person would know about economics more deeply than b person .secondly , in the sense , broad knowledge of many academic subject can be useful for normal lives .however , you would lose the competetion with others who specialize on a particular subject .a firm is a group of all the specialized people on their people .in the other words .there are several teams and sub-organizations classified in a firm .it does not need one who has got narrow knowledge .for instance , every unversity has got many departemts and wouldaccept the person who really want to specialize his or her faviourite subject .
