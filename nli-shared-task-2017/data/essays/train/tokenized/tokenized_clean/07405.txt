i am essentially agreed with this statement .understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .but in my opinion they must learn facts too .as far as i am concerned one thing implies the other .if a student does not understand ideas or concepts , he will not be able to learn facts in a proper way .we shall see this clearly with an example .if a student has to learn for his history exam the main events of the french revolution , he can just study the main facts ( such as king s prison and death and robespierre s government ) but if he does only this , he will forget them easily , even before the exam .what he should do is trying to understand the causes of the revolution .if he knows that french people was almost starving while the queen made costume-parties at palace , he may be able to understand why the furious inhabitants of paris took `` la bastille  , france s most important jail and , consequently , he will remember easily the fact itself : the assault of `` la bastille  .it is true that in earlier times , when my parents studied for instance , the students were told to learn facts .professors paid almost no attention to ideas or concepts .nowadays , it is quite the contrary .at school , and even now , at university , we , as students , are supposed to be aware of ideas and concepts , but not of facts .they are misregarded , as unimportant information .i think that a really good education ought to cover both concepts ( which are basic to understand the causes of facts ) and facts themselves .if we do otherwise the only thing we achieve is a partial idea of what we learn .in order to clarify it more , i will give another example connected with the french revolution .if we know that `` la bastille  was assaulted at 1789 , that fact signifies nothing , it is only a number .if we know that french people was upset with the king and queen in the later years of the 18th century we do nt know that at this moment the assault of `` la bastille  took place .we must be familiar with everything in order to get a deep , a complete knowledge of the matter .
