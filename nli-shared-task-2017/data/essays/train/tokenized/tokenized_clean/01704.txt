i agree with the statement but in my opinion it also depends on your study and your individual way of learning .for an example if you are studying history it is very important to learn the facts , too .even if you can explain how e.g. kennedy became president of the united states , you should be able to present facts to this topic , too .if you are a math student you would have to learn very hard to pass through exams just by learning facts .you would have to proove theorems in tests and learning all of the prooves would take a long time .if you are able to understand a proove s context it is easy to complete the full proove correctly .but in math you have to learn the definition and theorems , too .in a test there is not enough time to reproduce every little `` fact  fastly .it is indivdual if you like more learning facts or the main concepts and ideas .there are students which are able to learn facts and remember them very fast and others would have problems and must repeat them again and again .when you just concentrate on the learned facts it will often be hard to get the main concept .a student should learn the facts and think about how the connections are between them .if he understands why he is learning all of them he will be able to remember the facts better .a student will improve more and in his class if he repeats everything he has learned .to summarize all the ponits , i think that it depents on every student to find the right method to learn .to be good you have to understand the concepts and ideas but without recalling any facts that is not enough .
