why is it a problem ? .there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years and i think that it would be a great advantage .this fact woul be fantastic for the world environment .the lack of cars implies that the pollution decreases .and it will suppose the appearing of new vehicles and people will have to get the public transports or another way of moving .riding would be a good sustitute in order to this situation .the problem is that new transport will appear too and not all people will be able to buy it because of its price .only the people who have money will get the ` future transport  or may be that the really ` future transport  will be the bycicle . ..nobody know this yet .on the one hand , we have all these points but on the other hand it implies that many people who work in facts making cars or people who sell them , people that deal with cars will have problems .may be they lose their job or something like that and it would be a really great problem .if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today people will walk more and make more sport which helps their body to be fine .as advantage we wo nt see so many traffic problems in the future , i hope , and the accidents will decrease too .in conclusion , i think that it will suppose a lot of changes in our lifes .it
