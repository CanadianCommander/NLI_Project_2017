the influence of marketing in our societies has been enormous in the last few years .the practice of publicity also has changed dramatically .from my point of view , companies exaggerate the personalities of their products in an outlandish way .this is unfair for the consumers who believe in the authenticity of the advertisement and the message that buyers are getting are not true .first , people most of the time are getting messages through the media that something is really well develop and its quality is not comparable with nothing else .this is not right as people think that the message send to them is honest , thus they believe whatever they heard .this is like playing games with the people .second , when people face reality , it is when they go to buy an item , then they are realized that what it is offering to them is not what they have shown to them .their reality come true as something of very bad quality and the price ask for such item is awkfaully expensive .people realized that the message was just an scam in order to get their attention and then go to buy that good .finally , people who use advertisements this way , they are very dishonest with their buyers .so , nowadays we have to be very careful about what companies offer us in flayers , newspapers and tv .it is very easy to get someone attention offering the most wonderful and perfect items in the world , but it is what we are getting .overall , people who advertise , they do not regards other people as soon as they will be able to obtain whatever they want .it is their final purpose , regardless the consequences .this is a very popular way to get people .thus , i agree with the above statement .
