it s the travel time , do you prefer travel alone or with a group led by a tour guide ?a good question , i would not hesitate to go with a group led by a tour guide .there are too many advantages to travel with the group led by a tours guide .first , the efficiency issue .we are busying on studying , working or anyother things , or you even can not imagine how we can spare ten or more minutes to google all the travel information and accomadation .preparation of travel is a time-consuming process , and it may get you stressed out when there s no hotel room or air ticket available on a particular day .if it s with a group led by a tour guide , no worries , they arrange every single detail for you in advance .so they reduce your effort and save your energy .second , the safety issue .if we travel alone , we may choose driving for sightseeing among nearby place .as we know , people are fatigue when they travel around , in the meantime , their focus on driving is distracted by views or landscapes outside of the car window .car accident probability during travel time ranks the top among other accidents situation according to our national survey .i was involved in the exactly same situation once when i drived with my boyfriend , that s a nightmare , you may never want to experience .third , the travel perception issue .it s no doubt that tour guides are real experts for explaination of tour sites .as we may experienced , you are more exposed to the thorough information about specific place than you travel alone .in addition , the tour guides are more informed about regulations or price change for relative sighseeing issue , therefore we can avoid some useless rush .that s why the tourist industry keep booming these years in our city for these 4 consecutive years .nevertheless , we embrace all intrinsic advantages of traveling with group led by tour guide , we may still have some pity for its inconvenience and comfortable concern .we are not allowed to go wherever we feel like to go since it s hard for tour guide to organize a huge group , we follow tour guide s preference other than our owns .also , sitting in a tour bus with 40 people interrupted by any of their snoring or other noise seems not as enjoyable as driving my own car with my friends .even so , i still would jump up to choose travel with a group led by a tour guide if i were given a chance to select comparing with travel alone , and it s obvious advantages outweigh its shortcomings , travel with the group led by a tour guide can also foster our networking opportunity during the trip and may learn across culture .what a good chance to know people beyond the above attractive conditions !
