over the pass serval years , there is an common phenomenon that teachers in high schools , or even in the elementry schools try to make up the idea of teaching students concepts on some hard courses .however , do the students have the high understand of the concepts without the facts of the ideas and statements ?as far as i am concern , it is more important for strudent to learn facts than it is for them to just understand ideas and concepts due to the interest , senses , and assistance of understanding the concept .in the first place , learning facts of the statement is more interesting than for students to understand and then memorize the concepts accurately .usually , the ideas and concepts are word-for-word stated on the text book and most students do not understand it without teacher s explaination .this explaination is required from the teachers offering the facts , which are related tothe concepts on the text book , are easier to understand and memorize .for example , to understand the concept of the first law of conservation energy - no energy is destroyed or produced in the tranformation of energy , students would choose to understand the facts that the energy has different types of energy such as potential energy and gravitational energy .also , an interesting diagram which contains how eneryghg is being transfer would be helpful for students to unterstand the first law of conservation energy .moreover , common sense of facts for understanding a complicated concept is useful for students .students would use what they see and think in daily life to understand everything they have difficulities with .for instance , students would understand the water property of adhesion in the example of the water strikes walking on the surface of the water .in biology , learning facts of all the living things are very important for the student to success since the biology is all based on the fact of lives .on top of that , the reason why i disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them for learn facts is because learning facts are also help students easier to understand the ideas of the study .as mentioned above , it is very helpful to learn the facts than to learn the basic concepts .in conclusion , it is more important for students for learn facts in the mordern
