if you ask people , who have success in their work , to change the work and do something else or go to another country , they will not be afraid of doing this .because they have success and want to be more successful .so i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .people who have success want to be more successful by doing more things and especially different things in order to show that they are successful in every branche .they may have a complex or so but they think they have to show everybody that they are successful in their work .some people would change the country to be more successful in their life .for example the person is very successful in europe and now wants to be also successful in america .step by step this person will work and do everything to be more successful and to show the word that he / she is a grand person .so that the person can be proid of herself / himself .in some cases families will be destroyed because the parents want to be successful .having nothing in the mind only to be successful in life , parents could forget their children .they do not forget their children but they do not see the importance of their children and that they need love and other things like that .with leaving the family a person risks a very big importance in the life because to have a family is one of the biggest and best things you ever would get .and why should a successful person do something that he or she already know how to do it ?in my opinion this would not be interesting for a successful person because these people want to be more and more successful in there work and every part in there life .so they have to discover ther things that are for they unknown to show uo other pe
