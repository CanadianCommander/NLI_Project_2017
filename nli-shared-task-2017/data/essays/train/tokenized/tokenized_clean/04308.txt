today , travelling has became one of the most important entertainments for people to relax or borden their views .most people do their travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but is that the best way to travel ?i will not give not an answer such that either completely yes or no , because this depends on the situations of different types of people .having a tour guide can be benificial .first it ensures better on travellers  safety .people such as children and elders should definitely be taken care by a tour guide .we can not expect our 10-year-old daughter or 60-year-old grandmother to travel on their own , in this situation they should travel with the help of tour guides .second , most travllers are new to the place they visit and do not have a very good understanding about it , a tour guide therefore will be helpful in introducing the place and making sure the traveller can enjoy at the most extend during the vocation .however , there are diavantages of travelling with a tour guide , too .what comes first is the lack of freedom , especially when our traveller are young and independent .me as a young and curious woman , for instance would rather travel with my own friends , so that i will not restricted by the guide and have more fun .second , from the aspect of scheduels , plans that tour guides provide may not satisfy people s desires .different travellers have different tastes and preferences , and as a group there might be conflicts between memebers .so when it comes to the matter of freedom and flexibility , travelling with a tour guide will not be a wise decison .to sum up , whether to travel with a tour guid or not does depend on people s own situations .they need to weiht their preferences to decide if a tour guide is helpful or not .
