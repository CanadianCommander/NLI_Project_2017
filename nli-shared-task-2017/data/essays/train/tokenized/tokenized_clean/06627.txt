many students believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i am afraid i completly disagree with this statement because of several reasons that i will clearly explain .the first reason is because having knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful only if you do not plan to work .think about it .if in the real society , in the real word i mean , each individual was not specialized and did not have a specific job , it would be a disaster !!!for instance , research would not have had so many discoveries in all this years .moreover , doctors must be specialized to take care of their pacients in the correct way !!!the second reason is because not specializing in something does not allow you to pursue a real carreer .for instance , the fact that genius did so much for us is a concequence of having specialized the subject that fit better to them .moreover , it does not solve our problems being all aware of general information .we need experts to progress in all subjects .furthermore , having a gift for a subject helps you to trust yourself and to be proud of yourself when you succeeds in this discipline .you feel special and it helps you also in your private life .in addition , specializing in one specific subject helps you to focus in something that you like making you happy !!why should i study maths if i do not want to ?why should i do that ?if somebody is not capable to study a subject because he really does not understand that why shoud he be obliged to do that ?to sum up , i am convinced that individuals must be free to do what they like and there is no reason to dny this right .
