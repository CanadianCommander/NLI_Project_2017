i agree with this statement .twenty years ago , when my father was young his family had only a small income so he startet working in the age of 14 .so he had no time to help the communitiy .today , life is much easier for children and young adults .i am the best example - i am 22 years old and i only work in the summer break .i am studying to get a better job and to earn more money than my father earned when he was young .an other reason why i waste a lot of time at university is because i want to get a job that is not bad for my wealthy .that means i have more time and i am not as tired as for example my father was when he came home .but on the other hand today young people have a lot of hobbies .they like to go swimming in the summer and they are happy if they can play in snow in winter .they can enjoy to be child .later they spend a lot of time in pubs with theire friends .they have also to go to school or university and to learn for tests .if i ask myself why i do not give time to help my communities , i do not get a real reason .i think our generation is a bit selfish - everyone only cares about his own problems and needs .to increase this situation it could be effective to talk about in school .teachers could find out the reasons and they could try to change it together .i hope my childrens will give enough time to helping their communities , because it is really necessary for the communities .
