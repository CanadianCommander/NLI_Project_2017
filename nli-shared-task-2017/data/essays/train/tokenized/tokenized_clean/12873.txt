in my opinion , according to the statistics in the past decade imigration to the big cities from suburban areas is rapidly growing .i think that cars become more popular relaed with this city lifestyle .meanwhile number of big metropolitians are increasing year by year .i would like to draw an attention the reasons of imigration such as huge potential of unemployment , not enough support for agriculture and farmers , a huge gap between urban and suburban areas education system across the country .so in big cities personel cars become a requirement for those people .as i mentioned before living in a big city forces you to have a car to do everything you want in this lifestyle .besides it also accounts for traffic jam and big mass caos in cities that makes people unable to live in .on the other hand there are different kind of public transportations .in developed countries we can perceive widespread usage of public transportations .but if we look at the developing countries personel car usage is hiher rates becuase of insufficent public transport systems .for example , istanbul is the biggest city of turkey ; since last year i can not drive to work because there is always an enormous traffic on highways do you think it would probably changed ?no i do not think so .whereas technological developments also provides a appropriate platform for people to attract and make them to buy a new car .to sum up , in our rapidly changing and developing world to live witout a car would a utopia .the more money you earn , the more luxury you need .
