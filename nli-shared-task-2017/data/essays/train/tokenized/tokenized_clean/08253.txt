the world we are living in is a globalized and competitive one , as economies have come closer to each other , producers and consumers are growingly becoming part of one single global market .goods and services can now be offered through out the world with very little barriers and similar technologies available to almost every producer .therefore , products are becoming increasingly difficult to be differentiated .in order to differentiate , produces look for the objetive and subjective qualities that can make the product unique or distinctive , and then they must communicate these qualities to its potential consumers , mainly through advertisement .so every day we face endless promises of how good and special a product can be , some times appealing to the objective qualities or the subjective qualities , or perhaps a combination of both .i consider this is to be fair right that producers have in order to succeed in this competitive market .the statement that false promises are made by produces is rather unfair , since mostly it refers to the subjective qualities of the product .in the end , it will always be the customers choice to purchase the product based on his or her personal preferences .lets consider the example of a car advertisement where they first explain the specifications of the engine and technical features .this is are mostly objetive qualities , and the producer has the responsibility of being truthful , actually , false claims are not only illegal but also harmful to the manufacurer long term success .on the other hand , when they explain the subjective elements that will make you buy the car , they are appealing to your personal taste , which will be the judge of how good or not the car is , leaving no room for seeming to be what it is not .in conclusion , i must disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are , since it is founded on the premise that the advertiser could be liable for differences in judgements on subjetive matters .
