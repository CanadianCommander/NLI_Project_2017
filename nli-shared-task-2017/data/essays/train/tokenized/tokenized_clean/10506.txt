i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .one reason is that it motivate other poeples creating new product .for example , if sucessful invent new products and it earn much money , it would be motivated other people to invent more useful thing than fomer thing which made by successful people made .so it make consumers use more useful things .second reason is that it is very holic in my case when i took a math problems or other problems but i solved myself it s so exciting that i want to feel it again .i think it is same about try new things and take risks .i know how excited it is about inventing or producing new things which noone invent or produce it .also it bring not only much money but also respects other peoples .finally , if they no more try new thing it makes me lazy .i saw many times that if someone who invent new thing but no more try , finally he disrupted and divorced .
