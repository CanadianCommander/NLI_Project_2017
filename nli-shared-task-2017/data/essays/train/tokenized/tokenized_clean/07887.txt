in my opinion , i think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concept , because the student do nt forget them .for example , i study civil engineer and for preparation my examinations , i understand more concept , scientific teory have many concepts that elaborated many ideas , instead if i learn facts , i must hope that i do nt forget them .when i have starting the university i have find a very good professor that i teach my like understand fully ideas and concept , as to do summarize fact in few ideas and concept , for have complessive panoramics of the problem .on first time , i worked hard to improve this method , but i have satisfactions while i was studing and during examination .my memory is not very hard to memorize each ideas and cocept so i write each thing .writing help me to recognize and understand ideas and concept , another way of understand ideas and concept is that recording lessons , conversation and other that is important for my everydays s life .however is more important understand what there is beyond things , therefore ideas and concepts .for example when somebody projectd an object , he uses ideas and cocepts of theories that him understand .for other students that study in umanistic university , i think that it is more important for them learn facts .infact when they go to examinations , they must talk about specific facts , like for example stories as civil war , and so they studied specific fact and not only understand ideas and concept .
