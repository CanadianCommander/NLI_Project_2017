the advertisement announces are invading the space of city , the radio , the tv etc .fot this reasons some people ca nt stand them , furthermore other people consider them as a type of `` art  .those are simply personal opinions , but , the real problem is when the advertisements do nt say the truth .it s a great problem like all lies .some people think that is nt a problem and thay say that the person has a skill to decide a product indipendently on basis the only functionals of the product .but i disegree this opinion because often the advertisement do nt speak about the only functionals of the product but it promises other characteristics that do nt depend by it .in conclusion the advertisements must be controlled and they must speak about the product only with its real characteristics .
