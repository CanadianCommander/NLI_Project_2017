i do not think there will be fewer cars than today in twenty years , although i think it would be a positive thing for the environment .there are many ways to discourage people to use their cars , but these ways are not very often put into practice .some countries , like the scandinavian countries , have been very successful in reducing the use of cars .the methods they used are well-known : tax incentives , available and cheap public transportation , ban on cars in city centers , education and sensibilisation to environmental issues . ..by reducing significantly the use of cars , the standard of living is also enhanced : less pollution , less noise , less trafic jams , less stress . ..all of these are positive consequences of an environment-friendly policy .unfortunately , many countries are not following denmark , sweden or norway s examples .the united-states for instance are the biggest car-users in the world .one reason is that it is a very large country , with huge distances to cover .another reason is that oil is cheap .moreover , the public transportation service is disastrous .conveniency is also a reason for the intempestive use of cars : it is easier to take your car than to do a five-minute walk or to catch a bus .there might also be a cultural element in the american taste for cars .given the governmentspolicy concerning cars , i doubt the use will significantly diminish in twenty years  time .an alternative method to escape car pollution might be the search for non polluting devices that would allow to use environment-friendly cars .hybrid cars , using partly oil and partly electricity or non-polluting oils , already exist .but theres is also an economical aspect to the question .huge economical interests are at stake .the oil market deals with enormous amounts of money , and big oil corporations do not want to see their profits decline .they try to discourage the search for new technologies to replace oil .but , as the stock of oil will diminish more and more , those technologies will have to be developped anyway .but , first of all , the international community will have to become aware of this problem .to conclude , i would like to say that there will probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years .but , hopefully , these cars will be environment-friendly cars .
