yes i m totally agreed with the above statement .understanding ideas and developing your way of thinking about the facs and analyzing the problem in various ways is the key factor in the sucess of any student while his scholar carrier .it is the fundamentals only which provides a stronger base to any concept or any derivation of idea , so very first initiative in the student s mnd should be bary clear about his fundamentals .after understanding the base one shoul be able to clarify the concepts hiding behind any proble or solution .the concept is the thing which often many students escapes due to their laziness or their fear for understanding the concepts , because generally it takes time to build your concepts .students often prefer to learn the facts ang swell then to save time and workship but they dont ever thinks of its after effects in their coming future life , because whenever they wil be using their theoretical knowledge on the practical groung definitely they will be in trouble to summarize their ideas and providing a good soultion to any practical problem .it is really speaking a art for any learner who is really keen to grasp and going in depth of any concept and proving the thing very clearly .a student always should be willing to learn something innovative .and this is possible only when he lear about the concepts and ideas and building their own analyis and tactics .for any student there shold not be any ken , because he is in a state of learning nothing can be fixed for them to learn only this .it shows the salubrious nature of any student who is confident about the concepts and ideas .there are gigantic many sources available for building the concepts and upgrading the ideas .student s sagacious behaviour makes him a well analyzer and its the only thing which hones ones skills and knowledge .often some students get intimidate by hearing the questions like ` what concepts you made form this idea ?this should not be any more difficulty for the students to sharp their skills and learning ability in their age because its the fundation of any buliding which they are going to build based on those concepts .if the foundation will not be strong then definitely it is going to collapse .the ultimately we are in state of realizing the imporatnce of concept buliding and developing your skills .only by leaning facts and swelling them one can provide an immediate solution to the problem but definitely all his efforts will be in vain if is not well equipped with the concept building .when students goes to a practical field of life and they are called for expressing their ideas about anything they studied then at time they will be producing an ineffective demonstartion of their skills .so if we think in long term then we find that the conceptualising things will be fruitfull and also will provide you self satisfaction .finally ild like to conclude with the statement  pracice makes a man perfect  and practice is notinh but honing your concepts and abilities .
