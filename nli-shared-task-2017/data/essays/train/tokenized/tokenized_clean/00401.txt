i agree with this statement .i think that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experience .also , it is useful on the several situation .first of all , i think that people who have the knowledge about anything are respected by other people .if the teacher know about not only english but also scientics , when he or she is asked by his or her students , he or she can answer smoothly .and , they can solve their question .in my case , my english teacher has knowledge anout anything .for example , he knows about the art , the history of the livings , and the lifes of the other countries  tribes .when i talked with him about these subjects , i was surprised and thought that i could learn various things from him as my teacher .i can ask the question what i ca nt solve , and everytime , he responds my question .therefore , i respect of him because he is intelligent .in addition , if people know that , they can use their knowledge anytime .for example , when they are forced to write the essay about the subjects that i mentioned before , they can write them without researching .they do nt have to waste of time to investigate or ask to the others .moreover , even if they research about them , they know the basic things , so they can improve their knpwledge from other information .in my experience , when i had to research to write the essay about the problem about yasukuni shrine because i had no idea about that .at that time , i regretted that i did nt have the knowledge .if i knew about the problem , i could write the essay more deeply or effectively .in summary , i think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledge about various subjects .one reason is they can be praised their intelligence when theycan answer the question from other people .the other thing is that it is useful on their lives .
