it is true : youngsters do not care much about their communities or at least a fewer part of them do it with respect to elder generations .our society is now living a period of general wealth meaning that there are less problmatic issues than past years and that living style has been improved by new technologies to make us always more and more comfortable .if we look back at the 1960s , the situation was more complicated : in those days , people were demonstrating in the streets to gather certain rights such as the right to divorce in italy and the workers  class claimed more facilities to improve their life conditions .many strikes followed and it is worth noting that students took part too .this is why they were more concerned about community : they felt the need to manifest their opinions in order to achieve a better life style , the need to fight , without using phisycal violence , for their scopes , strongly believing there was something to change .this is my generational problem : we do not have something to complain about , we are well off .we do not feel the importance of manifesting a particular belief or claiming the fact the society still has something wrong simply because we are not able to see these problems .of course not all behave selfishly against the community : there are some young members working in associations aiming at community welfare .these youngsters are most likely those who live close to community problems not only at work but during their daily life because they are the first to be aware of the situation and still the first that have to react .from these harsh experiences awarness arises , followed by the aim to change in better the sorrounding enviroment as well as it happened during the 1960s .there is another set of persons likely to help the community : wealthy people understanding that the huge difference among them and poors can not be totally flattened but they can give their help as well , exploiting their advantageous positions .
