i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .for example , when albert einstine discovered new things , he did nt know any of those things .he was nt familiar with his discoveries and did nt know them well .but he took a risk and tried new things which lead to his great discoveries .if he did nt take risks and just kept doing what he was already familiar with , he would have never found out all those famous discoveries that he did .because he took risks and tried new things , he discovered new important things which made him successful .another example is the lewis and clark expedition .before they went on their trip , no one knew what was waiting for them in the west .but lewis and clark took a huge risk , leading a group of peoples into the west , hoping that there would be a great discovery there .if they just stayed in areas they were familiar with , they would have never found the great west .because lewis and clark tried something new , they were able to find the west which made them very successful people .my last example has something to do with something that can relate to everyday people .my little sister was working on a science project last week .after she had done all the required things , she took a look at her project .she was worried that she would nt get a good grade on it .so she called me over and asked what she could do to make her project better .i told her that she should do something creative that other students would nt do .something creative would make her project stand out and catch people s attention .so my little sister took my advice and did something that was nt even on the rubric for the project .by doing this , she was taking a huge risk of losing points on her project .but because she took this risk , the teacher told her that her project was the most creative project and got extra points .by taking the risk and trying something new , my little sister was able to earn extra points which made her grade over 100 % and also a very successful student .in all these examples , they would have never been successful if they did nt take the risk and try new things .but becasue they tried new things and took the risk , they were successful .
