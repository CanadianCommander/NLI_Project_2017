actually , why do children go to school ?this question should help us decide whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .i would personnally say that sudents need first to understand , then to learn .i would nt say that one is more important vthen the other , i would more likely try to convince people that one has to come before the other .order usually doesn-t seem so important , but in my opinion in this case it is .i-d say it is a matter of democracy applied to school : as people need first to be able to choose , the only way to put them in the right conditions to do so is to teach them how to think how can children be thaught how to think ?their curiosity must be called , they need to be interested in the subject they-re studing .if the teacher succeeds in that , the children will ask questions as a result of a personal thought .a response to that question will make them understand the concept and remember at the time .and putting understanding and remembering toghether the teacher leads to . ..learning .that-s why understanding has to come before simple learning .let-s assume , for example , that a student is thaught that in 1789 french revolution took place .he will know the fact , but will he be able to explain how french population has arrived to that situation ?and most of all , will he remember this fact and this date for more than the lesson time ?i don-t think so .i pretty sure he will forget as soon as he will exit the classroom or , in the best of the cases , after the examination , precisely because the fact has come alone without a personal and maybe emotional participation to the moment of learning .understanding provides this essentially needed personal participation .people are not computers , the only way to give them a real effective culture is to make them think and understand , although we could say that cu ; lture is made by the knowledge of facts .
