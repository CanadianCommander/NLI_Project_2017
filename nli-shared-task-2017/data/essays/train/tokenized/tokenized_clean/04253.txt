i agree with this statemet because , generally , and even if certain old persons largely enjoy their lives , young people are more likely to enjoy their lives for many reasons .first of all , older persons often have disabilities or illnesses .when they begin to grow older , people s bodies begin to be less and less effective , they may loose some reflexes or their mind for example .they may also have heart diseases and be afraid to do some things .usually , they do less and less things .however , young people will have a more effective body , they are at their optimal age and are most of the time able to do sportive activities , to dance , to go to bed later . ..they are able to do some things that older people can not do .most young people also enjoy life more than older persons because they think they still have a long life to live , and they prefer living their lives as best as they can and doing the craziest things while they are young and still able to do them , and also crazy enough to do them .when people grow older , they know their lives may be ending soon , and they often think that they have lived enough things in their lives to die peacefully and happily .moreover , people often do less crazy things when they grow older because they often have more responsabilities .they may have a family , children or grandchildren that younger people do not have , and they do not want their families to loose them , so they live a quieter and a more peaceful life , and thus sometimes enjoy less their lives than younger people .but i also think that some people may enjoy a quiet life , but some people may like to do crazy things , even at an old age .i think that some people who like to live a quiet life may still enjoy their lives when they are older while those who like to live a less quieter life but who are obliged to do so because of diseases or illnesses must not enjoy their lives very much .some young people may also not enjoy their lives .in a conclusion , i think that young people often enjoy more their lives than older people , but i aalso think that old and young people can both enjoy or not enjoy their lives .i think it is a question of character and personality .
