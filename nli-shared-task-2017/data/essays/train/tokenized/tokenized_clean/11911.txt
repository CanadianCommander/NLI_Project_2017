this question is making me to think .young people are giving enough time to helping their communities .i belive they dont .i can explained my view with many points .some of them are as below .young people in todays world are busy in themselves .they start working at early age .most of them study and work as a part time .they are mainly focused on study and work .they don t have time to thing about their community .they dont consider it is important for them to help their community .they don t care about others .they are clueless about their life and their duties towards their communities .for e g if you ask any young person what he wants to do to the community .he will replay that they don t have time for that .basically they are busy with something which is not valuable .they are busy with their own interests .some of them enjoy going out , traveling every week ends , goining out to parties and spend their weekends doing nothing but enjoyment .then they want toclaim that they don t have time .it is very difficult task to make them understant that they owe some responsibilities towards the community they belong to .having not enough time is not the real reason for that .basically they don t have helping attitude in them .we should help them to realize that they can get time if they want .if there is will they can .according to my opinion it s parents duty to make them understand their duties towards their community .they should take out somr tiome from their schedule and use that time to help their communities .it is their duty and they should do it without any reason .they are living here .
