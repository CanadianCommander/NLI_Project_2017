i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are three reasons .first , older people have much time than young people because after older people retired thier jobs , they can enjoy the second life slowly .when they were working , they were so busy that they could not do what they want to .besides , they could not take many vacations .they can do things which they could not do when they were working because they have a lot of time .however , young people do nt have a lot of time .they have to go to school or work .students have exams .they are recqired to study harder and harder for exams .second , they have more money than young people .when they were working , they would save money for their future .they can buy what they want , go where they want to and eat what they want to .finally , of course older people have experienced a lot of things .they know what they should do when a problem happens .they also know how to avoid a problem .they would experience hard things that as if it seemed that they could not solve the problem , but young people have not experienced such a thing yet .even if young people have experienced such a thing , the number would much less than those of older people .
