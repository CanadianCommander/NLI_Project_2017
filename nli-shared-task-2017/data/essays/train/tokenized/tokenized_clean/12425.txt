some students put a higher value in understanding the ideas and their concepts , rather than understanding the facts .the fact that i graduated with a major in international business , has exposed me to different elements , all taken in account when questioning myself , which of the both statements i agree with .however , both can have equal advantages that are quite different in many aspects .as far as i am concerned , understanding a subject s ideas and concepts is more critical than studying the facts .for instance , the overall idea will stay in a student s mind for a much longer period , sometimes even for ever .furthermore , these ideas and concepts can be re-used in the future in various situations .for instance , those i had learned in my business class helped me to open my own company a few years later .however , putting higher importance in studying the subject s ideas and concepts only , can have equal disadvantageous elements .understanding the facts can be dramatically important , depending on the chosen subject and career field especially .for instance , a history student is likely to study the facts and dates of a historical event because its required .if the facts are used on a regular basis , the student might be able to remember some of them for an eternal period of time .in conclusion , learning about a theme s ideas and concepts was very beneficial for me with regards to my major .however , each student should be able to make an own decision , when questioning himself what is more essential for his studies .furthermore the student s chosen career plays an important role , when answering this question .
