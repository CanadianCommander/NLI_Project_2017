i agree to the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today for three reasons .thinking of the polluted air and the growing width of the ozone halles , the number of cars must be reduced whether we like it or not for the survival of the global citizens .first of all , we have to improve the condition of the polluted air .in developing countries , such as china and korea , they have a growing number of automobiles , which causes even worse air pollution .also developed countries , such as the united states , have as great numbers of cars as before , as they are used to the convenient way of life with automobils .however , we have to have clean air to survive on the earth .if we continue to live in this polluted air , much more people would die because of polluted air .we have to do something for the betterment of human beings .secondly , there will be less amount of petral available to keep the cars running .oil is not sustainable resource and it will be used up if we keep using it .to obtain enough amount of oil , there will be more cases of international conflicts and wars .therefore we have to think of alternative ways of transportation , such as public transportation , car sharing , and even walking to work .thirdly , the number of people who can buy a car will decrease because of widening of the gap between the rich and the poor .these days , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and unfortunately , the number of the poor outnumber the rich in many cases .this is why i have to agree that we must reduce the number of cars in twenty years , although i now indulge the luxury of driving to work .i really have to think of what i can do to improve this environmental issue of the world .
