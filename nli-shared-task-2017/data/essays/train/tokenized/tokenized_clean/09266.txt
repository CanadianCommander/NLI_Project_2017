i think to understand ideas and concepts are more important than memorize facts .why ?first of all the concepts and ideas represent the core of any mechanism or process or any theory .in philosophy for example if we do not undrestand the idea or the concepts behind how socrat use to think , we will miss all his theories and his propency in thinking .gathering facts on socrats will be useless .the second reason is that facts are kind of details supporting concepts and ideas .to memorize them is good but if we do not it does nt matter exept for the most significants .more over facts can be found in any type of memory extantion as data bases , enceclopdia , books .some of them are suffisiant to be be listed as examples to support the idea or the concept .in a lecture teachers are focusing on ideas and concepts because they now they are important and they spend more time explain them to make sure that student understand them .how ever they may let student work by them selves on gatherins facts , because they are easy to find .the other reson why concepts and ideas are more important to focus on is the huge amount of information availble on different subjects in labrariea and throught the internet .the student have to learn how to focus on the most important information and get red of the less important in other word , students have to know how to classify their knowlege or how to prioritize their knowlege .the complexity of new subjects like technology or like human sciences does not allow to be losted in facts , i mean in details students has to understand first and make the complexity mastred before going and memorizing .in conclusion would say that understinding cocepts and ideas is the most important part when learning on a subject , facts can flow and c
