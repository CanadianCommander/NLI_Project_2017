many people believe that old people enjoy their life more than young people ; however , i believe that young people also enjoy thier life more than old people becuase young people have a lot of curious of life , besids they are more energetic than old people .it is true that old people enjoy thier life more than young people becuase they already reitre from thier work ; in other worlds , they already support their childrean : as a result , they troubleing all the time with their money that they save when they were young .however , young people also enjoy themselves .young people do not know much about the reall life ; in other worlds , they have a lot of curious that make them happy .for example , when i was teenager , i had alot of curious of love .i wanted know what love is .one day i met a one man whose named jack .jack also had a lot of curious of love .we did not know about the love ; therefore , we learnd together .we cried and laght together .we learend how love make people to live in this socities .we had a fun and enjoy .not only that we also learn how to get a baby .finally we married and having a three babied .which means my curious made me my real life .having fun and enjoy is very difficult .in other worlds , if person who do not have a powere of enjoy their life , it would be very un happy to live .for example , once upon a time , i had a lot of friends .we always hit the pot .we had a lot fun at the moment .however if person who is not strong , it would be hard to enjoy that time .for example , my grand mother and grand father had a lot of beautifull life when they were young becuase they never retired from the parties becuase of stranth ; however , they could not go to the parties today becuase they are too old to dance .both are true that young people and old people can enjoy themselve ; however , it is easyto enjoy their life when they are young becuase they are strong than old people and everthing is interesting to them .
