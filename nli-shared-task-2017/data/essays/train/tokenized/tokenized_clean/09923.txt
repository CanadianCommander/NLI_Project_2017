the education is more and more important to everyone in the world now , but different people have different pointviews on what is more important for the students .some people think that understand the ideas is more important , but there is also a group of people thinks that it shou nt be like that , learn facts is more important than understanding ideas .i , however , believe that we should pay more attention on learn facts than understand ideas .because the reasons below .the first reason , the most important one , the ideas are coming from the facts and the facts is helping us to understand the idea better .here is an example , when we take the physics classes , we always do a lot of labs , for what ?to get the facts , then by these facts , we get the ideas by ourselves , then because we got the ideas by ourself , we understand these ideas much deeper than just learned from the teacher .and also , the facts is helping us to understand the ideas much quicker .as an example , if you want to learn swimming , do you think is it going to be learnning it quickier by just get the idea ?or you go inside the water , then you learned how to swim ?of course should be the second way .then the second reason , ideas sometimes get wrong , but how do you know ?without the facts , you never know .like in the past time , there is a idea about if two objects dropped from the same height , then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first .but then a scientist do nt think so , so he did a lab , he went on a tower and dropped two object with different masses at same height , but these two objests hit the group at the same time , so that means the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong .so we see , without the exam by the facts , you never know the idea is right or not .well , from the reasons above , we can say that , learning facts is important than understand ideas , no facts , no ideas , even we got the idea without the facts , you might get the wrong idea .so i agree with the idea that pay more attention on learn facts .
