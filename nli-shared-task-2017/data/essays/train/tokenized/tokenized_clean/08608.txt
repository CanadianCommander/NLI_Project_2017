i do believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .as the care are going cheaper and cheaper , many families bought the car .this directly caused the shortage of parking space .our goverment published a new rule that increase the charge of parking .also , the goverment also raise the fee for the annual exam of the cars .people are getting more and more care about their money rather than their convinience .my father is exactly an example .we drove our car anywhere we were goin to , though it was only 2 km away from my home .but now , everything changed .when he plans to drive the car , he will count whether it is worthwhile .of course , this is a effective way to reduce the use of cars .now it is , and it will .secondly , people are going to concern the enviroment .as so many disasters happened in recent year , we do realized that cars do make a big contribution to the worldwide pollution .more and more polluted gases are out , and we can not live healthily .it may caused diseases such as caugh , headache and so on .we can easily hear the people around us say that take care of the dust outside , it will make you sick .not using cares means we are taking care not only the enviroument but also we ourselves .thirdly , the goverment and scientis are also devoted to set up a convient public traffic system .my father picked me up from school every day .though i could straightly get to the gate of my house that subway or bus can not , i had to suffer the traffic jam everyday and stay in the car just listening to the `` beep  .that s convinient , but absolutly not comfortable !also , the control of the population in many countries is also an important reason that support my opinion .the less people , the fewer cars .this is certainly right .all in all , we know what is the best for us .reducing the use of car make our lifes more comfortable .so i believe that the number of the car will surely reduce in twenty years .
