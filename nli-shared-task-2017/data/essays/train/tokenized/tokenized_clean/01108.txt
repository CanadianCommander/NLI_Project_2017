i have sadly to disagree with the statement , althought this prospective would be a good thing for the earth s wealfare .confronting the nowadays situation of cars with tha increasingly growth of the world population , the prevision , also for such a far future is not good .every family , today , have at least two cars and every year there is a new request of new models that could be adapted to the incoming different aspects of life .the main fuel we use is the oil and although it is not a renewable source , and scientists said that in about forty years it will ended , we are already experimenting new ways to make our cars running as well .the pollution producted by cars circulation , because of the `` black gold  are one of the main causes of hole in the ozon .however , we have more echological consciousness now and , a lot of new cars prototypes are made to respect the nature where the human being lives .we are addicted to the use of cars and others locomotions vehicles , and i thing we are not going to renounce to them .the car is also a staus symbol of wellness , and that is another reason why growing population such as china or asian populations in general , are going to buy cars for the next 20 years
