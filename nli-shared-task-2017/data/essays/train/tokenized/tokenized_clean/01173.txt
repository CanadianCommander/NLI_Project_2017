i definetely agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .it is not exaggeration that we now live in cars society .cars made a revolution of transformation method , they established the position as the most convenient transportation method .besides , car market is also one of the biggest commercial markets , and cars are essential to our economy .considering the statement , however , we need to pay attention to the disadvantags of them .using cars cause the enrvironmental problem ; for example , an air pollution and the earth warming .as the gas which are excluded from each car contaminates the air especially in the city , people are suffering from the uncleared air .to make matters worse , it is reported that it can cause the earth warming , which is the biggest environmental problem not only for the people of city dwellers but also the people in the world .moreover , in terms of the natural resorces , cars requires a lot of gasoline to mobilize them .gasoline are made by refining the petrogen , which is said to run out in 25 years in the earth .from the point of the human society , using cars generates a number of traffic accidents due to the careless mistakes or the drive by the drunker .traffic accidents are the social problem in my country , japan , and more than 10000 people are killed every year .considering the other transportation method , such as the plane , the train , the bus , there are more advantages than cars have .these public transportation system can carry much more people , and save the fuel and natural resorces .accordingly , they do nt pollute the environment as much as the cars .in terms of safety , they can lose the possibilities of facing the accidents by using these system .the rate of encounting accidents of public system are much lower than the cars .if you can dring a lot or get tired , you can go home by using them .as i mentioned above , there are more good points in using public transportation system .of course , cars provides us the enlightment of driving and some people are fascinated with the speed .but now we need to take care of the disadvantages in terms of the envirnment and safety .i believe people will soon give up using cars , and use public system in stead .
