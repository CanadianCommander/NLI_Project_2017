i like to travel on my own schedule and leisure .so i disagree that the best way to travel is by being in a group led by a tour guide .for me travel signifies unwinding myself , discovering unknown things and waking up and sleeping when i want to .by giving the tour guide control of this time and lettting him/her run my schedule would be sure shot recipe for ruining my holiday .from my childhood days i have memories of certain trips i took with my parents where they signed up for group trips with a guide as part of the package i remember being tired and bored at the end of the day .all the places we went to were predictable and crowded .but when there were day trips we made to the beaches around and just lazed and played in the sand it brought me joy and the pictures always were a delight to watch .one exception to this is when we visited a world famous sun temple in india which dates back to several hundred years my father hired a tour guide and he explained to us the meaning of different sculptures and their significance in history since this temple was located in one of the oldest kingdoms in india .now that my husband and i go on holidays together we do not follow any schedule .the last time we went on a vacation unplanned we discovered a safari that was not listed in any of the local attractions .we ended up staying in bamboo huts right on a strip of a private beach with its own kitchen .the adventurer in me will not let me follow any set pattern of visiting famous attractions based on someone else s prediction of what needs to be seen .of course , if i visit france i will go see the eiffel tower or any world famous attraction in that city but i may just sit on the side and observe people as i will grow older and perhaps have more time to travel , i know the wanderlust will not fade away and i would like to travel and explore the world .i also know that while travelling i will come across diverse cultures and people and their foods and habits .i want to use my travelling experiences to know how and why people live the way they do and while i do that i hope it will help me and my family understand the world in a better way .that is the legacy i want to teach my daughter - of tolerance and understanding for people who dont necessarily eat or look like us .a group travel with a tour guide will definitely not help me achieve this .i would think it will fulfill my role as a part of this world instead of just coming home from a far away place with a momento and a memory of a luxurious hotel .
