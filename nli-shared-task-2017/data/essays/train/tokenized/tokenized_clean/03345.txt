everyone in his life looks for a prosperous future and likes to get a job where he can apply his academic study and experiemtal skills .and to find this job he must be very good in his major .but the student must not concentrate only on the subjects that are important for his major .so , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speialize in one specific subject .my friend studied engineering in the university , he is very good in his major and he knows every thing about it .he graduated from the university with very high grades .now he is working in a big company .but the big problem with this friend is that he is unsociable .the reason for this loneliness is that he know nothing except his major .he can not talk about other subjects like litereture , politics , or music .so , inorder for the student to be more sociable and to take more experiencies in life , he must have knowlege about any field .the student in the university must take courses in the university that are not related to his major .for example , if the student s major is physics , he should take musical courses or philosiphical course in order to make his knowledge not restricted only in physics .so , he can make conversations with his friends about music and art .and if he set in a society and talks with older people who have more experiences in life than him , he will look very intellectual .he benifets from that by having more friends and by making relations with big number of peoples .many people think that the student must focus in one subject that will reflect his future and his career , but i think it is better for a student to have knowledge about a variety of topics .throughout my education i took many courses like music and arts andi find it benefit .
