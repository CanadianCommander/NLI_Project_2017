i would like to believe this statement will come true , but i think it will be very difficult .first of all , the degree of cars increasing does not seem to stop and mainly in that countries that are growing up economically in this period like china , india and brasil .so i believe it will be impossible stop this raising for the next years .another point is that the nowadays culture is not ready for changing its habits .the most cities in the world are plenty of cars because the governements do not support alternative transports , like for examples public transport .i think if the trams , subways , trains , ect .would be more efficient than now , people would choose to catch the underground instead picking up the car and staying stopped in the traffic jam .for instance , the problem in my city is that the only ways to move are the car or the tram .besides , this public transport is not modern at all , very dirty and in add you can not rely on it .so it is obvious that people prefer driving their car .i know that some new cities for example in china are developped with a powerfull net of public transport to encourage to not take the car , but we need to consider that in the most old cities is very difficult improve new forms of transport because it is not so easy to integrate them with the environment .according to this opinion , rome does not have the subway because digging they found out anchient pieces that are considered very valuable so they can not go on .sometimes in other cities subway or trains are very expensive and so this do not encourage anybody to move by public transports .of course , later on , things have to change .one of the most actual troubles in this period is pollution because of the cars smog .so it will be a must trying to decrease the numbers of cars and finding alternative transport ways .
