i agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do .our current society gives more opportunities to young people than old people .thus , young people have more oportunities that they can find things that they can enjoy .first , young people do more activities than older people .young people who living in society , they have to do a lot of things .some people have to do work and some people have to s tudy for their future .also these are decided by their own opinion .young people can decide what they want to be and what they want to do .they can find happiness while they are doing something .i always thinking that i want to be a jouenalist .that is why i would like to researching people and reading a book .i really enjoy things that i do and i am happy to study that i want to do .aometimes i saw people who does not have to learn any more like my grandmother .my grand mother graduated from korea-university and right after graduation she went to china for learn cinese .however , she does not study anymore and just stay at home .one day , when i visit her , she asked me that what i want to be and i told her i want to be a journalist .i remember she told me that do it hard wharever i do because she thought when she learn somthing that she want to was her happiest time of the life .second , also , young people have more opportunities that they can get involve the group .in our society , people need to live with other people .if people live alone they can never be happy and never enjoy their lives .i think young people have more opportunities that they can meet more people than older people .almost young people are belonging many kinds on groups , suchas class mates , church people , also whatever they do for their habits .old people might belonging groups but according to research from the korean-broadcast that i remember said compare to young people group and old people group of book club , young people group have more activities like trip , meeting and discussion .these are the reason of why i agree with the sentence `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .because young people have more opportunities than old people , they can enjoy their life more than old people .
