i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .when i watching the tv commercial or magerzine , i was suprised because the comercials and real materials are too different .and sometimes , i see the wrong information that says they have more effect likes bubble , i think that adverisements make products seem much better than they really are because when they did that they can get more economic profit and they think that they make good products so they have a good image .first , when they make produscts seem much better than they really are , most people believe that and they buy and use the products so they can get more money and more economic profits .for example , yesterday i bought some chips .i do not konw exaxtly kinds of chips and favior of chips .i choose one that i saw the advertise on the tv because when i was watching tv , it looks delicious .but it is not a delicious .i think that customers buy products that was watched or heared .second , they think they make good products and good image .but it is not true .they make usual products .the comercial is just showed that looks much better , and some advertise are appear famouse star or people so people buy the products .but it is just comercial .so do not allow the tric .in conclusion , when the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , owner can get more money and economic profits , and they think that they have a good emage and they make a good products .but i think that it is tric .it is just bubble so if i am a advertiser , i want to do that do not seem much better and i show the real products  tempt .
