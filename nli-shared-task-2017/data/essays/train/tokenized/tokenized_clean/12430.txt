it s equally important for a student to undertand ideas or concepts and facts .when students are begining with their education , they just learn facts .for example : that 2 x 3 is 6 or that balloons can float in the air .however , to achive a better comprehension of that fact , they need to know all the ideas and concepts that are behind it .they have to learn the idea about , fo example multiplications , to be more efficient doing them and to applicate them in other problems .about the example of the balloon , when the students , finally know that the principle about densities is the responsible that the balloon to float in the air , they will understand better the phenomenon and similar facts too .we , the people , create ideas and concepts to explain better all the facts that surrounds us .a theory or state is assigned when we see a fact .for example , galileo formulated the theory about the gravity when he saw that an apple dropped down from a tree and hit his head .an idea or concept that do nt explain something that we can see in our surrounding is near useless .for what does we can use a theory that does nt explain any observable and measurable besides nothing ?but , in the other hand , some ideas have helped us to see facts that we did nt saw before .for example , the ideas and concepts of the early periodic table of chemistry , suggested the presence of new elements .this was confirmed with the discover of oxygen , which was nt discovered till several studies of the combustion .it s imperative to remember that the students will understand the ideas and concepts when they have the necessary knowledge and the mental abilities .it s really difficult trying to teach a kid of 5 years the ideas and concepts that students graduate schools see .they will understand the ideas when they reach the indicated age .finally , not the facts nor the ideas are the most important things that the students have to learn .to achieve a complete education , they need to learn facts and to understand ideas in the same amount .
