there are so many advertisement in the tv , newspaters , and magazines .the purpose of the advertisement is the increse of the sales .maybe it works very well , for the advertisements still exist even though the cost of advertisement is so expensive .i agree with the statement that the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .i can easily find the example that the advertisement works well .my mother has good conditioned refrigerator .there are no problem to preserve the food or to freeze the ice , but after she watched repeatedly the advertisement which explains the new and good funciton of the refrigerator during the tv drama , she considers whether to change the refrigerator to new model or not .i think the real funciton of the new refrigerators is not different from the old one we have .however , advertisement makes her think the new refrigerator have better function and buy it .second , advertisment also provide people the illusion by showing that the famouse people use the product .famouse person like actors and sports star use the product and persuade the people to use the product in the advertisement .this type of advertisement make the image that the product is good because famous person use the product .the advertisement misleads someone to buy the prodcut even though the quality of the product is not good .in conclusion , the advertisments make people to buy product more if the advertisement does not exist .the advertisement give the information of the product , but because the purpose of the advertisement is not only giving the information but also persuading the people to buy the product , thd advertisements definitely exaggerate the quality of the product and makes the some image that differ from the real product .
