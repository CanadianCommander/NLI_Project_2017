i do agree with the point that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .at this point of time i would like to cite a very famous song  we will rock you  that proves to me that youth is full of energy , zeal , mischiefs and livlihood .these all makes a young person excited and make him ready to take on the world .when a girl or boy reaches a stage to be called young then his / her parents start giving freedom to them which they welcome and like most .when they do not work or get married they depend on their parents and study for their aim .this makes them full of enthusiasm which old people lacks as they had already been to a stage where they can not think of making their career and becomes dispirited .in young days one has lot many friends to play with , to roam , watching movies and sharing their views which most of the time a person in old age miss .parties , sports , gossips , food and excursions are all part of the life in young days .with old age people start loosing their body strength and they get overloaded with resposibilities which youngs never care in their time .an earning old person have to think about his family before taking dicisions .he has to abide of the state laws of tax and has to pay attentions to their youngs for their future .they need to laid the foundations for the life of their childrens .young people work for the things they want and when they achieve they find themselves much more happy than anyone else .when they reached in their professional life they start earning and with the money they purchase the things which they thought of in childhood .so young people have an advantage to enjoy life more than anyone else and the reason lies behind the freedom and very few resposibilities .but as these resposibilities their actions gets affected with them and their freedom starts decreasing .with age they become resposible and seroius with very less enjoyment in life .
