traveling from one place to another is a good experiemce for everyone s life .i think traveling by your own or with a group of people you know is more fun because , firstly , you will have the chance to go wherever you want .second , it will teach you how to discover new places .thirdly , it a good way to learn how to read maps and to be dependent .i completely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .to go wherever you would like is better than to be stucked with a group of people who are following a touring guide .for example , in every country there are some places which are nicer than the othersm .the tourist guide choose some of them to visit and leave the others that he or she feels are not interested to visit .however , the places which are left might be nicer in other people s opinion .so being traveling alone will guarantee a good chance for you to visit what you would like .being afraid to be lost is the main reason for those who choose to travel with a tour guide .in my openion it is more enjoyable to be able to find and discover new places by your own .despite the fact that you might get lost sometimes , the beauty comes at the end of the trip in finding what like .traveling alone forces you to learn how to read maps and to be on your own in the middle of no where .for example , studying the map before traveling is a good way of specifying where to go and what the best shortcuts are .it teaches how self-confidence and being more mature .relying on others is not going to help you when those people are not around to risk you .finally , traveling alone with some people you like is better than joining a group of people and being attached with them where the tour guide take them .to travel alone will increase the chances of going to the places that you like and the pleasure of discovering new one .it will teach you how to read map
