in order to answer this question thouroughly , we first need to define what we mean under the words `` understanding  and `` learning  .a student has understood an idea once he is able to explain it with his or her own words , to provide examples and to link the idea to other ideas .he should also be able to compare it or to constrast it with other ideas .learning , on the other hand , refers to factual knowledge that can be acquired by means of memory .given the definitions above , one can easily imagine that understanding concepts requires more skills than just knwing facts by heart .sutdents will need to think further , to analyze and to link oncepts together when they understand them .for example , in order to understand the literary movemement called `` naturalism  , students will need to distinguish it from realism and to have an idea of what is determinism .learing facts about naturalism would not allow students to really grasp the main point about it .they would be able to name naturalist writers such as stephen crane or jack london , eventually to provide a definition learnt by heart , but not to place the movement in its literary context .another important advantage of understanding is that it creates a structure in the mind that can be reapplied in many different domains .once a students understands how a mechanical feature of the car , he will be able to understand the mechanical feature of many other cars , even if they differ .it is basically the same principle .learning , on the other hand , always needs to be done again and again because it is specific to one thing .i agree that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .however , a good student who does not have any factual knowledge is not a student .a student of swiss history has to know that switzerland was founded in 1291 .usually , a thourough , complete understanding can not be separated from learning .
