in 20 years , there will be significantly more cars in use than there are today .looking at the case from a global point of view , we find that there are huge parts of the world which are now strongly underdevelopped regarding the use of cars , e.g. china and south east asia .nevertheless they are growing fast .this willl outnumber the decrease of the number of cars in western europe and north america .main factorsthe main factors for the growth or decrease of car use are the cost of individual mobility , i.e. fuel costs , the costs of the cars themselves , the environmental costs , the need and desire for mobility and the wealth of nations .those factors differ strongly among the nations .coststhe costs of individual mobility can be regarded as fast growing all over the world .petroleum will soon be difficult to get , alternative fuels are not yet strongly developed .environmental costs can hardly be estimated , but are undoubtedly much higher than we think .europeregarding the european or american individual , use of cars will certainly decrease during the next twenty years .today many families e.g. in western germany notice that they can no longer afford a second car due to the increase in fuel costs .in addition , not only the fuel but also the cars themselves .the need for mobility will decrease as the average age rises and the employment rate sinks .south asiaregarding the south east asian , especially the chinese individual , use of cars will increase strongly .growing wealth and strong industrial growth will lead to rise in the number of cars that coul be compared to the rise in europe and america during the second half of the 20th century .environmental costs are high , but need not be paid at once .conclusionduring the next twenty years the increase of the number of cars in asia will outnumber the decrease of the number of cars in europe and america , although the costs will rise permanently .the impact of fuel costs on the use of cars will strike in about 10 years .the number of cars globally seen will therefore strongly increase during the next 10 years and begin to decrease rapidly in the 2030s .
