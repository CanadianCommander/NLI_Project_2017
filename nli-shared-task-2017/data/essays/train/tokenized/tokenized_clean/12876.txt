it is common opinion , that successful people have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .when i think of a successful discovery , the first thing that comes to my mind is the discovery of america .christopher columbus tried to find a new sea way to india .but instead of finding a cheaper and better connection to india , he discovered america by accident .he took the risk of failure , because many people believed , that there can just exist one possible seaway .the thesis , that the earth is a plate and not a globe , supported their idea .instead of taking the usual , common way , christoph columbus tried to risk something new and succeeded in the end .but at the same time , new experiements and ideas ma also turn into a catastrophy .one example can be the invention of nuclear weapons .einstein did not intend to destroy the world with his discovery .but if a new invention or knowledge gets into the wrong hands , it can also be used an evil way .atomic bombs are now used to destroy life instead of secure it .another reason , why past traditions , ideas and ways are as equal important as new discoveries and inventions is the learning aspect .people have to learn from their failures and mistakes , in order to succeed further .however , some things can only develope when they had been already experienced before .in this way , people could discover their positive and negative aspects .we need the knowledge and the traditions of the past in order to find new and easier ways .at the one hand , it is important to develope new ideas to achieve success .but at the other , people are just able to learn , when they understand and observe past ideas and thesis .
