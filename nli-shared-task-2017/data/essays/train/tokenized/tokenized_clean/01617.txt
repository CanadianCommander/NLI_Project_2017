i wo nt agree with the statement given that `` it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjectspecialization in one particular subject will keep a person with whole knowledge of the subject and he will be able clear any number of doubts on that particular subject .he will eventually become professionalised in that particular subject .there is also a proverb that `` practice makes man perfect  .if a person is specialised and got propfessionalised in his own subject then eventually he will be recognised in the society for his knowledge and efficient work in that subject .as he got the recognition about the knowledge and efficient work he got in a particular subject he will be able to get more chances from many companies or from researching centers to develop his carrer .and the door of success will get opened wider for his career to develop further .when comes to the person having knowledge with many academic subjects , he will have less accuracy about the subjects he really familiar with .the one truth every one knows that `` rolling stone gathers no mass  will describe how foolish to think to be get familiarised of many subjects at a time .in this way he will be partially professional in all the subjects he known and looses many important gains in life .from all the inferences given above one could say that specialization in one particular subject will be better when compared with the knowledge of many academic subjects .
