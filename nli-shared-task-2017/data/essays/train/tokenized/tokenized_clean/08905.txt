i personally do not agree with the following statement .today , people are used to live using their cars and i do not belive that they can change their habits in only twenty years .for example , i live far from the place i study and to reach the university i drive my car for 30 minutes everyday .expecially in italy , where i live , trains and busses are not really efficent .people here need the car for living , different ways of moving in italy are really not popular .however , i think that in countries like japan , where trains and busses work well and are always on time , things might be really different in 20 years .the conciousnes about the fact that pollution is destroing nature and wild-life is higher .anyway , i find that people are usually selfish and absolutely not able to change the world .only few people care about our world and think about the future humans and animals will live here .furthermore , i find that governments should be more responisble when this problem is tackled .cars will not be fewer is the countries do not give a different way to move to people .tomorrow i have to go to the university and if even i love my country and this world , i will use my car because there are no other ways for me to get to the university .twenty years are not enough to change people s mind .i think that if people start now to use less their cars maybe in a century something might be seen , not earlier .anyway , the use of cars is still attractive because of the promotion companies like bmw , toyota , audi do .cars is still a business , it is still one of the most important businesses of a country and it is absolutely not easy to change something in people s mind when there is no interest in the society .
