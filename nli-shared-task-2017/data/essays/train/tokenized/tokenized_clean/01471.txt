i agree with the statement that the important thing for students is to understand about the idea and concepts rather than learning about the facts .since when we get an idea and concept about a particular lesson then we can easily solve any problems in that lesson .this type of learning will have greater benefits in students not only in case of studies but also in our daily life .for example , in case of studies if we are studying about the drug mechanism , in this if we understand the idea and concept of drug mechanism we can say its use and the side effects of that drug on the body .but where as if we learn about the facts about large number of drugs and its side effects then to remember them it creates a greater problem but it is easier if we know the idea and concept i.e mechanism of the drug .when we have greater understanding of the idea and the concept we finally achieve a better result but it is not possible in case of learnig the fact .understanding the idea and concept leads to more easier way for studying as well as in playing , maintaining health etc.in case of playing we if have the concept of how to play then we can easily play the game but it is not true with that of learning the fact .inorder tomaintain health the main important thing is to kanoe about the process to maintain a good health that it means we should have a good idea .thus in any of the subjects whether it may be science , maths .arts , etc idea and the concept is really an imporatnt thing that every student should know .with this idea and concept we should then practice as many times as possible .if a student has a greater ability to understand the idea ant the concept he will certainly do good in the exam even if is unprepared for the exam where as the student who do not have the concept he has more chances of not doing well in the exam .hence , i conclude that an idea and concept is the basic and fundamental principe for students rather than learning the fact .
