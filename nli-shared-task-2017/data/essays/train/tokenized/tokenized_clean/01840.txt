i think it is more important understand ideas and concepts of the things than learns only the facts , but i also think it is important that you learn real facts of the ideas and the concept you have learned before .when you study something that is not obvious or immediatly rapportable at the real life , for example math , if you are a student , you ll ask to yourself why are you learning it ; on the other hand , if you plans a little information program , you ll know immediatly what are you doing and why .if a boy decide that he is nt interested much more on the why of the things , he should have to learn only how something is done .this is the case of most of the physical jobs like sellers or something else .otherwise , if you are interested on ideas , you can learn a lot of things .if you study properly something , you ll discover that all in the wolrd , is strictly related , for example the same laws that govern electricity , govern also the the water flooding .in spite of this , if you do nt learn any real facts , you might loose any capacity of use what you learned ; in facts i know a lot o people that are famous professor at university , that are nt able to take care of a flower , or they are not able to make most of the simplest house works .when i was younger , i attended a technical school .there , i learn how to make an information program , how to build a little integrated circuit , and similar things , but i did nt really understand what i was doing .only when i came to the university , i discovered that the things i was doing were not a `` god present  , but were something that came out from the laws i did nt studied .finaly , i think if you want to become somebody , you ll have to study the ideas of the things but you will also learn the facts .
