if we are taking about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least as many cars as today .it is a possibility that in modern countries , we will use the car less and less with the pass of the years .we live in growing cities , every day a higher pertentage of the population lives in cities .and every one that live in a big city can tell you the unusefull and expensive bussines is to have a car .is much more eficent to take the public transportation system or even a motorbike , or even a bike .any of this solutions is cheaper and faster than moving thoughout the city by car .in addition we have the problem of the petroleum .we are aproaching to the famous peak oil .some day in the close future we could not attend all the energetic demand of the world just with oil .so oil and fuel will enhance his prizes , and having a car will be more and more expensive every day .so not every one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it as today .but in the other hand there are a lot of high populated contries , developing countries .is reasonable to suppose that many people of these contries will be rich enough to pay for a car and its manteinance .also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbols of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary .so although in europe and the usa , we will probably have less cars , in china , india or brasil the number or cars will certently increase a lot in the next few decades .so this is the reason i do not agree the statement above .
