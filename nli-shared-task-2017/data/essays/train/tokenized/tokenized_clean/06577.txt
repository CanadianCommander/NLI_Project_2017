i agree with the statement that says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .learnig facts is also important for stuedents , but if they do not understand what that means or what the concept is from then it would not help students .the students will forget the things what they learned if they do not extactly understand the concept .also , if students keep learning facts and do not make it as their own , students would not be able to make the next step or can not make more things from what they learned .i think the point of studying or learning is that students can get lots of knowledges that they did not know , not just make students learn facts and do not understand what that means .i have a few reason for my statement .first , some students just memorize lots of things a day before the test and forget everything right after the test .however , if they really understood what that meant and what that concept s meaning is , they would not had to memorize all the facts , but just read it over so they can re-make sure what they learned .i have read the korean famous newsletter , and it said that they had an experiment about the students  memorization with what they really understood and with what they just heard about it and did not get the concept of it .the fact was that almost every students from that experiment could remember longer what they really understood what it meant than that they just memorzied even they did not get the meaning of it .next , students would be able to make their own next step from what they learend if they understood the idea and the concept of it .it is more important for students to understand what they learn because if they do not get the meaning and the concept of it , students would not remember anything even after just few days later .that is not the purpose of learning .however , if students get the ideas , then they would be able to think more about it and maybe ask more about that idea to the teacher .one of korean famous ceo said that he still remembers lots of things that he learned when he was in the middle school .i think making the facts for their own is the biggest thing .lastly , i think `` learning  does not mean just knowing the facts , but understanding what it truely means .i like the way of studying in north america because they do not just make students memorize the things but share their ideas .however , korean s studying way is not the same .so korean students get difficulties in sharing their own thoughts or their opinions because they really did not une
