in my view , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .being successful means standing out of the crowd , which also means doing something different than most of the people .many of us like to keep doing something the same way they always have , for example a doctor always gives the same medication because it works and it has been proven safe for the patient .in contrast a successful doctor might try a new combination of medications to treat a patient .there s the risk that this new combination simply does nt work , or worse , that it makes complications and therefore puts a life at risk .but it could also cure the patient , which the old medication would nt have .and the doctor would be successful .there are numerous examples like that in medicine .another example is an example of early history .first people were hunting and collecting food such as plants , then someone must have had the idea to try and cultivate the plants as well and to have domestic animals .maby they had problems first , but it worked .population size increased because of the better food supplies and people did nt have to move around like they had to , when looking for new hunting grounds .people who tried that first successfully had an advantage over the hunting people , who were dependent on a good hunt .another example are inventions like trains .of course , technical improvements were a key factor .people already had means of transportation like horses , but some people wanted to try something new in order to reach another place in a faster way .so they invented the train .at the start most people were afraid , they belived that the great velocity would make them ill .but after a while they got used to it and trains and those who built them got successful .could you imagine our world without trains ?i ca nt and i m happy that some people like to try new things and take risks , otherwise our world would stand still .in conclusion these examples show that taking risk is a major point of being successful , without taking risks and trying new things everyone would be mediocre and no progression would be made whatsoever .
