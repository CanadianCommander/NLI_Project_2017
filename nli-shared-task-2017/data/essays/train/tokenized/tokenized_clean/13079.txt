although some advertisements state the truth , i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are .nowadays , modern societies face an overflow of products in the stores .people are overwhelmed and often have a hard time to decide what type of product or brand they should choose .all they can rely on is their own experience in the past and the recognition of familiar and advertised brands .if a manufacturer wants to be successful in selling his products , he is forced to invest time and money in advertisement .having the best product is just not enough to guarantee a manufacturer s success .a manufacturer has to identify the needs of his targeted customers and address these needs in his marketing propaganda .a customer normally buys a product in order to satisfy his or her needs .examples of needs are youth , beauty , mobility or entertainment .in the end , it all comes down to how to proper build up a brand that is related to certain values .imagine that you are standing in front of a shelf in a cosmetic store that contains 25 different brands of shampoo .which one do you decide to take ?would it not be the brand you just recently saw on tv , the one that promises healty , shiny , good smelling hair ?in my opinion , branding is the key to success .and the better you understand to link certain criterias that represent needs of customers with a brand , the more successful you are .it really does not matter if your product is better than the product of anyone else .as long as you offer reasonable quality and deliver the `` right message  your product is requested .for instance , dewalt offers a low quality product with a rather weak service .however , their marketing is so outstanding that they have the biggest share in rotating lasers .the reason is that they know perfectly how to advertise their products .even there are companies in the rotating laser market with far better products and service , people tend to buy their products from dewalt .they have used the product in the past and believe what they were told in the advertisement .however , one point has to be mention .as long as the needs of a customer are met the customer will return to a company and by its brand .if he experiences once that the product does not perform in a satisfying way , he might switch to another brand .as a result , manufacturers have to take advantage of advertisement and present their products as perfect as possible .though , they also have to be cautious that they do not exaggerate .
