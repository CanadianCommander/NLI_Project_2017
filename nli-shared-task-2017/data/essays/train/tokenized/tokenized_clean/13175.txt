it is a common saying that older people do nt have so much fun in life than younger people .or that you have to use the time when you are young , because the old age comes very fast and then there is nothing left in life that you can enjoy .therefore , it is a very controverse topic to be discussed if young people enjoy life more than older people do .i disagree with this statement , because there are many reasons that show the difference .there is a saying telling that you are always as young as you feel .i think that is perfectly right .my mother who is 52 years old does nt behave like she is over 50 which is a very old age for young people .she wears modern clothes like my sisters and i and she listens to the same music .she does what she wants to do and enjoys life as much as possible .another point is that you ca nt say to an old maybe also handicapped person that he or she does nt enjoy life .a friend of my grandmother is about 76 years old and despite her leg injury she enjoys life and has a very positive attitude .an example of how she enjoys life are her various trips with a group of older people .twice a year this group travelles to places in europe by bus .they do nt go hiking anymore , but they visit museums or famous buildings .in addition to that , they are together with many people at the same age and with the same interests .everytime this woman comes home from one of those trips she is really happy , because she has enjoyed it so much that she wants to go on the next trip again .concluding i can say that by regarding various older people i m sure that older people enjoy life as much as young people do .the only difference is that the activities and events which make people enjoy life might differ between young and old .
