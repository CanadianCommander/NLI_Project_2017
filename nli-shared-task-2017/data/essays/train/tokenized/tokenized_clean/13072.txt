with new useful inventions or working methods someone can make much money in less time .the question is , if this person needs tu be risky or not - or if someone who does it the old `` normal  way , could not succeed .first of all in my opinion everybody can be very successful in every little job or things he does .if he wants to , he will do good and will not need some new ways or risks to work it out with more success .he perhaps will last longer for that thing he wants to reach but he will reach the end much more safer .if you dare more like other companies , do not mean that you risk more .you can check and double check and if your idea is not good , you can try again .in modern world nobody will throw a new product on market without several tests of customers .everybody tries to reduce the risk to a minimum .on the other side a really new idea needs a big starting amount .this big investition does not guarantee the profit and the success .this of course could then open a door to a higher level of money but is very risky , because nobody can say , if people will accept the new product or not .in the fast changing internet and mobile world , often you just have to be the faster one and this person .new inventions like ebay are able to have millions of customers , it is just the idea , that counts .in conclusion i think it is not necessary for a new company to be risky or to dare too much .first of all you have to check the guarantee of success and if the idea of the company is good , the success will come in a much more safer way .
