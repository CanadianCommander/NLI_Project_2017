as a country progresses , enhances its economic power , it also leads to an increase in the purchasing power of the people in the country .in twenty years time , people are expected to have higher incomes and purchasing power than at present .having a house and a car are basic necessities and it does seem indispensable to most of us .i totally disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are at present .i will support my opinion in the following paragraphs .the first reasoning that i would like to put forward is that as a country is moving from an under-developed to being a developing country or a developing country to a developed country , over time it will lead to increase in employment levels , which will subsequently lead to a rise in the income levels and purchasing power of the people .for instance , in my own country , india , there are a lot of individuals and families who own cars today than the last twenty years .the traffic for cars in cities like delhi and bombay , where the income levels are rising rapidly , there is also evidence of more number of cars in such places .the statistics show the number of persons owning cars have only been increasing over the years .the second reason that i would advance for my argument is , that car is a very convenient mode of transportation .personally , i feel , it is more convenient for most of us than air planes , bikes , buses and other modes of transportation .it offers a kind of flexibility which is incomparable .its very practical for everyday use .the third reasoning would be it has a lot of utility for people with families , which all of us do !a situation where most people are owning their own air planes or buses is not quite palatable to me .cars have also become very sophisticated and user-friendly these days .there are a whole whole of models and prices to choose from .to conclude , cars , in my opinion , falls under the category of a ` need  and not a ` luxury  .what could possible happen twenty years down , is that the cars could get even more sophisticated .there could be even more models for cars , much more than what is present today .
