in my opinion , the appropriatness of traveling in a group led by a tour guide depends on the nature of the person and the place to be travelled .for an enthusiast like me , the schedule of a group travel will be very binding and i wo nt be able to enjoy as much .but for elderly people and people with kids , it will be more enjoyble if everything is taken care of by a tour guide .but in some circumstances , tour group becomes very essential .for example , if i am travelling in a foreign country and i do nt know their language , i will prefer travelling in a tour group .by doing that , i will save the pain of ordering wrong things on the menu , and more importantly , i wo nt keep loosing my way because of sign boards written in a foreign language .also , if i am travelling to a place of historical importance , i would like to be led by a tour guide who can give me more information about that place .in situations , when i have very little time on hand and there are lots of places to see , i think i will be better off as a part of a tour group .or else , i ll waste most of my time , finding and reaching all the tourist spots on my own .on the other hand , if i am going on an adventure trip for camping and trekking , tour groups will be the last thing on my mind .also , if i am on a spiritual or relaxing trip , to a calm place with not many things to explore , the tour group will not be very useful .i feel tour groups led by tour guides are important , but it depends on travellers discreation to decide if it is the best way to travel .as a conclusion , i would like to state that i do not agree with the given statement .
