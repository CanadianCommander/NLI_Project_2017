nowadays young people tend to be only concerned about stupid things , like thier friends and their physical aspect , and they do not help their communities at all .young people do not understand that our society will only work if we take care of it , because the society is made up of people and without them it will be nothing at all .therefore we should start helping in our community .during summer i usually help the community of my town , that has the job of feeding old people in their retirement houses .we are always looking for people that can help us , because it is a pretty hard work , but people of my age prefer to waste their summer time sleeping or playing videogames rather than helping people that truly need some help .i am totally disgusted in seeing how much our society has destroyed the value of generosity and unselfishness .money are now considered one of the most important aspect of our life and we tend to forget that there are more important moral values that we should care about .in my opinion people should spend at least 2 months of their life doing some community service , because it is a great experience that completely changes your life and opens your mind .before i started my job in my community i was kind of skeptic , because i was afraid that the reality i was going to face was too hard for me , but know after three summers i worked in the field i can say that i am changed : now , i care more about other people and i always try to see the positive side of every situations , because i understood that there will always be people with more difficulties than me .anyway if someone chooses to help his community , there will be tons of possibility from helping old people as i do , or working with disable people or participating in a youth group .however convincing people to help is extremely hard if we do not change our society a little bit before .i think television should give more relevance to community projects and volunteering services , because helping other people should one of our first values .
