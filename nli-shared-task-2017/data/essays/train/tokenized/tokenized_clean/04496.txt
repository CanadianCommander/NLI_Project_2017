in my opinion , i strongly believed that in a close future there will be more cars in use than nowadays .i support this statement because of all the thinks that i see each day of my life .to begin , the population of the world is increasing each day .this situation is concentrated in africa and asia .the previsions for the future population in these counties are that it is going to growth and it is not going to stop .i have also notice that the number of cars sold in these countries are increasing very fats and the number of person for each car is decreasing .that mean that in a few years they are going to approuch and reach the us and europe statistics about the number of slof cars per inhabitant .another reason why i thing there will be more cars in the future is that the cars are becoming less and less expensive due to the competiveness of the car market and of the new technologies that allows car constructors to produce at a lower price than ever .so , it is much more easier to have a car now that 5 years ago .i think that this situation is not going to change and i am sure that this situation is going to be implemented .furthermore , the proportion of people who lives in the big cities is increasing not only in asia and africa but also in europe and the us and the percentage of people for each car in the cities is much bigger than in the countryside .so it will cause and increasing of cars in use .to conclude , the increasing in the population of the world and the proportion of people who lives in the cites , the amelioration of the technologies and the are three reasons why i disagree with the statement that say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
