in ancient korea , there was country called cho-sun .the king of cho-sun , sejong , said that knowledge gives people to live with a fortune , and hope .but knowing many knowledge , but just half of it is worths nothing at all .the world we live in now , information and speciallity became the most valuable item to get a job or success and get lots of money .if a man who have broad knowledge of many academic subjuects , he sure will be having not much problem to live and he probably wo nt get stuck by some kind of problem .but if its me ?i would rather gamble my life to become the best not just middle .having a sepcific but deep knowledge about one subject .it can be very dangerous thing .he should worry about even he is specified about that knowledge , what happens if the world , the society thinks that that subject isnt that usefull and not important .because he is speicified to it , he could not be able to get a job leaving that subject .but , like this days he is specified in a subject that is so usefull in this world .he will be welcomed by anyplace that he goes , and he will get lots of money and people would see and get to him closer .what ever people chose , i think that a man or a woman should have faith on the subject that they like and want to know about .and with out a doubt keep going on within that subject .
