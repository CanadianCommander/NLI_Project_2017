i will totaly disagree with statement , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .because cars are the main source of travelling to the people rather than buses and aeroplanes .it is very easily avilable to the people in the future generation because it is reducing it price .in olden days the available of cars will be only to people who born with yhe silver spoon .as the need of car is increaseing the price of the car is comeing down and now it more easily available to the comman people .the car manufatures came with different tecnology and design depending upon the usage and the requriment of the peopleand they developed some 1000 models of cars since it came to the market and with latest tecnology of using fuel less and getting mailage more .there are many units inthis car manufacture some of them are ford , suzuiki , toyoto , maruthi , tata hundai , hondaand lots more .they are design according to our reqiurements .and there number will increase in future also .and now ther doing experiments to introduce non - fuel cars in the market it will bring great change in the development of cars .though i accept that there are some advantage there are disadvantage the fuel used in cars release the corbon dioxide in the nature which will cause health hazards so the measure are taking to prevent .and to invent nonuse if fuel cars and they travel with help of eletricity which is very benificial .and another one is accidents done by the cars , accidents will go with each and every vehicle it all depends on how great you drive them .as the depand is increaseing usage of cars also increase rather than bikes which more source of accidents .cars will increase in future 20 years
