i tend to disagree with this statement .first of all , young people , who take part in youth organizations such as the scouts do regularly provide services to their communities by organizing activities to collect funds to finance some community projects or to help volunteering organizations in their work .they also often visit older people or people suffering from serious diseases in hospitals .secondly , i disagree with the use of the term `` nowadays  in the proposed statement .older people always complain about the fact that modern societies are not as good as the societies in the past .i refuse to accept this idea .people have the tendency to remember better the good and nice things they saw a long time ago than the bad things that occured to them in the past .this is , according to me , the main reason why societies in the past seem to be better than the society we presently live in .therefore , even though people might think that children and teenagers do not help their communities enough , believing that it was different before is a mistake .people always provided help for their communities and other people always complained that it was not enough .nothing here is new .thirdly , the degree by which young people help their community depends on the culture and the tradition of the country in which they live .drawing universal conclusions is acording to me not as evident when it comes to an evaluation of whether young people are involved with providing help for their community or not .as a matter of fact , it can be true that in some regions of the world , young people quite individualists in their point of views and therefore will not think easily about helping others without a financial or another compensation for themselves .but in other regions , such for example chine , young children and teenagers get used to help others for free since a very young age .in these societies , young people will therefore quicklier go to help their communities .in short , people always did and always will complain about the fact that young people do not help enough their communities but i disagree wiht them .i think that these people do not realize that groups of young people such as the scouts help their communities as much as they can , that they forget that things were not so different in the past and that helping others without asking for compensation is for sure very much culturally determined .
