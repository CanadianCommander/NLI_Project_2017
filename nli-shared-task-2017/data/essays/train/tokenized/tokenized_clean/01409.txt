i agree with that statement because of these reasons .at first , understanding ideas is really significant for students when they learn new study , for example , when i was a high school student , i started learing physics .i t was dificult for me to learn facts and formulas withought understanding ideas .i could remenber facts , but i did not understand and put into long term memory .however , when i was taught the idea of physics by my friend , i could understand .i knew facts , so it was easy to accompany that idea and facts .if i learned idea and concept first , i would remember important formulas and facts for a long time .thus , understanding concepts is more important for students .in addition .understanding ideas and concept is helpful to student .when i took ` american government  class , the instructors explained meaningful concept of this class befor telling facts .he introduced huge image of this corse , and he suggested ideas of each terms for this class .i am an international student , and i was not used to american government , because his introduction was really helpful for me .if he introduced just facts or facts , i would not get importance of this class and be interested in american government .therefor students can take advantages by understanding ideas and concepts .although learning facts is also meaningful , it does not help students .when students want to know something , learning facts is useful because they do not have to spend much time .however , if they understand something , it does not function .understanding ideas and concepts does not mean only obtaining idea , but also learing facts .in my opinion , understanding and learing are accompanied with each othere .when students gain someting , they should understand that , and then they can learn facts deeply .thus , i agree this statement .
