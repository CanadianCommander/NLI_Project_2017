`` life is a game , if we do nt try , we wo nt know what treasure are there  this sentence i heard my father when he decided to quit his job and to begin a new career .fifteen years ago , my father served in military , but right now he is a successfual business man .some people like to try new things and take risks .other tend to only doing what they already know how to do well .i totally agree with this sentence because of my father .it is extremely difficult to be success if people d , do nt take risk or how do they know how to be success .as my father an example , when my father wanted to qiut his nice job which works for government and has nice salary , all his family disagree with my father and only my mother supported him because my mother know that if my father keep doing his same job , my father s life is that  all .even though my father had a hard time on his new job but now he get to it very well .he makes more money than when he was a army .another support reason is to try new thing and take risks help people to obtain different experience to be success .for example , when my father was an army , he only knew to obey oders and to be royal to his government and nothing else ; however , since he got rid of his job , he commounciate with this world , talked to people and be familiar with this society .he has gained different knowledge from what he learned in military school , although my father is not major in business , because of his own background , it provides my father to do business darling and people like to exchang business with my father .satying in same position is not bad ; however , if people want to be successful , to try new things or take some risks are necessary .
