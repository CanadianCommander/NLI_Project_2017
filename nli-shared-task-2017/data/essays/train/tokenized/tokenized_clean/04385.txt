i agree because tour guide is little expensive and i have to travel alot of people .but tour guiders are has lot of information and i can saw lot of thing .i can go some college or some musems or some shopping malls .tour guiders explains very collectly .i can travel some famous or population some where .and i can speak lot of people and i can made some friends .but some people are very dirty , no respects .and it is better than travel family or alone .for example if i traveled with my family it is spend lot of money because we live america not long times and we can not found place .
