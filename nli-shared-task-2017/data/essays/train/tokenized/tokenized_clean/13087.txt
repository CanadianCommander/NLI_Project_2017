beeing an expert in many fields is very hard , nearly impossible .everyone has been confronded making the choice between having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .knowing a little in many fields provides a lot of advantages .first , beeing able to understand , even react , over a subject .it can help to recognize the experts from the others .even if you want to be an expert , you know from where to start , where you could gather informations .knowing a few experts in the field could provides a lot of value .for instance , let say you are a project manager dealing with a project involving differents academic subjects .covering all the subjects would be more helpful from beeing an expert in one specific subject because you could draw a general scheme of the whole system .the project structure is a lot more valuable than beeing able to build one part of the system , you just need to hire a few experts to get it done .one the other hand , beeing an expert in a specific field is great .it can be easy to get hired from a company that really needs an expert with a high salery .for instance , a few decade ago , air france had made a system written in a specific programming language to handle all their client reservations .a few years later , they needed to modify that program in emergency but nobody was able to program in that old language .they finally found an expert but he asked a lot of money and he got it .to conclude , you ca nt tell weather having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one specific subject .it really depends on the work you want to do , the opportunities you will be given wo nt be the same .
