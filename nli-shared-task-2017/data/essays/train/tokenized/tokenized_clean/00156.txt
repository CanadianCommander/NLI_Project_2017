in our society time is running and we only have or take little time to discover a foreign country .and in these few days which are always not enough everything worth seeing has to be vistited .additionaly it all should happen in an easy going way because no one wants to be stressed on his or her vacation .therefore a guided tour may be the best way .there are many possibilities as well .it ranges from adventure tours containing sleeping in a tent under the sky until the more luxury one with a nice four or five star hotel included .furthermore a guide most times knows the area like the back of his hand so no questions will be unanswered and every beautiful and famous place or building will be visited .but there are also some negative things by joining a guided tour .most times only the tourist spots are visited which are subsequently crowded with tourists from all the other tours .so it is always worth it to find a tour that has additionally some points away from the usual places .of course some things ` have  to be vistited but in every country are several unknown places which are at least as remarkable although they do not appear in every tourist information book .and there are of course some people who will do everything on their own .most times this means more planing or a very spontaneous lifestyle .but these people will probably have more contact with locals and a total difference experience and view of the visited country .in conlusion i think it is the most convenient way to travel in a group led by a guide because you can see all ` important  buildings or landscapes but i would never go so far to say it is the best way , because that is something everyone has to choose of his or her own .
