the french education system put a premium on the theorycal knowledge , contrary to other education system which emphasis parctical knowledge .which of the two could be the best ?understand ideas and concepts is the base to be able to undersand the reality , the current events in the entire world .indeed , theorical knowledge and culture permit to be open minded , to analyse a situation with the nessary competence .for example , a brilliant manager has to know a great variety of information to make the righ choice .moreover , france promotes the ` classes preparatoire  , it is two year of hard work to integrate the best business schools .to succed the exam , you have to learnt a great amount of concepts : you have to study mathmatics , economics , philosophy , history .the goal of this learning is to give you kwonledge to cope with all types of situations , in every day life , at work . ..but on the other hand , to understand concepts is no suficient .i think it is something very interresting and useful , but students have to learn facts too .for example , certain adults did not study long time when they were young and they succed in life because they used their practical competences and their work experiences .so it is important for students to do training periods for example .to conclude , i think these two types of learning are linked , so they have the same impotance for me because if students know many concepts and they stay far from reality , it is a problem because in their future , for their career , both competences are required .
