i do believe that it is very important to have a wide culture in many and apparentely differents subjects .subject that as a fist approach can seams radically different are in the end just a different develop of the same initial path .an example comes from the classic greek where phylosophers were the fist astronomists and mathematicians .i think that only having a broad knowledge of different subjects is possible to go deeper in a specific ones with later studies .the risk to be too much specialized from the begin is to not be able to approach an eventual problem in a different way .an example is when i was a student at the university and i was attending the mathematical classes , at that time i was really surpriced how students cominig from classical studies , after some first difficultes , became the best of the class .they were able to use the broad knowledge of different subject and use them in a specific fild .i am worry when i see schools becaming too specific in the early stages of students path .i think that industries and economic world is too in hurry to have a technician , a kind of robot able to use some specific skill well and fast .i am sure that the real progres is in the hads of people that are able to solve problems in a wide rage , because it is important that for each small change in one direction something , maybe far , will change as well .i had a specific education and many times i suffer my lack of istruction and i use most of my free time to read classical poems .
