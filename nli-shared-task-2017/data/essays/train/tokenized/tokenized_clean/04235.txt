what is the most important things we have to learn at school or at university ?that is the question . ..is the most important thing to have a good understanding of the main concepts or ideas ?or is it to learn a lot of informations , without having a good comprehension of the main concepts ?according to me , the main character for a good student at the end of the school is a good comprehension and an hability for reproducing the concepts .in your argumentation , we will present some elements in order to give our own opinion .first , i think it s very important for a student to be abble to reproduce the main ways of a reflexion .for example , concerning a mathematical exercise , a student wil be judged about his hability to do again the problem with different informations .so that s more important , it isnt the basic informations but the way of reflexion .it s generally the same for evey scientific topics .to my mind , it s better to understand the general ideas until of the general facts .secondly , i believe for general facts as the history facts , students have all time to learn it in the free time .for example , i do nt think a little boy , if he does nt know the name of the actual president , will be a bad student .on the contrary , this boy can have the informations by other ways : television , news-paper , radio . ..and i do nt think the perfect student is the student who knows everything concerning all the topics .so for me , a good student will generally curious and in the most cases , he will search the informations by his owns capabilities .last but not least , it s clear that understanding concepts is more important in the real life that learning a lot of facts .in fact , if a young student has many habilities in learning his history lessons at the age of 8 years , but without understanding concepts , it will probably be hard for him to continue high school .so it s necessary to early learn comprehension and understanding .to sum up our reflexion , it appears that understanding the main ideas and concepts is very important for a student who wants to integrate an high school .the facts are also important , but we have all the time to get it , whereas it is not the case for the general comprehension .
