i disagree with the statement , according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .it is true that the use of cars increase the problem of pollution , especially in big cities , where lives thousands of people .in this cities often people have traffic problems .you are not able to go because of the excess of circulating cars .and when you reach the place you were going to , it is always hard to find parking .another thing is the raise of the cost of oil .some scientist says that oil on earth is going to finish .but it s also true that cars producers spend a lot of money in order to find new fuels , less expensive and cheaper .then i think that many people consider car the most comfortable way to move from one place to another , and they wo nt adapt themself by taking the bus or the train , even if it would be cheaper .another thing is that trains , buses and airplanes does nt cover all the goals that a person might have , and have precise time , which they have to respect .with the car you can go where you want and when you want , and for this reason many people prefer take the car , like i do .then there are also the emerging countries , like china .cars sold in this countries has increased also by two-three hundred per cent , because of the industrialization .i think that twenty year is too little to see a decrease in the use of cars .maybe it will happen , but it will take much more time than twenty years , also because of the interest of big industries , which influence most of the decisions taken by each government .
