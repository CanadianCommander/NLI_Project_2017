i do not think that this statement is right for all the young people nowadays .i would say that it is like it ever was in history .some people engage for their surrounding and some others are not interested in it .you can not say that all the young people do not give enough time to others .that would impline that for exampple 50 years ago they did .it is right that it would be good if young people would engage more for others , but that is not a specific problem of young people but of the society .there are not only the youngs who do not care about the needs and problems of other people but also the grown-ups .i know a lot of examples where people had a big probleme like an accident .they could not do their housework on their own , but nobody out of the neighbourhood offered help to this people .at the moment i am doing a course so thst i get educated to visit and help old persons who can not get along on their own and there i here lots of terrible stories about the ignorance of young and older people .but i think if there would be more offers for courses perhaps more people would engaged .lots of people want to help , but are afraid to do something wrong .they think that for example by staying some hours with an old helpless lady they could make a terrible mistake so that the woman falls down and breaks a leg or kind of that and in the worst case dies .so they do not offer help for not getting in such a situation .it is the task of the government of a state to offer courses to the people so that the people get the confidence in themselves to help others .it is not always the point that people are not willing to do something but they do not feel able to do it .if they would feel lots of them would be willing to help others and spend time for them although you never should expect too much .
