i disagree to travel around with a tour guide .it will be great to travel around the places that we like is to travel by ourself because if we travel by ourself , we can spend our time freely .we do not have to care that the guide is going to go somewhere in a few minutes or they are going to spend a lot of time at the places that you do not really like .it will also be relax to travel by yourself , you can wake up in the hotel whenever you want , you can go to eat anything you like in any time .ane you can also have changes in your trips .in order to have a good trip for ourself , it will be good to just go to the places that we like and spend our time in the things that we are interested in .if we go with a guide , we only have limit time in all the places .and there might be some places that we do not like .we always want to feel relax on our trips .we are not there for business , we are there to have fun .so if we go there with a guide , we will have to followed the rule of the guide and we will have to get up in the time that they want us to get up .there will always have some accidents in our trips and it will be good for us to make some changes in order to solve those problems .but if we go there with a guide , our plan has already been decided .we would not have any chances to change our plan .for these three reasons , i recomand that we should go on a trip by ourself but not be leading by other people .
