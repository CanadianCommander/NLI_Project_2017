nowadays , in europe and north america , almost each family owns at least one car .however , a few current issues raise the question of the number of cars there will be in the next twenty years .in my opinion , there will be more car in use in twenty years than today .first of all , it is obvious that the world s population keeps increasing , which means that more people are going to need a car within the next two sdecade .moreover , in important demographic regions such as china or india , more and more inhabitants buy a car .what s more , one reason for which there could be fewer cars in use in twenty years would be the lack of oil .nonetheless , according to scientists this should not happen before the year 2050 .besides , in order to fight against the air pollution issue mainly due to the car s traffic , scientists try to find out solutions , and work on other energy ressources such as solar energy , or even hydrogen energy .then , if they eventually manage to create a new type of car which would not pollute the air , driving a car would not be a problem anymore for the atmosphere .hence , the number of cars would be likely to increase .another reason is that people tend to communicate more and more , and the road network is getting wider and wider .then , people really enjoy travelling with their own car in order to be able to meet whoever you want wherever you want .indeed , having a car provides me with a lot of autonomy .for instance , if i intend to go from one side of the country to another its is much more easier to drive my own car than to take the plane or the train , if the place i want to go is far from the airport or the train station .
