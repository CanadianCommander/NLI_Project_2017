in the city i live in you can find young people at every public place : in the streets , in the town center and on public playgrounds .often they hear loud music , disturb other people , drink alcohol or just damage something .this introduction shows that i support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities but instead they do no useful things .but what are the reasons for the behaviour of the young people , why do the spend no time for helping .one reason might be the numerous inventions which were made throughout the years .mainly the inventions for the freetime like the invention of the internet , the tv , or even the playstaion affect the young people s free time activities .many young people have all of this inventions in their homes or even in their own rooms and they are used very much .thus there might be not enough time for helping the community .moreover in the modern socity one thing is very important : to earn money .money is very important for the young children as they want to afford the above named inventions or they want to wear expensive clothes .the community service is not being payed or if it is payed it is payed it is payed worse .in a part time job young people can earn enough money to fullfilmost of their dreams .thus the young people might work in a part time job instead of supporting the local community service .besides if young people participate in helping their community they are not free any more in their spare time .they have to keep certain appointments at fixed times .so all in all i agree with the statement .
