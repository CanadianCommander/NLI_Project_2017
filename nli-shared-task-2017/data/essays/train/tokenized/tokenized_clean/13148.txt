yes i totally agree with the above statement .because we should not learn the subject but we should understand the ideas or concepts or anything related to the subject .this plays a vital role in the educational skills and improve our learning attitude .if we are very poor at these things we ca nt improve in our subject and we ca nt do better things related to the subject .for example creating new things will always be possible only when we have good knowledge about our subjects and if we start learning everything from our childhood we ca nt grow more relating in the particular field and hence if we start understanding concepts from the childhood then we can contribute alot to our fields like by doing phd s. , and then starting independent research areas and start creating in our own way will finally leads to good consequences .so everybody should be guided properly from their childhood and have a proper skills in learning things or facts .ofcourse childhood play a very crucial role in everybodies life and hence parents should take care of their children properly and guide them properly in their education , in order to become good citizens in their nation .if students wish to contribute alot in their fields then they should concentrate to grasp the subject and potray it in a good way .this ideas will probably come true for those people who are really good at their educational background and learning skills .that s why everybody should learn how to apply skills in their career and they should interact with teachers and students to improve alot .if they start interacting they cancome to about their faults and they can correct them and adapt some good skills from their friends and teachers .so communication plays a vital role in everybodies lifes .so students should maintain good habits inorder to acheive alot in their lifes and hence to contribute alot to their fields .good learning skills are the only means to get suceed in day to day competitive world and fast life .parents , teachers , friends and good habits are the primary things that affect student s lifes .depending on this everything is inter-connected and hence good family background always play an important role in children s educaton .that s why , elder should always behave properly and should think alot before they do .
