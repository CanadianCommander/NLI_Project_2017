it is generally belived that the young people in today are less interested in their neighbor than previously .althogh some young people still spent their time on helping their communities , in my opinion young people do nt enjoy their time spend with their communities no more because of development of technology and competitive education .above all , the development of technology brings about the indivisualism .in other words , because each person has amusment things such as the tv , computer , p2p in each home , people do nt need people whom we enjoy time with becasue people can enjoy enough their time using this eqpuipment .for example , when i was in secondary school , i would rather spend the time on playing game by computer than playing game with my friend in playground or house .thus , such a indivisualism allows people concentrate on just oneself , thereby making people spend more time in their house and not giving enough time to helping their communities .moreover , the competitive education make young people not helping their communities .in particular , today s educaion enable baby go to the private academy to become more smart children .in this process , young children believe that more important things in success life is concentrating on myself not others .for instance , parents prefer to their children to concentrate on only study than help other people .therfore , because such a competitive education not allow children spend their time on things except study , young people do nt have any chance to help other people .in conclusion , i agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their local neighbor any more for the reasons that i mentioned above .not only high level indivisualism but also competitive education makes young people not be able to spend their time on helping their communities .
