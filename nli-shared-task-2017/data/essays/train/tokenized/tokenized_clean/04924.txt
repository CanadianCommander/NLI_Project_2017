during an academic education , personc face with a challenging contraversion mainly , specilielazi on one subjects to study or being more versatile when makin thjis desition .in my point of view , iy seems resonable to chose , specililazing on a certain branch rather then many of them .this may lead to cultivate your knowlege diligancely in a branch and also it is more easy way to be succesfull acedemicly .first of all studying many subject at onec may seems us to know more abouth acedemicly .however when you try to be deal with many subcjects .it deduce to miss the major points of them individually .next semester for examle , i try to take extra courses as a result of my high grades , whetre i thought achive succesfully all my majors , i realize that , i miss lots off points when i try to deal whith both diffent branches .moreover specilizing in a single era , has a crucial importance for an acedemic person .if you completly understant the subject broadenly both ways , you will be able to aqcuantind about all featurs of this branch indeed , it contribute to became a major this era , and provide to expedite the time to became more adequte to acedemicly increase .of caurse i have the same manner that , working diffrent subjects may reveal to easly make preferances abouth , which of them you want to work about , however try to now lot about everyting is indisputably im possiable gaoul to achive indeed .so in conclusion , i firmly belive that to prevail the rivilies in the contraversiol u academic conditiouns may only possible to be now comprehensively about a subject indded .
