when we look into the present scenario in my country , india , one will find more number of bikes than cars .this is the case because people here are not inclined towards the luxurious goods , like car .they are more intrested in possessing those goods which are required to live a normal life .but as the rate at which the development is taking place in the country , one can expect this to change .firstly , when we look into the technological growth taking place aroung the world , one will understand that the humans are not satisfied with what they have .each and evry time they come out with a new idea to make human life more simpler .this is leading us to an age when a luxurious good in present day will be an daily necessity .people are very lasy to work hard to travel from one place to other .so they came out with the idea of bikes instead of bicycles .then came the four wheeler car .it had all the features of an bike and it also provided comfort .but the cost and maintainance of it didnt encourage many to look forward for it .nowadays , we have got the technology which can be used to manufacture cars at a cheaper cost and which can be maintained with no extra care .in future , there will be cars which guarantee more comfort , speed , luxury and efficient fuel consumption .we can even look forward for models which run with a battry or solar energy , which are renewable sources of energy , than going for petroleum fuels which are on the verge of extinction .this will encourage more number of people to buy cars .when we look it from an individual point of view , the economic growth of the country is growing at a faster rate .people are becoming wealthier and are looking forward for comforts .as in india , an normal family has four people and when ever they want to travel as a group they have to consider some outside means .but as the present day indian can afford to buy a car with his earnings , without a second thought he is going for it .the present population and the sales of the cars in the country tells the rate at which the the number of cars on the road is increasing .so , twenty years down the line , we can look forward for an india , when more half of the indians possess a car .car , which is a luxurious property nowadays will be a daily necessity at that time .
