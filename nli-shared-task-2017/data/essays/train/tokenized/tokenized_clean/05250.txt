i agree with the statement .the reasons are maybe not as straightforward as they seem and i would also argue that depending on the person , different reasons apply .for the most part though i think that education on behalf of the parents but also the teachers needs to instill a sense of social responsibility in a child .the need to help others that were not as fortunate or the community as a whole has to be developed .our education system has increasingly become a job training center where many of the aspects needed to be a leader in other settings than on the job have been neglected .while i think there are differences between urban and suburban communities , you often get the sense that people are only focused on their little microcosm .the family is much more detached from the community than it maybe was a couple of decades ago .children are unlikely to feel they need to help the community if their family is not an active and integrated part of one .young people tend to have a whole host of attractive alternatives to spend their time .whether that means sports , meeting up with friends or just spending time infront of the television .lastly , the financial situation of the family might also require the child to take on a job to chip in .helping out in the community generally is voluntary and hence , unpaid .bottomline i think it is too easy to just blame it on the young .the environment also plays a large role in whether or not a young person will spend time helping in their community .
