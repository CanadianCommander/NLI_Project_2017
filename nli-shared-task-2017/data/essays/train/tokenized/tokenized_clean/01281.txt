the belief that a life without risks is better is common among many people .but is it true ?i would like to start with an example , for it is always better to `` get the picture  before hearing arguments on a topic .cristobal colon discovered america .everybody knows that .but would that have been possible without him taking the risk of navigating into unknown waters accompained with nothing but criminals ?i do not think so .so , everybody who believes that colon was succesful should also think that to be succesful you have to try new things , to risk something .if it is not so , that is why i have further arguments .as a business administration student i have learnt that the essential aspect of having a productive and growing business is to make decisions knowing that the chance of losing is always present , but that the wish of improving should be stronger than this fear .`` use fear as a motor not as a break  some say , correctly .life can be seen as a business , you always have to do something in order to achieve what you want , it is an exchange of services for utlities .for this reason i believe the same rules , which have been precisely studied during these last years , could and should be applied to our everyday routine .lets examine the situation from another point of view .someone has achieved a state in his life , where he believes no more is to be improved .this person has a plan for the rest of his life .at the begining it will surely feel nice to have this kind of security and peace , and that is not negative .but after a while , he will get bored , for the human is the kind of specie that must always do something different in order not to get frustrated .if not , the work policies of the industrial revolution would still persist .the thing is , that by the time this individual of the example realizes he is bored , he will have lost the confidence to try new things , to risk some of that security and will enter a great frustration , not likely to maintain him in a successful state .furthermore , society and its elements are not at all stable , it changes constantly , as do the necessities of the people .in order to be succesful one has to be able to adapt fastly to these new demands , and in order to achieve that sacrifices must be done .i conclusion , i believe that the statement that risks and new creations are basic elements of success are nothing but correct .remember the automobile or a more recent example , the internet ?those are all inventions of peple who tried to do what noone else before them had , and insisted even though many thought of them as crazy .
