a more common and well accepted saying is `` it s better to be a master of one trade than be a jack of all  .being a person who would like to specialize in the field of wireless telecommunications , i disagree to the statement `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  , as against what the current world is demanding .most of the human being is talented in one specific skill .so he can concentrate and outperform well on a subject or topic that he has chosen depending on this skill .also his performance will be better when he works on this liking subject or topic .for example , a person who likes singing can contribute better if he specializes on music , as compared to his performance in other subjects .speaking about academics , a person specializes on a subject which he likes the most .he chooses that subject in which he feels he can contribute more .having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , can certainly to one extend , help a person .it will help him to have a wider aspect of thinking .for example , knowledge of mathematics will certainly help a person specializing in physics .but at the end of the day , it is what he contributes to the society that matters most .for example , albert einstein , famous for his theory on relativity , concentrated in improving his knowledge in a specific subject physics , as against scratching his head in different sciences available during that era .he was able to contribute a lot in the field of physics , though he was poor in mathematics .so i would like to summarize that , having a broad knowledge on different academic subjects will surely help a student , but specializing in a specific subject will help him to master it and in turn will help him to contribute back in that field .thus contributing to the society , more than to himself .
