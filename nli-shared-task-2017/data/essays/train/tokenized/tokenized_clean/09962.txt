i disagree with this statement that nowadays young prople do not give enough time to helping their communities .although there are a lot of news about how rediculous young people thoughts like in tv medias and newspapers , we still can see some warm events arroud our lives .in my own country , taiwan , it is very hard to see what young prople do nowadays , because the political news and international relationship with china are filled all of our news programs .but in recent event of deposing our president chen , many university students used their ideas to support this demonstration instead og using violence to insist the goveronment .some young people made conferences to discuss the solution of taiwan in the future , some young people made some files to express their thinkings , and some young people just became members of this events .i remembered seeing the rescue the people in destruction by tunami in the east-south asia in 2004 , there are many scenes that young people from various countris went to refuge to help them for living .there is still `` love  in people , especially among young people .and we also see a lot of young people still concern many issues of our globe , like pollution , recycling , and animal protecting , etc .i think that there are still a amont of young people give enough time to really helping their communitis , and we do not know this information just because our medias in many countries does not care about this issue .we can say that medias are almost hold capitalism for their only principle to earn money , so the most attractive news almost about sex , violence , and muder .so we can not just conclude the young people nowadays do nt give enough time to helping their communities .that is i want to say .
