the predictions about future should be well calculated and well designed before being made .from my perspective the prediction about the number of cars in twenty years is just not right and needs to be reviewed in order to make a better projection of the future .the first point that this statement miscalculates is the issue of emerging technologies .as time goes by new technologies come out .this makes people buy new cars in order to keep up with the technology .as an opposition to my point the issue of petrolium might be considered .as an answer to that i guess we shold be looking at the traffic more carefully where we see emerging hybrid cars which consume electricity and gas at the same time .these cars keep the environment clean and attracts the environment concerned people to buy cars .these hybrid cars are being manifactured only one or two companies but others are trying to catch up with better ideas in order to keep the number of sales up .second point that i want to mention is that number of car sales .if we examine them we can obviously see that they are increasing every single day .a proper statistic would show us that it will be that way in the following years .especially when we look back twenty years back from our time there is a considerable amount of increase in the number of cars in use and it looks like it is going to be the same way at least in thirty more years .in the third point i want to be more psychological about the issue by saying that people of the 21st century likes to be mobile more than the people of the past because of the fewer borders between countries .as the world gets more globalized people tend to move more in order to see diffrent places and understand diffrent ideas .one of the means of getting to new places is by cars .the opposition of this idea is the use of public transportation on the other hand people like to be more private so they will be prefering cars .another psychological drive is the joy of driving cars , i do not think driving a car is a fag which passes away after some time as a conclusion the number of cars in use will be increasing untill at least thirty or forty years .new alternatives are being worked on but we should consider the implementation of cars to our lives and compare it to the new technology .that way we can understand the inappropriate part of the subject .
