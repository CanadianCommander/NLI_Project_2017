in my opinion , in education , in order to fully understand and deeply explore an issue , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .to begin with , learning facts , although important , is not sufficent for a student to develop a complete understanding of the subject .it is not possible to evaluate the facts without grasping the underlying idea .the knowledge of the facts without knowing what caused them and why is hard to be considered whole .secondly , without understanding the ideas and the concepts , the student will fail to apply the knowledge he or she has gained to changing facts .as long as the main idea is understood , the student will not struggle even if he or she faces a problem with different facts .lastly , the facts learned as a student can be easily forgotten following the end of the education .however , if one understands the key ideas and concepts , these will guide him or her to recall the information he/she gained during education .exploring ideas and concepts will enable one to develop a strong notion of the subject studied , which is what makes one a successful professional .in conclusion , as a lawyer who always has to be guided by main ideas and concepts in the face of unique facts of each event , i believe that , for a student , understading ideas and concepts is the most important part of the education .
