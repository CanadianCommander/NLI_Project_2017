from my point of view it s better to have a good knowledge of the academic subjects in some specific profession and , inside this profession , is good to specialize in one particular subject .so , as usual in live , the radical position are not always the right way to choose .to explain my point let me define a basic framework .you have a set of professions , fo example , economics , law , art , etc. and inside one profession set you have some specialize fields , for example , inside economics you have microeconomics and macroeconomics .finally , inside a specialization field you have specific subjects , for example , inside the microeconomic field you have , consumer s behavior or firm s behavior .in that sense , you have to choose a profession according your personnal skills .once you choose your profession you have to know , al least in general , all the aspects inside it .because the specific subject you choose always deals with others general topics .for example , if you choose economics and specifically microeconomics , you have to know some statistical techniques .finally , of course , you choose a specific subject .there s an advantage in choosing and specific subject because you can profundize some subject and studied it better .eventually you can do some interesting contributing to the theory and became a reference research .however , my points deals with the perception of live .if your only objetice in live is to get some money to pay the bills , maybe it s a good path `` know some of all  , so you will never get unnployeed .but i think , even with this point of view , you can have more opporunities if you specialized in one subject , due a few persons could do your work .
