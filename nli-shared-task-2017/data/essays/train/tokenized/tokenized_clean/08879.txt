i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because i think that the definition of `` enjoying life  is very subjective and changes during life .at first let me talk about the subjectiveness of enjoying life .there are so many different kinds of people all over the world .enjoying life can mean to have a great job and a carrier rising up .but there are also people who think that nobody can enjoy life while working .another example are children .on the one hand there are couples who never want to have children , on the other hand a family can consist of the parents and five children and everybody is glad to live within such a big family .what i wanted to say is , that enjoying life can not be putted into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition .another point is , that certain feelings or activities which could be defined as part of a joyful life , change during life .young people who are going to school or university like parties and dancing and most of them doing a lot of sports .they have hobbies and activities they are participating in and friends they meet with .these things help them to enjoy their lifes .older people for example between seventy and eighty years enjoy their lifes in a different way .they are glad if everybody is healthy , they maybe like watching television and drinking a glass of wine in the evening .what i wanted to point out is that people enjoy their lifes in many different way .what way it is depends on their personality and their age .that is why i disagree with the statement .i do not think that young people are happier than older ones .they are only enjoying life in a different way .
