i believe that both things are necessary .this is a great question and also it could be a big dilemma .based on my own experience is how i reach this conclusion .nowadays i am dentist , but i just got my degree five months ago .while i was still in my fourth year of university , i came up with the same question .i was a very good student with high grades , but all i could talk to people about was teeth and the oral cavity .i even used to say , as a joke , that i had tooth-shaped brain !i felt really bad about my reality so i looked forward to find an extracurricular activity that had nothing to do with dentistry .thus i registered myself for the selection of the universidad central de venezuela in the world model of the united nations ( worldmun ) .worldmun is an event organized by harvard university with the purpose of gathering students from universities from all over the world , in order to discuss the current agenda of the un ; in other words , students play the role of diplomatics that defend the position of certain country , regarding an especific topic of real life .i have to admit that it was quiet hard for me because the training process implied to study and know many things about general culture , universal history and current world events , and those where subjects i was not familiar with at all .but after a huge effort , i finally got to go to beijing , china in march of this year , with 28 other ucv students .the team got the first prize among more than 200 other universities from around the world .that does not mean that i am not interested anymore in getting an specialization of my career .on the contrary `` i want  now to do an oral and maxillo-facial surgery specialization .so my conclusion is that someone does not need to be completely in favor of one option , i believe that one person can manage him or herself to have knowledge in many academic subjects , but at the same time , he or she can have a specialization .the mind has no limits , you put the limits !
