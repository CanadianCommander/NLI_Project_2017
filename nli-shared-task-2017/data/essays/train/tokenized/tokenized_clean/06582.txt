the issue states that there would be fewer cars than there are todayin twenty years .i do not agre with this statement , moreover i feel that the use of cars would be doubled in twenty years than they are today .fifteen years ago computers have been rarely found with the software industies and only with the managers of various institutions and industries .but now each and every software proffesional , many students shopkeepers of various stores use it .in a similar way the usage of cars also rise since the cars with less costs are also available in the market a person with an average annual income can afford to buy a car for the services rendered by it .a car is used as a luxurious commodity for the modern man .also it can carry many peoplefrom one place to another unlike a motor cycle .cars have been developed to run not only with fuels such as petrol , diesel which pollute the environment heavily but also with the gaseous fuels which are environmental friendly .cars using gaseous fuels are also economical .cars have also the advantage of safety carrying of diseased persons compared to motor cycles .cars have also been designed for a single seater which is more economical .cars using solar radiation as a fuel is under research .such cars would benefit us more .they give us more comfort to sit and even facilities of air conditioning are possible in it .everybody is now used to such luxurious comforts .so people work hard to make themselves more comfortable and make his travelling easyby adopting a driver to the car where as this facility is not available with other vehicles .though buses have this facility , they may not be readily available in need of time .so in order to save most of them prefer cars .people have the idea of deciding what is right or what not .they know how well a car would benefit them .many of them instead of preferring a motor cycle wait for some more timeand then have a car .so i feel that cars use would be doubled in twenty years and not reduced .
