i am agree with the statement of young people s not giving enough time to helping their communities .it is my belief that , there are several reasons that cause this situation .but , not only the young people , but also the environmental situations are the reasons of this problem .this problem may be first explained by the changes in the young people .it is my belief that we are getting more selfish from generation to generation and starting to think only ourselves .a few years ago , when our country is in a difficult situation , everyone has the concious to do something for his/her country , but now we only think about what can we do for saving ourselves .one of the causes of this problem is the concious that is given to the young people in their home , by their parents .the most important place where a person learns most of the things that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home .in the older times , parents are more careful about this situation , but as the time passes , as the problems of the parents increase about their children , giving community concious is not anymore an important problem for the family .another place , that the young people are educated is school .at school , the teachers are the people who is responsible for teaching the importance of the community and helping to these children .teachers should give the concious , explain the good ways of helping the community and describe the positive things that they will gain by helping the community to the students .for example the teachers should explain the difficulties that the people have who have mental disordinarities to his/her students .by this way he/she can affect the students and cause them to want to help that people .we should start thinking about our community again and trying for someone else .helping someone else makes the people feel proud of him/herself and cause to feel good .if we do not help our community , we can not expect something from our community .we should think our expectations , other people s expectations and behave according to this .we should also help the next generation to gain this concious again .
