i agree with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .a person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go , a person can learn a lot of things by having the tour guides explain , and the travel will be much safer .first of all , a person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go .the tour guides are professionals .they earn money from guiding tourists .of course , they know the land better than the tourists .there is no need to worry about getting lost or going to the wrong place .also , a person does not have to think about where he should go each day .the tour guides know where the best places are for people to go in the amount of time they have .fun is guranteed .second of all , the tour guides can give a person an excellent explanations and some tips that he should know .it is always fun to know mini trivias .for example , when my family and i went to cancun , we visited a famous historical landscape in a tour .our tour guide made our trip much more exciting by adding trivias and funny stories behind the history .usually , i do not really like learning about history , but i really liked what i have experienced .i also learned a lot from it .by just looking at the buidings , i would not have learned much information , just only the basic facts .yet , by having a tour guide explain things , i could understand better and was more interesting .finally , the trip would be much safer when someone is going on a trip in a group .people might try to steal money or trick that person if he was alone .he might not even notice it .however , if a person is in a group , someone in the group is likely to notice that people are trying to trick the person .it is harder to trick twenty people rather than just tricking one person .thus , it is safer .to conclude , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .a person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go , a person can learn a lot of things by having the tour guides explain , and the travel will be much safer .
