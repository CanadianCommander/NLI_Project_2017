everyone loves to want be successful people .that is why there is a big debate about wether people can get success things .naturally , some people feel that we try new things and take riske .however , in my opinions , doing what they already know how to do well is necessary .there are a few reasons why i hold this view .to begin with , it is professional .what i mean is that they konw very well compare the other persons .for exampel , if cardiologist want to take care of pediatric patients , is it a good way ?as you can see , when they want to success their works or job , they have to do what they already know how to do well .another thing , we must considers effective factors .in other words , when someone try new things , it is time-consuming .take divers as an example .if tax drivers try drive buses or truck , they have to learn how to do it .also , they have to get this licences .they aleady have know-how .they already know how to do well therefore essential for success .taking a look at the other perspective , of course may people consider refresh and change their mind .that is to say , when people can do work for a long time , they can get manersim .however , if they give motivation or change life style , you can get more adventages .thus , we must do waht we know how to do well .taking all things into considerations , i feel strongly that only doing what they know how to do well is a great idea .the main reasions are professional and effective .do you still think that successful people try new things and take risks ?
