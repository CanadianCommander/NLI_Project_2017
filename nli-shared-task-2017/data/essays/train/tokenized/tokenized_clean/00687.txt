the question being asked is if traveling in a group with a tour guide is a best type of tour .this issue is important because it has several implications on which type of travel people should have .i believe that traveling in a group with a guide is not always good .one reason i believe this is that people have different preferences .in a group tour , each person needs to follow the group s plan even though the plan does not care of what he or she wants .while traveling around france , for example , artists want to visit museums but cooks want to go to fine restaurants .in a group tour , it is very difficult to satisfy the wishes of every member in the group .another reason i do not think that a group tour is best is that people do not have time enough to do what they really like to do in a group tour .the itinerary of a group tour can not be flexible very much .the guide and tourists need to adhere to the existing plan .while traveling , if you find a fascinating place , you would want to stay for a day or two .in a group tour , it is almost impossible to change the plan .this could reduce the true value of traveling .finally , i am not a proponent of a group tour because people could lose wonderful opportunities to see and make friends with the people who live in other places .when you travel on your own , you tend to try to understand the town and its people that you visit .in a group tour , you may be too busy to do this , following the group s plan .traveling alone is very good more often than not .in conclusion , i do not agree that a group tour led by a guide is the best way to travel .that is becasue a group tour has its own shortcoming .furthermore , i think that traveling alone is quite a good experience .
