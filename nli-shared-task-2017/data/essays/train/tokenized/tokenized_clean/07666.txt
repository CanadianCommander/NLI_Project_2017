many people say that we need to study a lot of subjects when we are high school students .actually , when i was a student , i could nt understand why i have to study everything .i wanted to study just i love it .however , i really think that study many academic subjects are important than just one specific subject after i became adult .there are two specific reasons why i think so .at first , we need to have knowledge of peoples studies since humans appeared many many years ago as a human being .when humans just borned in antient times , there were nt anything but people studied themself and inovent many things so we are now .we need to study their history to study like mass , language , chemistory and so on .then , if we study many academic subjects , students know that which one is so interested in them .it s most important thing .for school is providing many subjects , students can learn new categories of study .it s good experiences for them .after that , they can decide which one is really good for them and it s good oppotunity for find their mejor in univercity and job in the future .in conclusion , if people study just a specific subject , it s perhaps better .she or he could be expart in the future at the specific subject .however , when we study many things , we can know a lot of knowledge .it s not only their job but also use these skills for many social situations .i really think that it s necessary to study many academic subjects for improving our sociaty and ideas .
