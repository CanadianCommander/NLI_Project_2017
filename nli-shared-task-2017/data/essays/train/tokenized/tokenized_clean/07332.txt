some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideaas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .others do not think so .in my opinion , i prefer the first one because the goals of studing is to how to use the knowledge .for high school and college students , it is important to understand the ideas of the courses .if you just can remerber some facts and can not know the reasons , then you will not deep understand the main purposes and some implied meading behind the facts .usually , this is essential for studing the article or reserching some science experiments .for example , iwhen you learn some history episode , the more you can learn background , the more understanding you learn the content .in addition , you will be flexable to apply your knowledge to what you need if you understand the course .forexample , in the exam , if the teachear give some questions on the exam paper different from the content in the class , but you still can deal with it if you really understand the content but not just depending your rememory .on the other hand , learning is for practising .when you grasp some knowledge and can use it to deal with problems , in this way you can be competent in the job market in the future .of course , learning facts is very nessessary for the students especially for the primary students .young childern must learn some primary knowlege that is helpful to them .to sum up ,
