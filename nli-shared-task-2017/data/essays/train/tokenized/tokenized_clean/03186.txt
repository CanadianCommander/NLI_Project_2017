`` jack of all but master of none  is the saying that is used to convey the meaning of the statement .i do agree that we go to have a knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one .the reason for this is the current world needs flexibility i.e it not necessary that you master a single subject but you must know the concepts of different subjects .moreover there is no subject that is self contained , every subject has got some co-relation with others forexample physics has got maths into it biology has got physics principles into it so are the others .a student needs to be well verse with the basics of many subjects , for the practical problems that he faces are not confined to a single subject .what would be the use if you master physics principles and can not solve a practical physics problem given with equations ?thats where you got to to apply maths .the child would observe his surroundings in a broader perspective if he is exposed to different subjects .he can understand every law that governs different situations in this world .broad knowledge on all the subjects would give a wide scope of building up intrest while specialization would be rather boring to study .as flexibility is needed to survive in this world we must have a broad knowledge of subjects because if there arises a situation where the principle of the subject you master fail so its mandatory that you make a transition .if you lack knowledge on other subjects then you would perish in the situation .aother practical example is a child who has mastered in computer science would confine himself to the computer there would be no other world beyond it .if the computer crashes down due to some faliure for instance due to power faliure in his house he would have no other option to call up the board to rectify the minor problem .in contrast if he has got the knowledge about electrical principles he would be rectifying it all by himself there by saving his money and time .this is the reason why educational institutions have been teaching their students various subjects so as to have an all round development in different fields of the student .
