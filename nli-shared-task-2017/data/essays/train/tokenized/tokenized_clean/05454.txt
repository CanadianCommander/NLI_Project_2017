it is a controversial issue whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject .depending on personal experience or pesonality type , some will support the former one , while others will choose the later one .but it is too absolute to say that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject .in short , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects has countless advantages , otherwise , to specialize in one specific subject has a great number of advantages too .as far as i am concerned , to have broad knowledge of many academic can help you to have a more colorful life than the to specialize in mere one specific subject .some people do not like to focus on one single subject for it is too boring for them to learn due to their own personalities .futhermore , to have broad knowledge is the significant skill because all the things are related .it is much easier for the people to deal with the things in other fields of areas .maybe it will help the people to earn more money .though to have broad knowledge has the many advantages , to specialize in one specific subject also has great advantages .if people specialize in one specific subject , he or she can learn more about the knowledge and have deeper understanding of the subjects he or she concentrates on .there is no doult it will help the people to get a good job in their areas .in my point of veiw , either to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject should be according to the personalities of different people .if you can enjoy yourselve in either , this will be the perfect choise you make .
