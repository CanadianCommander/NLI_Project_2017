i do nt agree with this statement .i d like to explain why i think so .there are three reasons .first , the number of human beings will inclease in this twenty years .now , there are about 6,000 million human beings in the earth , and it is incleasing , especially in china , india , and so on .and these countries are the good markets of the car .second , the car will become more typical way of moving , because typically , the countries in which the number of human beings will inclease have very wide country area , like china .so , they will want to use car for moving .lastly , the car will become more personal item of moving .currently , typical style of owning the car is that a family or a company owns the car .the reason of this is economical reason .the price of car is very expensive , so we must share a car with some people .because there will be the cost reduction by the production technology s advent in recent years , the car price will be down .in this situation , the style of owning the car is change to the style of per person .because of these three reasons , i think that the number of cars will inclease in twenty years .
