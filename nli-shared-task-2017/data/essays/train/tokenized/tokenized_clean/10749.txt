over the past decades , atmosphere pollution has become a major issue for the international community , as the signing of the kyoto protocol , ment to reduce toxic gases production , in 1992 showed it .cars contribute to such a pollution , and therefore it is essential for the future of men to stop using them .but yet , it does nt seem to me that neither politicians nor people are ready to get rid of cars in a period of time of twenty years .first and foremost , it is clear that in developped countries , where most of the cars are used nowadays , politicians are not willing to implement policies that would force citizens to get rid of their cars .in the most powerful of these countries , the usa , the current administration does nt even consider atmospher pollution to be a problem to tackle .it will therefore certainly take more than twenty years before something is done about this .in other countries , if politicians acknowledge cars contribute to pollute the air , they prefer protecting the car industry whether than taking measures to restrict their use .only london and stockholm have restricted the access to car in their historical centres .and as infrastructures that could replace the use of cars are missing , people are nt ready to get rid of them besides , the emerging countries  will to benefit of cars has to be taken into account .for the good of their economies , they can not restrict the developpement of the car industry , and they also want to benefit from the best way of life .they will therefore certainly not forbid people to use cars .all in all , considering the economic context , the current policies implemented at all levels to reduce the use of cars and the people s will to do so , there is no doubt that there will not be fewer cars than there are today .i m affraid there will even be more of them .
