i completely disagree with the statement that , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the first reason for my belief is , if any company or industry make any false statement about their product , they will be in loss not only with that particular product even for their entire life time .next time if they come up with really good product and they start adverising in the tv and in newspapers , but no body is going to buy it , as they already have very bad impression about their earlier product .so gaining confidence of the customer is very important for profits .so when they advertise about the product they should not lie about the product consequently the product or particular company will build a good rapport with the customers .the second reason for my belief is , not all the companies will cheat the customers .to have good reputation the company should not expect the profits initially , first they should be humble with the customer and try to improve the marketing of their product .for example take johnson and johnson companies products , initially they tried not to exaggerate about their product or not to lie about the product , they created some sort of trust in their customers .so as they come up with new products some times they do nt even have to advertise their product , just by looking at their company name cutomer will buy the product .thirdly , there are few products which will be given over impression as they really are .but it should be healthy it should not be something which plays with customer life .some products will sell fast just the way they advertise the product .for example some clothing advertisement , they can give any type of advertisement because it is not going to have any kind of life threatenings , the same thing if they do in some medication which has really bad side effects and still if they do false advertisement that is not healthy .advertisemant plays very important role in competing with the other products , the competition should be healthy way , it should not be unhealthy , by false advertisements the companies not only get loss but also never can be good reputitive company or product , even they come up with real good product .above mentioned reasons will support my disagreement with the statement given `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .
