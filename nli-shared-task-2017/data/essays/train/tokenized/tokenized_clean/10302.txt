as far as concerned , i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .maybe it could happen in far future but in twenty years there will be more cars that are more developed .there are several reasons of my thought .first of all , cars are comfortable and fast tranformation .it enables you to get any place that has ground .when i was a high-school student i often late in class because there were lots of homework to do and the class started early in the morning .so my mother gave me ride to school so that i would not late in class .next , cars are useful to move havey things better than a person .my parents did not have a car just after our family moved to us from south korea .we had to go shoopping to buy some food and furniture and other things .we had so many things to buy but we did nt have any transpormation to get to the mall and bring those all stuffs .there was no other transpormation except individual car to get to the store .so we had to borrow a car from the next door that we never met .it was really a embarass experience .in my oppinion , there will be cars just as it is today .
