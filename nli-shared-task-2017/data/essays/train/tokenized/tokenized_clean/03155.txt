there is an arguement concerning whether it is beneficial for people to have broad knowledge of many fields or to specialize in one particular subject .although it is true that one specific knowledge can be more efficient , i believe that broad knowledge has many advantages .in this essay , i will briefly two reasons supporting my idea .most of all , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can study their own fields .in particular , in the science research , scientist who have a variety of knowledge can be obtain ideas about his research from different subjects .for example , i read an article of one physicist whom i do not remember his name .he said that he often gain his ideas about physics research from literature .besides , the paradigm of subject are shifted in 21st centry .in 21th centry , many subjects are combined with other subjects which are not related them .for instance , physicist can adjust his knowledge to the medical science or biology , and economist can use scientific methods to analize economic materials .in this respect , knowing many academic subjects have many benefits to study .moreover , having broad knowledge can make life more plentiful .particularly , person who have many academic subjects can talk and discuss with people who have different jobs or major .therefore , he can enjoy various kinds of subjects and make friends who is in different field .this make his life more exciting and plentiful .besides , people who have different subjects with their major can applicate this knowledge his level of living better .for example , my uncle is professor of biology but he also knows well about economy .he adjust his knowledge about economy to invest stock , and he earn mucy money .in conclusion , having a wide range of knowledge is better on account of reasons that i mentioned above : various knowledge can contribute to not only the reseach and study in many fields , but also make more plentiful life .
