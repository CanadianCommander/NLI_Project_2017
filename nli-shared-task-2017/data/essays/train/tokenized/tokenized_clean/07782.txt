in fact , i disagree with the statement .why ?because the internet .when the internet have nt been built , there are more interaction between people .so you can see many young people in their community to care about the community .the internet is so popular nowadays , those young people in public occasion might disappear , but they have been using their way to take care of the community .for example , young people can set up the community in the internet .if the residents in the community have some issue to discuss , they can enter the visual community to change their information or give advices .communicating by the internet is faster and more powerful than the traditional face-to-face method .everyone in the community has access to the informaion immediately after these information was post in the community of the internet .and they can react it right away .the government can know the informaion sooner than before and they can adjust the policy about the city .moreover , young people do not always sit in front of the computer .in my community , many young people volunteer to help the elderly people in the community .i , for instance , make a routine to clean the house beloning to theelderly people whose child are far away the community .sometimes , i also serve as the tutor of the orphans in the orphanage .my neighbor , james , also do the same thing with me and we all feel satisfied after helping others .of course , there are many young people like us in our community .based on the preceding points i made , i can conclude that the new generation does help their community both viturall and pratically .
