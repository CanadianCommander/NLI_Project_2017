if you only do what you already know how to do well , you would definitely be good at what you are doing .but to achieve success or victory , you need more than that .it is quite impossible to say that success comes without any pain .in order to be successful at one thing , you should accept to take risks .that s why in my opinion successful people are those who dare to take risks .we can see a lot of examples in the history showing that successful people always take risks .for example during second world war , churchill made a very risky plan and ordered to all allied forces for a surprise attack .if his plan was unsuccessful , it would have led to the victory of hitler over the world .but churchill made it and became victorious , that victory also made him one of the most successful stateman of the history .the essential point in his victory was the courage to take a risk .we can also state that in business , rich and successfull people are always the ones who took a lot of risk in their lives .the famous deed collector donald trump is a recent example of success .after his bankrupt several years ago , he did not stop working , in contrast he took more risks to build up his empire again .and finally he became very rich again , that was his success by taking risks .furthermore , taking risks and trying new things are not only a way to success but also a crucial step for self improvement .people can gain more life experience by taking risks and trying new things .on the other hand those who choose to do only what they know to do and nothing more , can not go further and be successful .finally , i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks because as they say `` no pain , no gain  .
