it is important for everyone to have not only the substract ability but also the objective ability .substract ability is based on the understanding of ideas and concepts , and the objective ability is based on the facts .based on the researchs , kids and children are sensitive to the facts because they have not the capicity to think and solve the complex questions .on the other hand , adults and elder youth are more willing to understand ideas and concepts because they have the ability to think substract things .for example , in math , a child can only understand the simple calculte steps , but for adults or youth , they can solve complex question step by step .as a result , i disagree the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .in my opnion , everything is based the facts , without the facts , any ideas and concepts are vanity .for a elementary school student , it impossible to catch the ideas and concepts .
