considering the fact that driving a car is getting the most stressful and exaggerating way to get from one place to the other because of the huge number of cars on our streets that produce traffic jams of intolarable length , i think it is without question that we should have fewer cars not only in twenty years but soon .the other possiple solution to build more and broader roads is improper due to environmental reasons .the debate taking place about climate change and the convincing arguments scholars are giving us for the fact that , if we go on emissing such large ammounts of co2 , we are going to face a serious climate catastrophe , shows that we are forced to think of alternatives to the nowadays used cars .but i do not think personal transpotation systems in some other way will still be in use in twenty years .i hope that by then we will be able to use a type of energy that on the one hand does not pollute the air and on the other hand is regrowing .i am of the conviction that fossile energy is not a technique of the future .an other point i would like to discuss is the question if people could live without cars , maybe even should .taking into consideration the millions of people killed in car accident i come to the conclusion that we should use a safer transportation system like trains .of course we face the disadvantage that a given person is way more flexible when taking the car than when taking the train or other public transportation systems .i would recomment an improvement in these systems , for example a better network and more trains , in order to make the use of safer techniques more attractive .coming to an end i would like to again express my hope , that at some point in time we will be independend from cars as we now know them with their noise , smell and negative consequenses on the environment and our health .
