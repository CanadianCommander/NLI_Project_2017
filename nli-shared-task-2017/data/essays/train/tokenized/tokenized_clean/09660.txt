knowlegde it s a basic concept in our lives ; since we are judged by our lever of knowledge .there are many opinions on what we should have as a north .i think tha we should specialize in one specific subject .i am a political science student .plato or aristotle would say that a person must have a specfict field of specialization because no one could be an expert on two or more subjects .at least , that was what a learn on my classic political thought theory class .i think that if you have a broad knowledge of many academis subjetcs you are not going to be good , or excellent at any of those .a person can not be capable of being an expert on different topics or field .if he or she wants to be good at something he or she must choose a specific field .i support my opinion because a person might have specifics concerns so he/shecan conduct specific researches on specific topics .a person might never have a lot of concerns on different topics because it will be too abstract on everything .a concentration on different topics will get the researchers confunsed on what they should follow .a professionalt must folow just a direction .he or she must specialized in her or his field in order to be excellent on that field .that is my phylosophy .
