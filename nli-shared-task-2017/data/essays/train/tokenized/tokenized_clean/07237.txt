some people think that to learn facts is more important than to understand ideas and concepts because facts make students easy to decide something to do .but personally , i think that there are a lot of factors when students decide something to do therefore , i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , it is sometimes difficult for university students to enter a certain company .for example , i worked at ntt , the biggest telecommunication company in japan .when i was a university student , ntt was a top ranked company in japan and very difficult to enter .many friends of mine gave up trying to enter that company only because of the difficulty .if i just cared about the fact that the company is very difficult to enter , i might not try to enter that company .but i had a huge dream that i wanted to change the world by using the internet , and at that time ntt was the most powerful it company in japan .i just believed my idea and entered the company .this example clearly shows that ideas is more important than facts .second of all , it is hard to get a scholarship .for instance , i got a scholarship in my high school days .my high school was very famous and one of the highest level in my region .when i decided to challenge to get a scholarship , all teachers in my junior high school told me it was impossible .however , i never gave up my concept that i got a scholarship and made my parents less burden .if i followed the fact that it was hard to get a scholarship , i never got a scholarship from my high school .this example is the typical case that to understand ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts .in conclusion , i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
