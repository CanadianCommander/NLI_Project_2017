in my opinion it is better to have a broader knowledge of many academic subjects .in today s world , no subject can be studied in isolation .subjects are linked to each other .for a good understanding of one subject , some amount of knowledge of a related subject is essential .for example , for studying complex genetic engineering , a knowledge of computers is required for studying models .similarly , while studying history of a particular region at a certain time , it is beneficial to know the economics of that area at that time .it would help us better understand the events occuring at that time and the reasons behind them .thus , as subjects are inter-related we need to have knowledge of many subjects .we also need to understand things happening around us .things happening around us are also related .to understand issues like why did the iraq war occur , we need to understand politics and history .to be aware of why and when tsunamis or hurricanes occur , we need to know geography .if we catch cold , then we need to know why it happened and how we can prevent it .so we need to expand our horizon of knowledge to include many subjects to increase our awareness .does this mean that we dont need specialists ?specialists are required as there are many areas which require a detailed and thorough study which specialists have done .for research in particular fields specialists are required .in my opinion , the number of subjects to be studied should vary according to the level of education .primary and secondary education should focus on a variety of subjects as they are the building blocks of a student s knowledge base .higher education can be focussed at a specific subject .thus , a broad knowledge of numerous academic subjects is essential at the primary and secondary level of education .
