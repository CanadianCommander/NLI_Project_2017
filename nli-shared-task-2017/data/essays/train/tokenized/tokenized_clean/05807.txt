i agree the idea that more important thing for students is to understand ideas and concepts .the first reason is that if the students can understand and follow the whole ideas or concepts of one thoery , it makes easilier to learn facts .for example , imagine that you have to learn the history of the 1960 .if you learn a lot of facts related to the 1960 .in 1960 , there are enormous events and many detailed things you have to remember .at first , you can remember the specific things what you think significant thing , but you forget most of facts you learned the next day .however , if you study the whole structure of the history in 1960 and then add the detailed facts and organize well , you can remember facts easily than just learning facts without understanding concepts and even you can understand the flow of the history in 1960 without any extra affort .furthermore , if you understand the entire ideas and concepts , it helps you can solve the questions on your midterm or final exam .thus , it gives the opportunities to understand another historical facts .most of the facts have connection with each other .for example , you already studied some historical facts in 1960 .there are some facts which have relation with the other historical facts something like some events in 1980 .if you know the entire concepts of 1960s history , you can learn additional facts related to another historical times .the last reason , i agree the idea that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .is it is the true that you ca nt understand , learn and remember all of the facts what you need .for instance , i have a test tomorrow and the test is for types of arts .it means , i have to memorize lots of types of arts including realitism , romanticism .if i did nt know the concepts of the romanticism , but i have to memorize the facts of the romanticism .so i start to memorize everything in the art of remanticism including the pictures , history , artists .evenif i spend one week to prepare my test , i ca nt remember everything about romanticism .there are a lot of facts in romanticism , and it is impossible to memorize or even understand without understanding the ideas and concepts .the facts is small things in one theory .if you want to draw and see the whole picture of one theory , you have to understand ideas and concepts before you learn the facts .understanding ideas and concepts is the most important and basic step to learn facts .
