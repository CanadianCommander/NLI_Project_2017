there is a general notion among the older generation that today s youth are irresponsible and are not socially concious .they feel that young people do not care about their communities or their nation as a whole .i disagree .true , the older generation can proudly boast of all the help that they have done to their communities and their nation .take the case of the fight for indian independence in the first half of the 20th century .the youth at that time were very social concious .they were passionate about their country and involved themselves in various freedom movements .some of them were ready to die fighting for their country , such was their vigour and devotion towards their country .similar cases can be seen throughout the world at that time when the world was undergoing a change with two world wars and decolonilisation taking place .but in no way can the older generation assert that the younger generation do not give enough time to help their communities .today s youth may not have the social and political awareness that their parents and grand parents have , but it is incorrect to see today s youth as irresponsible and bound by consumerism .young people are wrongly accused of having a do nt - care attitude towards their communities .there are many instances that overturn this notion .for example , in my colony , it is the young people who organize festivals and programs to celebrate and rejoice with their community as a whole .i can often see college going students give lifts to old people who are too old to travel in public transportation , in their vehicles .the recent bollywood movie ` rang de basanti  depicts four young men who eliminate a corrupt politician for the good of the society .therefore , it is wrong to believe that young people only think about where their next date will be or when they will see their next movie .they are very respnsible towards their society .
