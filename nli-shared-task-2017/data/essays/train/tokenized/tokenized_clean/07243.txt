the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  , is partly true .the things they present in magazines and on television are always presented very well , not showing a single flaw of the product. a product that is often presented better in advertisements than it actually is , is food. a lot of companies , such as burger king , wendy s , or subway , always present they food products very well .the burger that we might see on television or in a magazine looks delicious , with its meet grilled to perfection , and the grisp `` homegrown  tomatoes , the freshly baked bread .but when actually having bought and tasted the product , the customer might experience a suprise and a dissappointment .the so delicious , golden fries seen on television , might actually be pale , potato stumps , fried to almost perfection in very very very old oil .the burger , so tasty looking in the magazine , might in reality embody a piece of grey old meat , between 2 almost fresh tasting pieces of bread .make-up for example is always presented very well in commercials on tv or in magazines .the skin of the model looks super soft and pure , the lashes so full and long , the lips perfectely shaped and full .but what most of the buyers do nt know , is the way a picture and the model are prepared before displayed in a magazxine or shown on television .the lashes are fake , the lips are reshaped with the help of of photoshop , and the skin purified with tones of thick make-up and powder .the result of super volume mascara in reality is most often very disappointing , and instead of having those sexy long lashes , one finds herself having short clumpy lashes .nevertheless , those are just some examples that appear to be high quality products , but the crucial fact is that the buyer has the choice whether to believe the incrediable presentatiopn of the product and thus buy it , or not to believe it and not buy it .the problem that arises is that one can never be sure of what he or she is buying , because one will always be affected by the inevitable laws of money making , and the price a customer has to pay for it .i believe that those are some major flaws that influence our lives greatly , but i also believe that we , the buyers , can not do anything about it .we as customers simply have to accept that we either have to pay an incrediable amount of money or to pay for less quality cheap products .
