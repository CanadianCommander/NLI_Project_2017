i agree with this statement .in fact a lot of products are quite different from the examples given in their own advertisements .i mean that people , who study the way to present an article or a product and finnally to prepare an advertisment , wants to attract the attention of the costumer , instead of describes the qualities of the product .using this kind of technique , the advertiser risk to have a product different in quality respect to the one , the customer have in mind .for example , i have buied a toothpasta that say to radically transorm my smile in a whiter smile , but after the four weeks that the advertisment suggest to use this product my smile was not so different .in my opinion the advertiser want to demontsrate that his product is the best , or is better than others .in some cases , to do this , he decide to say something not complitely true or not at all possible in order to attract the attention of the people .he lies a little , but he may pose his attention on the indefinite line , that divide people who believe in his advertisment and people who do nt .in particular people who believe in the advertisement do nt accept to discover that the product is very different from his idea .in conclusion in my opinion is not always a good idea to lie or to present products better then they are , because the custumer want what the advertisement says and do nt want a bad surprise .
