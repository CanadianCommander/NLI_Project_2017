as a student i suppose that it is much useful to understand and learn ideas and to demonstrate on the ideas .i believe the most important thing that shows if the student understood and learned something is that if a student can put his thought to the thing he learned .the education i am having now also teaches me how to think and how to express my thoughts on certain topics and fact .the most certain example is when a student can express his or her opinion on history ; because history had happened in past and a student can change the history by his/her thoughts .for example if a war is lost and we know how it s lost , a student can think of what he would do if it was him and how his movement towards things would be in that moment .if a student can express his thoughts of movement to somebody else i would believe that a student not just learned the facts also understood what happened in the past .he also learned it and would never forget it because he actually lived those moments in his mind .this is very important in understanding ideas or things happen .student must be interrfierd with the topic .another example is that student can learn a bunch formulas in math in a lesson and by using those formulas he can solve every question .but after a while if that student does nt go back and study the formulas he will forget them .what happened is student leanred the formulas at that moment but he actually did nt understand them .so learning also becomes with going back and studying the things that are learned .revision is very important in a students life .in our country most people work before 2 days from the exam and they memorize everything then they get an `` a  on the exam .but after graduation there is this big exam oss and they ca nt memorize everything because they are judged on what they have learned in the past 5 years so they fail from oss and they ca nt go to a university .what happens to the things they understood at the time does nt become useful in their future and they ca nt be successful because their education did nt make them learned anything .as a matter of fact not only understanding is important , but learning and understanding is much more improtant than only understanding .
