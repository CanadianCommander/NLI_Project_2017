i do not concur with the statement .i believe that the old people enjoy life more than the young .the defination of enjoyment is important in this case .enjoyment is being stable , happy , doing the right things , being liked and to be in a balance state of mind .this qualities are abundant in the old .the young are in the illusion that enjoying life is going to parties , bunking classes , neglecting studies etc .but this is not enjoyment but mere pleasures achevied preceived to be enjoyment .the old have there own ways of enjoying life .for them going for a walk in the morning , following strict diets and having discussions is a form of enjoying life .this kind of enjoyments are good for the person concerned in the long run and can be considered as enjoying life .for example a young person drives fast and considers to be enjoying himself but there are more chances of him meeting with an accident whereas a old person drives slowly but still enjoys his drive and reaches his destination safely .now if you think from the teen perspective he is enjoying and also from the old he is enjoying too but the enjoyment of life is defined by the old who is safe and good .the conclusion of the discussion is that both the young and the old enjoy life .the young might have more fun and enjoyment but the young s idea of enjoyment is false .the old might have less fun and frolic but his idea of enjoyment is true and clearly defines the idea of enjoying life .this way there is a strong contention for old people enjoying more life based on the defination of enjoyment in life mentioned above .
