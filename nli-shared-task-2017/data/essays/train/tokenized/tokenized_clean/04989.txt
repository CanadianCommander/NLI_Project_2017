i dont agree at all that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .of course , technology may distract young people and may let them very occupied , but it is not necessary that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .if you look around you and you see the developed projects , it is because of young people and i consider these developments as a help to communities .i think that helpness is not only substancial or tactile thing , i mean that you can also help your community by loving them and giving them a lot of passion .i am a big example to prove that young people are helpful to community .i am eighteen years old and i am in a medicin college .i have alot of subjects to study and a lot of work to do but i work as a volenteer in an orpahange in my country every weekend and every summer holiday .in addition , i think it is a big help if young poeple help their communities but they do not give enough time for this helping , i mean that ther are at least help .for example , my cousin is fond of internet , she is always setting 24 hours on the computer and searching on the internet and chatting and having a lot of fun , although , she rarely do a benefit web sites which help people in different fields , and because she seldom helps people , i think she is a very helpful person .in conclusion , the more young people give enough time to helping communities , the more developments we will reach and in my opinion , every young person is welling to help his or her community as much as he or she can .
