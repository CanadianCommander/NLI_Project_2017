we have rights to know and educate the truth occuring in the world .advertisements make products a lot of information through television , radio , newspaper and internet .i do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .some persons who works in the advertisement companies give information to us .they have a focus on the some events , and in detail they give their thoughts and insights .if they all have caught a mistake sensation of the actual events , there is huge problem .however since actually advertisement presents to us after cheking many editors , i believe that overmistaken advertisement will disappear from the advertisements .for getting really advertisements and information , it is necessary to be free in our sociality , education and economy .if we do not have the freedom rights of knowledge , education , speaking and religion , i agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .under the condistion such as no freedom rights , we have possibility which prodcuts seem much better than advertisements really are .for example , the peoples in north korea are blocked from a lot of information of the others  countries .they hear only information which central social committee decides that may advertise for the peoples .however they believe true information because they do not know the information of the others country .in conclusion , when we could have freedom rights , most advertisements make products which they really are .if we could not , most advertisements make products seem much better than they reall are .in united states , since i have freedom rights , i do not agree its sentence .
