in our days , the young people seem to be concerned only by themselfes .between helping their community ortake care about themselfes , their choice is usually the same : do what they enjoy .but people should not sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing ?do not the society provides also this behaviour ?in our days , the society is one of leisure .the most important thing is to have fun when you can do it during the sparetimes .young people live in another world , a world where everithings is possible and where everythings have to be funny .as many adult do , young people do not take care about their environnement and also about the other people .but it is an especially behaviour of young people or it is the most part of the population who do that ?for me the probleme comes from the mentality .they have changed .before we did not refused to help our neighbours and moreover that was perfectly normal .now , if somebody does that , it is like an miracle .why this change ?maybe due to the new dream of the life witch is to know the happiness or maybe it is only a losing of the closness between people hat we had .many possibilities are true but i thing the most importante one is that we changed into a society where we are more lonely and we do not like who we do not know thus , i agree that young people do not give enought time to think about something else than them .although the conditions of living have changed as the mentality , i thinkit will be very harmful to become to individual .
