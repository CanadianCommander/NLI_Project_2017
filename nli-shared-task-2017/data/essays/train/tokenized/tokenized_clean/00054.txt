advertising is one of the best methods of corporations for selling their product and making their profit higher .everyday people watch advertisements through the newspapers , magazies , radios and televisions .however , with some techniques , advertisement makes a product to seem much better than they really are .on televisions , while we are watching a car advertisement , this ` supersonic  car can be driven perfectly at all areas from warmer climates to poles .however , it is sure driving is not the work of car and it mostly depends on the driver .moreover , the car in the advertisement looks bright and very clean .sure it can be clean sometimes , however there is no possibility that a car can be clean at any time in any where .in addition , it is not shining like a sun in realm .one of the differing product is snacks .in an advertisement , when someone opens the pack of a snack , it is perfectly full , the company puts as much as they can to make us happy .but it is also not true , when i open a patatoe chips , i only see a funny quantity of chips and i have to buy more to be satisfied .most funny advertisements are about computers .because of the majority of puplic do not know much about computer based devices , such as microprocessors ; hard disks or monitors , the company shows the product like it is product that came from space age , that product can do whatever the user wants , never fails or never needs any technical knowledge to use .however all computer users know in real world it is impossible , they have lots of problem while working with a computer .in conlusion , advertisements really make people to think them better than they are and the consumer understands the fact about it until the product fails at some point .
