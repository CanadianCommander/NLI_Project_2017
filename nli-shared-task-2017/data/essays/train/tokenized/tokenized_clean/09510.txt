it is a big topic to discuss that let student to understand ideas and concepts are more important or to learn the facts are more important .i think it is more important for students that to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts .we are not machine .student should know what happened , and why it happened .for students to learn something , it is not only tell them the fact .the main point is telling them why .as we know , students have their imagination , they can imagine a lot of stuffs .they have the ability to understand and figure out what will happe next .to tell them the idea can make them keep going , not stop there .for teaching a student , it is important that give them a way to go and to explore , not only give them answer .there is an example .it is said there was a mom , she has two children , she loves them .she gave her first children a lot wood fair to live in the winter , at the same time , she gave her second children a axe to make wood by himself .the first winter past quickly .both of them still alive .the first children did nt do a lot of work but he had a good winter , the second one did a lot work and he had a good winter too .one year past quickly , the winter came again .the first children did nt have enough wood , he used almost of his wood up during the last winter .he died in a cold night .with out fair .the second children used his axe to make wood , he past the winter at last .this story tell us something about to understand idea is more important than to learn the facts .i think it is more important that to understand ideas than it is for them to learn facts .
