when asked about what kind of knowledges is good for a person s life .many people may hold the issue to learn as much as specialized knowledeg in one specific subjuect and think that is a prime argument .but , some people , however , are taking a fresh look at it .as far as i am concered , i agree with that it is better to have broad knowlege of many acadeemic , although there may several merits to specialize in one sepecific subject , for example , more expertized and more deeply knowledge .among countless reasons that influence my opinion , there are three conspipuous aspects mentioned follow .we may look into every possbile reason , however , the foremost one is that a broad knowledge is good for fitting to the developing of the world today .nowadays , people could get as much as informations from many different methods .they should have the ability to be familiar to huge informations and treat them correctly .and if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must owe many different knowledge of a great deal of subjects .also , it may be arbitrary to juge my preference only to use the argument mentioned in the above paragraph .there is another reason that deserves some words here .for individule perspectivity , a broad knowledge will give person more choices for career .they can choose many different areas to develop their own business .and they can use the broad knowledges to help them make more successes and that will be much easier for them to exert the broad knowledge in a whole .last but not the least reason is that the broad knowlege will give person more opportunities to meet different people with different academic backgrouds .they will communicate with them more freely , and may make friends with them that will be good for their future lives and careers .taking into account of all these reasons mentioned above , we may easily reach the conclusion that it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,
