some nights ago i sat on my bed and tried to learn for a very important testpaper i should write the next day .the subject was biology and so i tried just to learn the facts about the different processes in the human organism .but as i wrote the testpaper the next day , i realised that this was no good idea .i could write down what i had learned , but i did not understand anything .all the different processes . ..i had really no clue , because i just knew some simple facts .this has been an silly experience for me because i always did it like that .but today i realised that this is not the way it should be .i am in school to learn something .i want to know and understand what my teacher is telling me .perhaps i would like to explain other students what i have learned or try to help them if they do not understand something .but if i just learn some facts , that will not work .students should really understand some processes , ideas and concepts , because this is what stays in mind .they should learn for their lifetime and not for a 10-minute-test in school .sure there are subjects where learning facts is the easiest way to get good marks .sometimes there is no logical princip for me which i can follow .but i think this is not often in ones life .in this situation it is definetly more important for them to learn some facts than to know nothing .but because i am a student i know that it is most of the time possible to understand the ideas and concepts the teachers try to explain .so my opinion is that many students are too lazy to learn concepts , therefore they learn some facts .the problem is that they forget the facts after a little pause , while if i have understand the main idea i will always remain me at this .students are learning for their lifetime and they should learn effective .what does it help someone if i know the facts of the processe of the photosynthesis for three days , but never realised what importance the photosynthesis has for the humanbeeing ?i am definetly convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
