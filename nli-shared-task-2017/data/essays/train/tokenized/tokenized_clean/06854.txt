successfully completing the tasks of lifein the following i want to take issue on why people wanting to be successful should try new and risky things .where would we be if people wanting to make progress did not affront new challenges ?is confronting yourself with new challenges and unknown tasks not always connected with taking a risk ?so this means , taking risks is what makes people advance and this again i consider as being successfull .experiences like going to a new school , moving in a new apartment and having a new neighbourhood or start a new job or just do some bungee jumping , give the person carrying out the action a new point of view of life .the new living circumstances challenge him to get out of old patterns of behaviour and she/he will start to reflect on his captivites , no matter what captivity it is a social , professional or just a physical one .having this new point of life permits you to enhance your horiyon and allows zou to go steps further .all in all , this means to me going succesfully through life .
