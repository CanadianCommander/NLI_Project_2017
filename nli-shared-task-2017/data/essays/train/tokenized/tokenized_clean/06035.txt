if we happen to consider this issue from an academical point of view , it seems plausible to exemplify it in a classroom environment .say , we have two classes , class a and class b. the kind of education based on facts and the kind of education based on understanding and concept being followed in each , respectively .and let s compare these two environments and the students in each , in terms of motivation , creativity and success .firstly focusing on motivation , let s consider the eve of a certain class .knowing that a certain subject will be covered the next day , and relying on that they will have a resource , here this resource being the teacher , citing the mere facts about that subject , the students in class a wo nt see it necessary to learn that certain thing in advance .while on the other hand , the students in class b will try to learn that same certain subject in advance , do some research and go to school as prepared as they can be to contribute to the discussions and ideas floating throughout the class .secondly , in terms of creativity , the students in class b will outdo their counterparts in class a , as well .while trying to learn the subject in advance , being motivated as explained in the paragraph above , they will resort to different resources .class a students benefiting from a single resource , will nearly be transformed into birds of a feather , thinking paralelly , while class b students will come to the class being affected from different points of view on the same subject .and that same day so happens to be prone to create new ideas .thirdly and finally , well nourished with novelty caused by inspiration , class b students will try to outdo one another and easily reach success .while on the other hand class a students will be noshing on facts that have already been achieved by some elderly folks before them .
