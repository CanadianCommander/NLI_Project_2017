since the creation of cars , the number of cars constantly grew notably in the advanced and developed countries such as great britain , united-states of america , france and so on .we will see why there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .first of all , the costs of cars decrease that means more people are able to purchase a car .it is possible thanks to the competition between car industries , there are greater competition now than before and i expect that will be the sams thing in the future through the globalization and the outsourcing in poor countries or in developing countries which decrease the price of cars > secondly , in our days , the cars facilitate the life .cars are part of our life because cars are very efficient .in order words , for example , i have a car and i can go everywhere that i want , i have not the constraints of waiting the public tranportation , to see at what time the transport vehicules will come .moreover , when i go to the supermarket and i buy a lot of water , it is far better to use your car rather than the public transportation .thirdly , with cars , you can see and visit your family more frequently than before .because cars go fast the distance between you and your families , friends or people you want to see is shorter .to pocess a car is like a liberty of moving , you can do whatever you want in term of tranportation .to conclude , cars are a important tools of our life , you can use it for a lot of reason such as for going to work , to go to see people , to go to buy something while the public transportation is time over , you can use it to put things that you can not take if you have not car like a big television .in addition , you can go to travel with your familly , somtimes it is cheaper to use your cars than to take the airplane or train .for all those reasons , social and economical , there will have more cars in 20 years .with the emergence of developing countries such as china , brazil , there will be even more cars .
