it is a very interesting topic .as we know , every one want to be a knowledgebal person .being knowledgebal is very impotant and atractive .i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .now i will explain the main reason .having broad knowledge of many acadimec subjects is better than ti specialize in one specific subject .a person who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very wise and good , because he will have many informations about all subject but these informations were general information not specific information .as i see these general information will be good for this person , becaus if anyone ask him a question about any subject , he might know the answer .the main reason that the person who have broad knowledge of many academic subject , he will have self confedence on his self .on the ather hand , some people thought that if they learn about many subject , they will not be concentrate and they will be confused .as i see it also good to specialize in one specifi subject , to concentate well on it .to summarize , i encouredge people to learn about many subject not only one .also in univercitise
