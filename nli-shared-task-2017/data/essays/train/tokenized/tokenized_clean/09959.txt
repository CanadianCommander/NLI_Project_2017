its more important for students to learn more about the facts .the facts are like things that are already done , and the ideas and the concepts are in our minds , so if a student cares more about a fact its because he is secure about what he already now .the fact of a thing its close to what its already exists .for example , the boy jump to the bed and hurt his head .thats a fact , and idea and concept its like , the boy could fracture a leg or arm , its like an idea its all it matter , but what ir really cares its what it really happened .in school the teachers or professors thought more to us about imagination , its near to the concept of a thing .i never got the idea of what should be done , if i already knew what happen for real .the student needs to now how to compare about the definitions of fact and idea or concept , cause if it not he is not going to inferred what the people its talking about , he wouldnt now .i absolute disagree of what the statement says , cause its not really good not to now an important fact before to now the idea or the concept for use .but i can said that to now the idea before the fact it is such a good thing too , cause im not saying that its bad , its also important but not more than the fact .we have to now the importance of what its real and not of what are we imagine , talking about the concepts and ideas .we should care more about good things , and pay attention to all kind of opinions of each person , cause not everyone , even the professors think like we think , so we have to defend our opinion and leave it clean till the end of the discussion .
