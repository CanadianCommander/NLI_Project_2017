before going into medias race , i would like to show up some dependencies as there are nature , recouces in terms of engery like oel and human oppinion and fashion etc .if they all stay as they are at the moment ( no increase of katastrophes , alternative engeries , and having a car will still be a previlige and not unfeshioned ) cars in use will be found in far bigger numbers in twenty years .sice scientists and examinations say the world wide oel-recources will last formore than 50 years and we still wo nt have any opportunities to cars , there will be much more cars in use than today .one reason is , that pruducer release one new model after another in marginal peroides .nad that often in competition with other brands .an other point is that used , demolished and old cars are not dumped but resold or shiped to some poor country , where they re beeing rebuild to run for many years .at the same time population is increasing and more costomers get on the market , what also will have an effect on the numbers of cars in use .if humanity is not changing its perspective of using cars instead of some other , might be futures way of transportation we ll end in the picture i painted above .cars are our all favorite way of getting from one point to another , so we wo nt change out of a free will .in mz oppinion the only way to reduce number of cars is to put taxes ie .on them , or at least on the gazoline thez use .on practical example migth be calefornia , where gouvener schwarzenegger tries with these methods to get hold of the car - and with it the enviromental problem .
