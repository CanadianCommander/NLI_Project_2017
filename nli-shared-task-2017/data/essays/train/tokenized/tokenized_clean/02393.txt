i agree with the given statement that usage of cars will become fewer in the coming twenty years .i can infer this from a practical fact that increase in scarcity of fuel which leads to a hike in fuel prices .and also from the awareness of pollution by the people may make them travel by bus or train .maintaining a car nowadays is a fashion and a symbol of status .but we have many disadvantages from using one .the first on is that we have to spend a lot for its fuel and maintenance .and we sometimes find it difficult to park our car when we go out .due to increase in population in the future due to unavilability of space and due to higher demand there may be a hike in the parking charges too resulting in the withdrawal of usage of cars by many people .when coming to the case of pollution they cause a lot of pollution resulting in various illnesses and health problems of people .so when the people become aware they will stop using the cars in the future .also many number of cars result in traffic jams which are likely to increase with increase in time and population ; so people being aware of these messy things will lessen their usage of cars and limit them only for inportant aspects such as vacation etc. i.e. the daily usage will be limited in the coming days .from the increase in number of cars it results in scarcity of fuel availability resulting in hike of fuel price so much .then i.e. twenty years from now people will stop using cars much .because a large hike in fuel price is likely to occur due to its scarcity for which the orinary man may noy be able to afford .so the number of cars used by ordinary man ill be low .to have a pollution free environment all our public will take necessary measures to limit pollution but when they cant limit it i.e. twenty years from now , they will stop using the cars which are also a cause for pollution .and to meet the expenses for his living due to growth of population in the future one ould limit his expenses by stopping the usage of car which helps him alot by saving a large amount of money wasted on travel .
