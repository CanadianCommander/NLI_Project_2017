is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or is it more important for them to learn facts ?in my opinion it is more important to understand concepts and ideas for several reason .fortunately i had the oppurtunity to experience high-school in germany and in the united states of america .in germany there are no facts asked in test or exams .moreover you absolutely will not find any multiple choice questions .in juxtaposition to this multiple choice questions and remembering facts is basically all i did while i was in chicago .i never really had to work with the facts i memerized .today i can say i forgot almost everything i have learned in the us but i still understand the concepts and ideas that were taught to me in germany .another reason why it is more important to understand concepts is the following .a person that is able to memerize a lot is not necesarilly an intellegent person .so it is possible that a rather unintellegent person gets higher grades in school than person that has a high iq if only facts are asked .in my opionion the studying facts should be rewarded but you should not be able to achieve a very high grade by just memerizing facts .my last and most important point is that understanding ideas and concept prepares you better for your work life .all these facts you might have learned in school will not help you if you can not work with them .and the first step to work with them is to understand the main idea .understanding the main idea makes it also a lot easier to memerize it .so from understanding concepts you pick up facts anyways .i believe if you understand the ideas and concepts you will memerize the most important facts anyways .therefore just memerizing facts is a less advanced way of learning .as a consequent of this it makes it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
