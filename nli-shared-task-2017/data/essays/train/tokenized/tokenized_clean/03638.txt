`` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i am not agree with this statement .the reasons are following :1. as the year goes on technology will improve and this will result in manufacturing good cars in much cheaper rates than today .so as the price of cars decreases more consumer will buy cars .this is simple demand - supply principle of economics .2. also population of world is continuously increasing .the more number of users will be there and they will use more cars .this will imply the usage of more cars than today s era .3. cars are means of transport .in twenty years business will grow rapidy in differnet areas .more packages will have to be delivered or transferred .so this will recquire larger number of transpotaion hence increase in number of cars .4. in next twenty years fashion/glamour will also increase .so each individual will want to have his own car .this will also led to increase in usage of cars .5. in next twenty years number of industry will increase .also industries have to set up in different locations other that residential area to avoid harms from pollution .so more we have to travel greater the need of cars and greater the need larger the number of cars used .6. time is money and time will be much more valuable then .so we will want to cut our times in going one place to another , will want to decrease in travelling time hence to use more good cars as private vehcile .7. more advertisement and product poppularity will also force user to but new advanced car hence increase in number of cars used .these are some of the reasons thats why i think usage of cars will increase in next twenty years .
