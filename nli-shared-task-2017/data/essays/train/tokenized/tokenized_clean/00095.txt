i think how much he/she enjoy life does not depend on how old he/she is .so i disagreeto the statement , because it shows me that the difference of age cause some difference on enjoying life .the main reason of my opinion is whenever people can feel joyful on any situations only by his/her own feeling .and how peolple enjoy life does deeply depend on how people think of happiness .it will change even in the same person in the different ages .the case of sports , for example football , to run or move quickly , we need the good phisical abilities and sensors .the younger people is , the quicker he/she moves .but the quickness or speeds are not only consisted of the joyful of football .to think the stragegy of goal or defence is one of the main portion of making the game .so the expariences of elder people will contribute to feel joyful on football game .so both young and old people have a chance to enjoy football .another case , in the season of roses , a person who knows many roses  names feels happy to get the new one only shown in the books , another person who have a good sensitive nose to feel the difference of the roses enjoy the smell of them .in this case , these two persons skill or talent does not matter with ages .as i mentiond in above two examples , the sensitiveness or musule abilities might depend on how old he/she is .it is one of the difference between young and elder people , mainly coused by matuare and phsical conditions .so there is a possibility for younger people enjoy much more .but we human has a good matuared brain and how happy we are is jugged by his/her own brain .so if the person feel his life is happy , that is the evicence of spending his/her life with happyness and enjoying .anyone without him/herself can jugge how enjoy life anothers person .
