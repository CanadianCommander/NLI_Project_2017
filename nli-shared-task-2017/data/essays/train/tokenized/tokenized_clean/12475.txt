as the need for a better life is growing in developped country , there is more and more commercial business offering different product .some of them will make the same product .those company , not to lose money will , therefore be at `` war  adainst each other .they will need to advertise for their product .to do so they will show us that , first we need this type of product , and second that the one they are offering is better than the one from another company .how do we know if the product of a company `` a  is better than the one from company `` b  , or if the product is as good as it seemed to be ?everyone had once asked the question .we have to understand that the company have to sell their product whatever might happened , and they have to produce it with the less cost possible .so we may ask ourselves if the product we are buying are as good as the advertisements want us to believe it is .it s quite a tough question if we are looking at it closely , there is some company who will show us the product as it really is and some other who wo nt .how can we make the difference ?i guess it s up to us .we have to remember that they are here to sell whatever product it is and therefore has to make it look good .you wo nt buy a product if we are telling you the whole truth , the whole thruth being that there is side effects on this new diet pills or that this cheap tv will only work 45 minutes a day .for me companies have to sell whatever product they are making , and in order to do that they have to present those products on their brightside and telling us only the good part of the story .some will emphasize the good part and let the customer wondering if this wonderfull product really exists and some other will show us the product as it really is .we can ask ourselves how we will be acting if it was us to sell something to another person , either we will be eager to sell it without mentionning couple of problems we had with it , the car we are selling will breakdown at the next corner , or we will be telling the truth saying that the car we are selling will break down but this car is worth the repair to be done .either way , we are not telling the same thing , but we are selling the same thing .i will then say that advertising make the products seem much better than they really are , but it s for one purpose to sell and you wo nt sell something that it s not good enough for your customer .adverstisment is to me like a painter painting a portrait , it will make the product seem better than it really is , the same way a painter will paint the face of someone seem prettier than it really is .we just have to know how much we want to beleive the magnification of the truth .
