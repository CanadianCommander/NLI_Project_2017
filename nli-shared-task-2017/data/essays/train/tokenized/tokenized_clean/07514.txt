i believe that the is no easy answer to this question .one must consider positive and negative aspects of both forms of learning .one the one hand , it is very important to learn and to know facts , espescially while dealing with complex problems .a lack of factual knowledge on a certain subject will render any student unable to properly discuss it with others .when being faced with different facts within a conversation , one can not differentiate whether the information used by one s counterpart is accurate or false .one could be overwhelmed with false information and tricked into believing the counterpart s position , even if it does not give an accurate picture of the topic .a student that has no idea when abraham lincoln lived or served his presidency might be convinced by others that he fought for the rights of african americans in the 1960 s instead of during the civil war .on the other hand , a mere learning of facts does not reveal to a student the interconnection between them and how one fact might lead to another .a student that has learned the names an inauguration dates of all us presidents does not necessarily know anything about their achievements and could therefore never enter an argument on which president best represented the middle class or fought for equal rights .this is where the understanding of ideas and concepts becomes important .in conclusion , i would say that in order to fully grasp any subject and to be able to discuss it with others one has to find a balance between the learning of facts and the understanting of ideas and concepts .while some students may find it harder to learn facts they might compensate this with a great understanding of the underlying concept and vice versa .however , no student should ever completely neglect any of these two forms of learning .
