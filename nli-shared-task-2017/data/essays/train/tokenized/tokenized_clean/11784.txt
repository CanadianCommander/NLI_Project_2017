i completely agree with this statement .people become successful if they try different jobs and attain success in them .but trying different jobs involves risk .hence to become successful tring different risky jobs is essential to any person .anyone have to try differet jobs to know in which they are talented as well as interested .if we go on doing the same things which we know , there is no further gain .we as well as lose the interest in what we are doing and finally get bored .then we cant move further .we just dont know the destination .if we go on trying new things we will certainly reach our destination one day or the other .then we can develop ourselves in that task .few of the scientists have invented the best things which we are using today by experimenting in different fields or tasks .according to me without experimenting and taking risk one can not achieve the best of what he can .though not experimenting may not make the person a failure .enjoying life somewhat involves in attempting various tasks .actually , the law of life is to face new tasks day-by-day .this law is just implemented to attain success .we see in our day to day life , many people in different fields are trying new tasks .few examples are -actors trying in different concepts and themes to show their versatality , bussiness-man introducing new products and new advertising techniques , software engineers tring to work out and invent new soft wares etc . ..trying on different jobs may lead people to failure many-a times but this should not become a break to their experimental nature .they should recover from the failures and rise to success as said in the following proverb - `` failures are stepping stones for success  .this means that a person can learn a lot from failure about what to do and not to do .this experience makes the person more and more perfect as the time progresses .so according to me everyone should try new tasks and accept challenges in life not only to attain success but also to enjoy the life in various aspects .
