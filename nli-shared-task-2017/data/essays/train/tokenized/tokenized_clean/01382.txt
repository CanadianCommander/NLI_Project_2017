fewer cars in the futureas the cars running in the streets currently seem to grow to a larger population steadily , do you believe there will be any declination of them in the future ?but let me ask you some other questions .do you feel the world is getting more and more poluted nowadays ?do you find yourself long to see the bright blue sky and beautiful nature scenes which were hidden for quite a period of time and wish give a little contribution in the project of rescue our planet ?and do you believie that there will be a transportation developed to change the 21 century ?yes !so , why believe in your smoking car will still possess the streets in 20 years ?ever since the great inventions of mashines in the 19 and 20 century , our beautiful planet has been poluted out of her beautiful blue sky , the amazing great clean oceans , the pleasent green spaces and the happiness connections between human beings and nature .the cars , which have developed into comunity possess a really great number in their kind , are puting waste gas into the air without stopping .a lot of people who have realised this situtation have already abandoned their private cars and joined into the bank of people who take buses and subway and other forms of public transportation .walking and cycling are also a recommand way .it is believed that in 20 years the environmental awareness will be universally improved and more and more people will quit the idea of always relying on their car which will results in the less number of cars in the future .besides , i believe formly that a brand new transportation that will lead to less or no polution will be invented in the future not far away .the developing of science has been so amazing in the past a hundred year so it is very likely that science will bring us another surprise in the 21 century .upon these ideas , i believe there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than nowadays .with the combination of the strong will to make a better place of our planet of human beings , and the fast developing of science , my belief will ultimately come true .
