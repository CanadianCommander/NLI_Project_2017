on my own opinion , i do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what thay already know how to do well .first , i think they can success is because they have already take their risk , it is all risk out side the world , each thing has a risk but seems to big or small .for example , if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be a accident on you .taking risk is a must .the mean of success is they know how to do things well , human being has a think to learn more to find out new things .of course , by the way people is learning they will have many problems to solve .successful people knows that if they do nt find a new way or new thing to do , other people can catch up them .they want to lead , so they have to seek , to seek what that the world needs so they can do it .although many people think successful people are selfish , just do things they like or they want , wo nt share with others , but i think it is only other people do nt understand what they are thinking .they have a different thought than others so they success , they wo nt just stop where they success .they want more success , everyone wants more success but not everyone can do it , so they know they can do it they wo nt care about the risk , even the risk is big but if they can pass it they success .they fail , they keep on going to find another thing .for conclusion , i agree that successful people tyr new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
