this statement is actually a question that people already do in this particular moment with more frecuency than in the past .what is better in order to have a good job ? .is it better to known a variety of knowlegde ? .nobody has the thruth but many features are taking into account regardless to this matter .i am disagree with the statement considering aspects such as academic position , type of themes or discipline that a person can choose and technology advances that has been make a significant impact in our way of see the reality and the society .first , if we are talking about and undergraduate student is better to have a broader perspective of reality , in other terms a backgroung of knowlegde on many academic subject .this would improve the ability to choose an specific area in which the student can do a master degree .on the other hand , a graduate student of course would prefer an specialize career on an specific subject .second , for example a doctor will need a specialization because of the complexity of the human being and the advances that the medicine has already made .if a person go for a graduate in sociology , she or he will need to know as much as they can to understand the people and the society that affect that people .moreover , literature and arts also need a widespread of knowledge to compare and contrast the variety of view points that imply every kind of art .finally , non of these arguments are out of the technology and the amazing boom that the world is living right now .because of the access to internet we can learn many academics subjects as well as to find and to specialize on a specific theme .nevertheless , these are point of view from one perception of the world , it depends on people to decide and follow in which direction will be more benefitial to go .
