to have a knowledge of any academic subject is very important because we can learn how to think in an academic way with this type of study and thinking in that way make us to ask questions about anything in life .there is a lot of subjects to specialize but i would choose to specialize in only one specific subject and this can also help me to learn how to ask .acoording to me , if you decide to learn something , you have to give all your energy to it , and this helps you to notice and understand every detail about the subject .because every detail has a reason and these reasons take you to the profession on the subject .the point is , you have to understand and feel the sense of your subject .with studying the regular parts and then studying the details , you can achieve in any subject .moreover , how much time you spend on your subject is the other important point .due to the changes , you should keep on studying and develop your researches .if you decide to specialize in subjects more than one , it will be difficult to research all the meterials , actually details . .i can give a primitive example that i decided to apply for the conservatory in u.s. , and they want me to give a recital , take the toefl andpass the musician placement examinations .first i started to study for all of them at the same time , but after a while i realize that i forgot some details about each subject , and start to study one by one .this helps me to finish all the work .although i can not allienate myself from both sides , i would choose to study for only one subject and got the broad knowledge of it .i believe only this way can let you to have a dominant character studyingin academically .
