i m completely agree with this sentence .in fact i beleave that i live in the generation of advertising .in this period what the people say is more important than the real qualities of a product .on televisions or on the pages of newspapers there are always an infinity of sponsored products : shoes , t-shirts , caps , but also hams , biscuits or different types of cheese .we can find all types of product .all day my prefered football player or the champion of the world of tennis suggest me what is the product better for me and how i have spent my time .and i do nt buy a particular object only for its qualities or its price , but also because i see it on journal .this is the scope of marketing : `` to make products better than they really are  .this is an economic law and some firms know it very well .the same product with different brands has two different values , it is caused by continous advertising .really this products are not better than other without a famous brand , often they are products of low quality , but only with a good testimonial or a good sponsor .
