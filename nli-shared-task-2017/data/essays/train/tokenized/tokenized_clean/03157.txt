most of people love cars and want cars .buying a new fency car is a dream to billions of people who do not have a car .the quantity of the car will increase continuosly in several decades .because of cheap car , developing country and desire of people increase the number of cars .first , our car technology is advanced rapidly past several years , and it makes car cheaper .it is hard to imagine to own the car in 70 s for non-rich family .my father told that there are fewer than one hundred cars in oursity when he was young .so he did not think about having the car , but he has one now .because of the cheap car , cars will increase in twenty years than there are today .second , there are hundreds of developing country and undeveloped country .these countries will develop like other countries someday , the similarity of the developing country is growing of the car population .in 1950 s korea was one of the poor countries in the world because of the korean war .but , after america s assistance korea became modern country in 30years .in 1950 s only few foriegner owned the car .but after 30years every single family had car .last , the desire of people will increase the car population .most of men wants to buy a car if they had a lot of money .in fact , most of rich people has more than two cars .and people like them are increasing too .when i saw the tv , there are a rich person who has 70 cars in his home .it was hard to belive , but the show says that there are millions of people who have cars more than ten and it will increase .in conclusion , it is obvious that too many cars can cause air pollutions , traffic jams and more car accidents .but these reasons actually can not stop the growing car population .
