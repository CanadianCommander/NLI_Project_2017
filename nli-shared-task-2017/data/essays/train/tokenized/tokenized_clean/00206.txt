the modern world of technology has changed the life of a common man altogether .advertisement technology is at its peak in this centuary creating ripples in the mind of people by forcing to buy the products thats are of substandards .newspapers , media , printing technology , door to door advertisement and mouth to mouth adverstising has increased substantially in the recent years .all the products used by a person from the time he wakes up in the morning till he sleeps are advertised everywhere and anywhere .the product company invest lot of money into adversitising its products buy paying a huge amount to a celebrity star , designing and redesigning the labels and try to increse there sales of the product and reep the benefits .infact these companies are ripping off the poeple .millions of money spent for the adverstisement can be diverted towards the maintainance of the stanndars fo the product .if the product is really good and worthy neither the advertisement maker or the celebrity participating in the adversitisment many not know the standats of the products are .for example , the fizz drinks consumed by almost all in the world .it was proved many times that the cococola or pepsi have pesticised that are harmful to the people .still the company hires a super star from a film industry andboost the sales of its products .consumers buy the drinks jus becasuse their favourite star has acted in the advetisement .many instance of healt hazardous levels of pesticides were found .after careful observation and sufficent evidence i strongly agree that many products are of less standard than the thwey are advertised .
