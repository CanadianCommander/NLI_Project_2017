on a personnal account , i think that everyone should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .according to me , specializing in one specific subject is extremely dangerous and could undermine the way our societies work .firstly , i assume that being specialized in a particular academic subject is most harmful to your intellectual skills and the way you think .when you are being taught about a particular subject , you not only learn facts , theories or historical events but you also learn a way of thinking .for instance , learning mathematics will help you develop a rational process of thinking , nonetheless you will not improve your human relations by resolving equations .this could explain why some engineers , with a scientifc cultural background , find difficult to evolve in companies .secondly , i think that in our developped societies it has become impossible to remain specialized throughout you entire life .imagine an artist , she has never taken any courses but artistic ones .she founds a galery to expose and sell her works , how will she be able to make it if she has never learnt accountancy or marketing methods ?she will certainly go on bankrupt in a few months .had she followed management courses , she would have made her gallery flourish .i recognize that society still needs very specialized people .what make things work has become so complex that you can not hope to succeed if you do not have deep and acurate knowledge .however , extending this specialization to everyone could jeopardize our societies .if people did not share the same knowledege and the same cultural background , they could no longer support themselves and live together .knowledge creates bounds within people and should always be shared .in conclusion , i assume that knowledge is a precious gift , you have a right to protect it and share it .by endorsing broad academic knowledge , you have a clearer acount about people and society , and will be more useful that if you are too specialized .
