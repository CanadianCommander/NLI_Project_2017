the time dedicated by young people to their communities is of a great importance .it shows the interest of the younger generation for their families and culture background .i believe the young people do not spend enough time to helping their communties .they certainly have good reasons but the reward of helping is priceless .why do young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities ?i see two main reaons : professional life and new communication technics .our parents used to spend most of their careeer in one or maximum two companies , in only one country .nowadays , professional life is more suprising .one can change position very quickly , depending on opportunities .positions are not fixed and young generation has less links with the employeer than older generation had .the firm root is not a major concern for young generation .communication and travel improvements allow people to move from one country to another one quicker than ever .life is not be lived only in your home country .internet gives you the opportunity to instantly travel via your computer .your community is the world , your friends are all over the world .young people will have more difficulty to follow and support their community as the community root is more difficult to identify .but young people will have to settle themselves down one day .where will be their community at that time ?where will be their home land ?this question will be very hard to answer unless you took a great care of your roots and specifically of your community .that is the reason why i believe that giving some time to helping our community is priceless in regards of the rewards it will then bring us .community will be what stays from an active professional life .community will be your home .you have to take good care of your home for the time you will either need it or be back in it .
