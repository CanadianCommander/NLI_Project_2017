i agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse there are two main points of my view about agreement .these are that young people enjoy their life in technological way and social way .first of all , recently , the technology wich surround our life astonishingly immproved a lot .several decade ago , noone could imagin how the technology develop like now generation .older people s activity was limitted due to unsufficient technology of their lives .back in their day , they had to use old style technology to accomplish their purposes , in contrust , it was nt efficient .it took more time and energy than now .it mean , older people s enjoyable time was robbed by efforting .on the other hand , new technology has very high quality .it succeeded cutting off wasty time to do something compare with older people did .so , younger people can afford to having a good time as spending the time to their hobby and thing witch they has interest .secondly , by using a high technology , the sociaty of younger people is expanded its range .now , there are a lot of ways to communicate with unknown people like internet , cell phone , and some sort of book .we have many oppotunities to know each other and to make a new friendship with new people .to know new people , we can shear the time and our thought .it probably more enjoyable for young people .however , older people could nt do that becouse as i mantioned before , there is no way to accomplish this method at the age .
