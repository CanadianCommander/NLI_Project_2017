in my opionion this statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is wrong .i think it is better to have a specialized knowledge , because we live in a time where knowledge gets more and more specialized .in school you can see this argument good , because zou first learn the basics of a method and then it gets more and more specialized .for example you first learn plus and minus in math and later on it gets more and more complex .maybe it is good to have a broad konwledge later in life , because than you can expand on more fields , for example in your job .but as you can see there is more unemployment than before , because companys need less poeple to work on the machines .at this point it is good to have a specalized knowledge , because you are different form all the others , who are looking for a job .so specific knowledge let you stand out and helps you to get a better job .this is an argument for this , but it has it s disadvantages , too .if the job you specified on is already given to somebody with the same field of knowledge , it could bring up problems , because you field of study is very popular and there are not much jobs you could choose from .this is one argument for the broad knowledge .but broad knowledge does nt let you stand out form the masses .this is why you have to balance your knowledge between broad and specific knowledge .but there are ways to study something specialized and get a good job or a variety to choose from .this is made by just looking up statistics and looking up which job needs personal .another way to solve that problem is to look up if you job is needed in a different state or country and apply for this on if you got the money .but the best solution is to balance the specific and the broad knowledge , but in mzy opinion it is still better to have a specialized knowledge before you have a broad knowledge .
