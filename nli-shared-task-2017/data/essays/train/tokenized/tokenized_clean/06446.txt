i would like to begin my essay with prof. abert einstein  s telling .he had said that understanding of a problem is the half of the solving .we can not analyze concepts and ideas without not knowing what we have on our hand .therefore , i think to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts .a greater number of people , on the world , are now judging each other without understanding each other s ideas and ideologies .and they learn facts without an infrastructural information .this rival makes them merciless .because they do nt know how they should react .for instance , we assume a man who helps poor people without judging them getting them dressed , clear and satiated and assume his neighbour has nt any idea what the man makes .our man accept his home all kinds of people olders , kids , women and men .if firstly , his neighbour doesn  t understand his ideas and then call police to learn the fact , an inappropriate event occurs .but firstly , if he understands his idea .no problems occur .as our knowledge grows regarding various diseases , we become better equipped with sense .
