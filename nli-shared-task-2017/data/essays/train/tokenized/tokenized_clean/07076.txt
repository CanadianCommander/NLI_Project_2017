life is a series of experiences .these experiences start from birth till life ends .if a series of experiences are enjoyable , we percieve that part of our life as good .if we went through a series of bad experiences , we percieve our life to be dull & bad .thus , the degree of enjoyment one encounters in life is a result of the quality of the sum of series of experiences one had in a lifetime .i disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .i strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experiences in life is dependent on various factors , the most important being one s own mental-set .for example : an old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself .so , enjoyment is not based on age .it is one s own mind set & its ability to percieve things positively & appreciate them .in turn it will result in an enjoyable experience .living life enjoyably is a skill .it has to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge .the young people assume partying , going out with friends , seeing movie are the great enjoyments that they are experiencing .but they are least exposed to the fact that these are only traces of happinees , just like bubbles on the water surface .there are deeper , intense & more joyful moments in life .the emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyments older people go possess .with age comes maturity & stability to withhold happiness .the experiences of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people .this makes them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it .in my opinion an older person is a better taster of different kinds of enjoyments in life .
