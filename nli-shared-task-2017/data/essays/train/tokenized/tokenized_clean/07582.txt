i agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .the purpose of education in a particular field is to provide the student with a generic framework of ideas and concepts .the student understands these ideas and concepts and applies them to complex real world scenarios to provide solutions to problems or to contribute effectively in an industry .mere knowledge of facts does not enable the student to solve problems .let us consider education in the field of fluid mechanics as an example .a student learning concepts and ideas of fluid flow can utilize his knowledge to simulate flow of oil in wells and reservoirs and thus contribute to the oil and gas industry .if he does not have facts and figures he can easily procure them from a library or even the internet .on the other hand a student who merely memoizes facts and figures may not be in a position to undersatnd their significance in real world scenarios and hence of no value to the industry .it is human nature to remember and appreciate complex forms of information if they are logical .concepts and ideas help the student to visualize the problem in a logical way as compared to mere facts and figures .consider for example the study of ecosystems for extinction of certain species .a student who understands the ideas and concepts of an ecosystem and how a generic eco system works can clearly analyze why a particular species in an ecosystem is becoming extinct at a faster rate than in another ecosystem .on the other hand a student who has learnt just facts and figures of ecosystems finds it difficult to apply his knowledge extensively to analyze solve complex problems in his field .thus we see that by having a good understanding of concepts and ideas enables us to solve real world problems in a more effective manner .thus we conclude that the purpose of education can be best achieved by giving more importance to understanding of concepts and ideas then just facts .
