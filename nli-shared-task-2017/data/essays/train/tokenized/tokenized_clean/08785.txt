i totallay agree with the statement , that it is better , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject .i did a professinal education as a media designer and now i am studying media sciences , political sciences and cultural sciences , and therefore i can tell from my own experience , that it is very important today , to have knowledge of a variety of topics .first of all , my studies showed me more than once , that many developments , they may be cultural or technical , are connected in some way .so , when you have knowlegde about different subjects , you can develop a much better understanding concerning the whole situation .what is more is , that a broad education is very useful for later business life .today , jobs are not that restricted and limited anymore .almost every modern job applies an excellent general knowledge .during my eduacation , for example , i had to show creative skills on the one hand , and mathematical and technical skills on the other hand .studies also show , that few people would keep one job for their whole life .there is a certain tendency , that people will have two ore more jobs during their lifetime .my mother is a good a example for this development .first , she did an education as a nurse .when she became mother , she stayed at home for 10 years .now , back in business life , she works as an german teacher .all in all i think , i made clear , why i am convinced that a broad knowlege of various subjects is necessary .the key word for the 21th century definetly is flexibility and i think , that universities in particular should support that development by offering a huge variety of academic subjects .
