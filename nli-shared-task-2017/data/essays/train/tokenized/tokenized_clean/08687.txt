sometimes , people likes to be alone and they imagine to go abroad by themselves .on the contrary , i like to travel by groups because it is more beneficial for the novice of traveling .by group traveling , we can save more time and money .in addition , we can gain good information from a tour guide .the first benefit of group tour is time .we can save lots of time in group tour because a guide knows where we should go next .for example , if i get to a place , i probably waste lots of time to find a parking lot .last year i visited the historical place of dallas , tx , where j.f.kennedy had a shot .i spent for 30 minutes to find proper place to park .in addition , we are to lose directions .the second reason is the financial .the group tour does not require gas or parking fee .for instance , my family visited new york and niagara fall three years ago when we stayed in chantly , virgina .they chareged us only 450 dollars each person .we had great tour around there for four days .before the tour , i calculated the amount of tour a person .it was 700 dollars .lastly , we can gain good information from a guide .they are well educated about the traveling .when i had a tour new york , a guide showed me that how puritans settled down in plymouth and how new york became the center of world trade .when he said the life of new yorkers , especially immigrated from my country korea , i could understand their pain in lives .as i listed above , i prefer to have a group tour because it saves time , money and allows me to have good knowledge about traveling place .of course , i had a experience about traveling with only my wife to washington d.c. last year .i think it was possible to have a tour without a guide because d.c. had very good and convenient transportation .
