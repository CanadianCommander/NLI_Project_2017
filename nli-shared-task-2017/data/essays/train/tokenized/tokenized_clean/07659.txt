i agree with the statement , and think that more should be done by people to help their communities .first of all , it s easy to notice that many young boys spend their time in videogame centers , wasting a lot of time and doing nothing useful for the community .besides , even if they spend hours in such amusement places , they do nt look happy at all .probably this is due to the lack of human relationships that emerge from spending time with videogames , so i think that if they start spending their time in helping their community they will both use their time in a better way and be happier .for example , they could perform acts for entertaining old people .this would make them make friends among other player , and let them show their ability in singing or playing , or just let them enjoy in an environment that doenst require any professional skill .another useful activity young people could do for their community would be go to elementary schools and sensibilize kids about the problem of bullism , in an age where it emerges .if older people , like teachers , explain children that bullism is a bad , meaningless , completely unuseful thing , kids will probably start behaving even worse , to show that they are strong and `` adult  enough to oppose teacher suggestions .conversely , if young boys or girls in the age of 20s , who are often seen as a model by kids , explains that `` being a bull is not cool at all  , then studens usually start to behave better .i know it seems strange , but i can say it by a personal experience of mine that it really works .anyway i am happy to notice that some developments has occurred .for example , in my childhood there was not so much attention on the conditions of the riversides of my city main river .they were really dirty , you could find anyhing there , from bicycles to refrigerators , from old tv sets to washing machines .however now , once a year , during a spring event people clean for free those riversides , and in few years it became a nice river where some people start even to fish , something that was unbeliveable until about ten years ago .this makes me confident in thinking that more and more nice activities will be developed , and that more and more people will devote their time to useful activities that help their communities and , i think , their own life too .
