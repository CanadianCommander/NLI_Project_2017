i agree with the statemnt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having broad knowledge in one subject confines you only to one field of study .not only that but it also confines your mind to not think about anything else except thatsuject .the other disadvantage is that having in depth knowledge in one subject also confines your future job oppurtunities because of lack of knowledge in other fields .so it is always beneficial to have knowledge of many academic subjects .by having knowlege in all sujects the individual is more accomplished to solve any problem in any field .it also increases the fleibility of the person .his futue will also be very bright as he will have sound knowledge in all the subjectsthough acquiring knowledge is tough and also a time taking process it is definitly worth the hard work as u are presnted with fruitful rewards .for example jon and smith work in the same office jon has knowlege about all the subjects where as smith only specialized in technical details of the company .when a prolem arises in the technical department .both of them can solve the problem easily .but when a problem arises in the managemet department only jon can solve the problem .so jon can solve both the management and the technical problem .where as jon can solve only the technical problem .so jon is more flexible in his work than smith is and has a definite edje over smithnot only this having knowledge in different subjects also increases the efficiency of a human being .he can definitely do more work if he has sound knowledge in different fields .so i conclude that it is always better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specializing ione specific subject .
