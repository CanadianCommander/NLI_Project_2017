i totally agree with this statement .advertisements make products look better than what they truely are .public media and ads that show up on tv are the ones to blame .they use the latest technology in tv production to make the advertisement look as attractive as possible to the audience therefore increasing the popularity of such product between the audience .more colours , impressive stunts , unbelievable manuevers are all aspects that make up a good commercial .lets take david beckham s perfume advertisement for exampe .it was shown on tv all over the middle east .it portrayed him kicking the ball half way through the soccer field and the ball amazingly was netted in the far end corner of the goal .that kind of goal would have never happened in real life and the chances of it occuring might be a big , fat zero .david beckham is an icon in the world of soccer , he is a multi millionare , married to a former member of spice girls ( posh spice ) and plays in one of the best football clubs in the world of football which is real madrid .every body in here were talkin about this advertisements and people including me qeued infornt of the super markets to get a bottle of this so called  amazing  perfume as refered to in the advertisement .i finally got it , but unfortunately i was shocked by the results .the scent of the perfume was awful to me and to the majority of the customers that bought it .a public poll was even made when the perfume was released and the results supported my opinion greatly .eventhough the container that had the perfume looked fancy and unresistable , i was shocked by its content .in the end beckham s name and logo on the container will not make the scent as glorious as the goal scored in the t.v commercial stated earlier .
