i agree in part with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects than having speciality only in one specific subject .i give my views and opinions to my decision .firstly , having broad knowledge in every field of academics is essential to know the different aspects of our day to day life .like having a knowledge about biology is essential even to a mathematician in his daily life .silmilarly , having knowledge about buisiness , art , technologhy is also essential to him .these apply to all the fields of people , a botanist or zoologist needs maths for his statistical analysis and geography to study the distribution of life .a buisinessman should be aware of the software programs to use in his buisiness life .a software engineer also requires knowledge regarding changing costs and about the finances .on the contrary spending so much of time in studying all the fields makes his time less to master his own subject .society needs specialists in every field of academics from doctors , engineers and in every field of life .taking example of a doctor , he needs to study all the subjects in medicine to a basic extent .later if he specialises in a particular subject like cardiology , pediatrics or gyneacology .he should have awareness of the complaints and diseases all kinds of people suffer from .because if a women comes to a see a cardiologist and he finds she also has a gynaecological problem he should immediately refer her to a gynaecologist .this shows the respect and smartness of a doctor in dealing her overall health status .but he is a specialist and he can correct her cardiac problem alone which a nonspecialist doctor could not do .so specialisation is required in every academic subject to show maximum results of the study and master the field one is in .on the other hand basic knowledge about all the other subjects should be incured in every individual which is required in this current era .
