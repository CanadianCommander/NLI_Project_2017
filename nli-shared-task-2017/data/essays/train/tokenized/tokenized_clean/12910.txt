i agree with this statement .because in these days we have a lot of advertisements and every day we have new products .when you watch the avertisement at the tv or when you see it in the news paper or on the street you are very impress .and i thing that most of the time the focus on the design , the way that they wrap the product , than the quality .and the reason that they do that is to attract the costumer .because if you see a product and the wrap is very attactive you will attempt to buy it and once you do , it is totally different from what you was thinking you will be disapointed .for example when can see an advertisement of a naew product on the tv an you want to try it .let s say it is a deodorant anti-transpirant .you saw the advertisement and they was saying that if you use it tou will not sweat all day long and it does not leave any marks on your clothes or you body .you decide to try it .you just go at the store and buy it .in the morning you put your deodorant anti-transpirant and you out. a couple of hour later you see that you are really sweating and there are some marks on your clothes .and you will ask yourself what happens i use the deodorant as indicate and i am sweating  it was not suppose to happen .this is how the advertisements work .people just want to make money trough the advertisement by focusing on the design , the color , how it looks than the quality of the product himself .ans most of the time
