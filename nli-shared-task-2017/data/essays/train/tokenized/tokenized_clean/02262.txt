according to me successful people always go for the new things instead of going for the things that are well known .they will consider the ideas of the known things and try to go in a new way .so i agree with the sentence that successful people take risks for getting things to be done .suppose if we go for a well known matter there will be no chance of taking risk .we know what the result is going to be .we are not taking the risk in that where as if take the risk and obtain the thing or work done it will be satisfactory for us also .when i was in school my friends use to read only one publication where as i used to read three publications .i used to answer for most of the qusetions asked by the teachers .my friends used to say me that its waste of reading all the publications available in the market .at the end of the examinations i was the top student in the class .but when i was preparing for the examinations my friends told me that i am going to fail the test and they asked me to read only the prescibed textbook instead of going for other books .but i know that i am going to score high in the class .i took risk and i was successful at the end .but one thing we have to keep in mind is that we should be careful while we are taking the risk .we should work hard for getting the desired reults .most of the successfful world famous scientists also took risk and obtained fruitful result .if we dont take risk we dont have a scope to work .so most of the successful bussiness persons and other people who are successful in life will take some risks to achieve the good results .if we want to do something new then we have to take risk definately .so its better to take risk in a proper manner and obtain the good results .
