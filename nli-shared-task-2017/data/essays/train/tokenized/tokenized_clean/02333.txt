i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in fact , i believe that in any mature market , this embellishment of the truth on the part of the advertisements is inevitable .it all begins from the fact that usually , most companies do nt have the luxury of being in a product space where they have a monopoly .this means that they are continously competing with each other to sell their products .this means that they have to constantly innovate to try and make a better product .but the innovation does nt stop just at the production , it continues into the selling stage and that s where advertisements come into the picture .now in an ideal world , an advertisement would be indistinguishable from the specification of the product .a company would just state the features of the product in a technically accurate manner and let the buyer decide .unfortunately , in the real world , usually , the buyer is a human being , which means that he most probably does nt have the time , patience or even at times the expertise to make a decision based on just the specification .this means that the information provided to the buyer needs to be summarized into simpler and easily digestable form .it is this gap between the real specification and the information provided to the customer that advertisements really become an important tool in boosting sales .thus while summarizing the information , advertisements give the company the opportunity to smooth over the defects and accentuate the good qualities of the product .to take an analogy , the same way make-up enhances a woman s beauty , advertisements enhance a product s appeal .also , considering that only that much can be done to improve sales on the production side ( for example , how much innovation can really be done in a tooth-brush ? )after some time , advertisements are left as the only viable alternative to push sales .and once one company starts advertising , the others have to naturally follow which soon degenerates into a rat race of who can bend the truth more .therefore , one ends up with ` new-improved  shampoos where the only thing that has been improved is the label , health equipment which can make you lose weight almost instanteously , and tooth-paste which can land you that dream-job or man .
