learning is a very important part of students life .i think learning in any form adds to ones information and knowledge areas .therefore in my opinion when a student is at undergraduate level he should take variety of courses both in the areas of learning facts and understanding ideas and concept .on the otherhand when a student is taking up a graduate program he or she should take up a course which involves understanding the concepts and ideas .for example taking a professional course in the understaning of computers is better than studying history or geography .i beleive that task becomes easier and more enjoyable if one tries to understand instead of memorizing it .thus a practical approach is better than rote learning .i feel learning facts is not as much interesting as understanding concepts .thus i agree with the statement .
