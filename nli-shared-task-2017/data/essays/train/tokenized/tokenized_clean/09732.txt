historically the growth on the numbers of cars has been keept increasing constantly since the third decade of the previous century .there are no signs of any reversal on this patern , and moreover recent research shows that the situation could be worst on the next years .first , as the world develops , more families are able to get a car , nowdays the cars are not only for rich and welth people , reduction on the final costs , for average cars ( luxury cars are keep apart of this analysis ) , and the improvement on the world average salary , probably helps to narrow the original economical divide .countries under develpment , are a huge potential market for new cars , as the economies of this contries get develop , the life quality of the population grows , also their expectations and their posibilities to get new cars .other people migth say , that fuel costs , pollution regulations , and the limited parking space on big cities could stop the sales , and begin with a reduction on the total number of available cars .against this people i could only ilustrate that the costs on fuel are comparatively lower today if we compare the fuel with many other products .the regulations to decrease pollutions are adopted by each individual countries , and also the new cars are complaint about most of this regulations .the other aspect about parking spaces , could be mitigated with the reduction of car sizes or the develop of new parking technologies .personally , i do belive that in twenty years this number of used cars will be much more that there are today , maybe is not the best for us , maybe it is .however based the actual rate of growth of the number of cars , and the amazing development of the world , especialy on the underdevelop countries , it is easy to predict a grow .
