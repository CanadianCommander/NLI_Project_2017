i definitly agree with the statement of `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what the already know how to do .in this essay , i am going to state my views h in my opion , a successful people are willing to try new things and take risks .first , they will not afraid of failure because trying new things can help them to learn more and braoden their horizons .for example , a successful person , edison , who invented the light bulb was used to be a normal boy whois good at study .but how come he can be a successful person ?it is because he was willing to try new thing - to be an inventor .he took a lot of risks on doing the experiment , but he did not give up , ended up , became a successful people .despite there maybe a risk , they will still keep on trying new things and take these risks to become a more successful person in the future .second , if a successful people only focus on doing what they already know how to do well , they are not that successful .they maybe successful in this short period only , as there are many other people try new things and to be a more successful people .the successful period of that person is limited by himself , sooner or later , others learn his skills and he will no longer be a successful one .to conclude , i think that successful people should keep on trying new things .they should not just keep on doing what they already how to do well , otherwise , people will not claim you as a successful person , they will tease on you because you think yourself is a successful people and
