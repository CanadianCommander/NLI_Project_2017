i think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .in my opinion , if you understand the concept , you have always time to learn facts or dates .in children education , for example , it s important to give them the instruments to understand nature and society .i think it s not so important to fill them with dates and facts .morever , if a child understand a concept , he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life .if he learn a fact without understanding it , he will forget it in a month .for example , i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old , just because my teacher explained the meaning of them .i can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explenation of them .if a teacher tells a fact without explaining it for the children has no sense and they do nt put attention on it .the same is in adults education .in the university of medicine , for example , is much more important to understand how to visit a patient , than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body .you always have time to take a book and learn it .i have to mention that there are facts or notions that people need to know .for example a doctor , of course has to understand how the body works and how to visit a patient , but he also has to know the dosis of the medicaments or the name of the most important parts of the body .an antropologist has to understand the human behavior but he also has to know about history and languages and cultures .so , even if ideas and concepts are more important in education , there are some facts and notions than students have to learn .
