at first is to say both ways are important for students .you have to learn facts sometimes but also you have to understand ideas and concepts in general .i would say you can really understand concepts if you have learnt a few facts before .i imagine to be a student in information technology .how could i understand the requirements and the development of a secure and professional working it network for a company e.g. , without exactly knowledge of the features and performance of the components for such a network , both hardware components and software components ?in my oppinion the learning of facts is often the basis to go the next steps .only if i have achieved a very good level of detailed knowledge , a very good level of known facts and information i will be able to think in higher dimensions and to understand the context and goal of this descriped ideas and concepts .the experience from practice will support the ability to create successful concepts .to talk about another example .i have to develop a marketing concept for a special new product .how can i do this without knowing how the product works , what the consumer requires and so on .in other words , before i can develop marketing concepts i should have sold a few products , i should have talked to a few consumers of the regarding market segment .i should also have done a few market research to learn the most important topics about competitors .all this `` to do  can be descriped as learning of facts , either learning in theory or learning in practice .both ways of learning facts are very important to be successfull later in understanding and also creating ideas and concepts .so as a summary i would say it is not the question what is more important , learning facts or understand concepts but it is the question what comes as first .i am sure both of them are very important
