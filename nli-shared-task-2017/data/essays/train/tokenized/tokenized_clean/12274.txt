i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are many reasons why young people enjoy their life moreone reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do nt worry about everything .young people mostly only think from one day to the other and do nt make any future plans .like getting a stable job to feed a family .mostly they wo nt have a family until their mid thirties .another reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because they are independent .their entire thinking is different from old people .they do nt choose a job only because of the salary they also want to have a fullfilling job which is challenging .a job which offers further options maybe to work in a different country .nowadays young people work to live on - older people live to work .while older people think about security young people sometimes just quit their job if they are not satisfaied anymore .the third reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because the have more options to enjoy themselves .there are plenty of free time activities they can go to .there many clubs , bars etc. which meet young people s interestes .whereas there are only a few clubs or bars where old people can go to without getting stared at .young people are able to go almost anywhere they want to without any age limits .all together young people have plenty of reasons to enjoy life more than older people .
