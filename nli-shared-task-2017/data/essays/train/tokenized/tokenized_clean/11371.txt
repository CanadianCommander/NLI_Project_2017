it s often said that travel without a tour guide is a countless benefits living in a state of art society .however , i strongly argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because people do nt have enough knowledge about the place they go and it will save to waste of time .to begin with , group travel with a tour guide have positive influence on gathering information .a tour guide is specialized in traveling , so the man know a countless of knowledge about the place which people travel such as popular parks , beautiful restorants , and even world famous traditional foods in the place .for example , when i was a freshman in university , i planned to journey to usa .although i searched information about the country , when i was in usa , i could nt find any places where i really wanted to go .that s because the information i found was not up - date one .moreover , the travel help people save traveling time .most of group tours have a well planned schedule .it prevent people waste of time to see the place which people do nt need to go to .for instance , my sister , juny kim , went to canada with a group members in 1999 .even though it was just a week to travel , she and her group members traveled all around canada s famous places such as ubc in vancouver , quback and even rocky mountain because of tight schedule of a special guide .in conclusion , without any doubts , i significantly agree with a group travel because of benefits from saving traveling time within tight schedules and gathering information .if you do nt enough imformation where you will go abroad in this winter , i suggest that you have only two decisions .one is you should give up the plan and the other option is traveling with a tour guide .
