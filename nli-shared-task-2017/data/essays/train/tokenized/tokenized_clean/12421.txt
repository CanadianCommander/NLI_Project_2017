nowadays , students are exposed to learn things that they do nt even understand .it is why , `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn factswhen students , must learn facts without knowing what they are talking or learning about , mean nonsense at all .i agree that a fact is important but if they do nt know why it has happened it wo nt be necessary for them to learn that because the day after , it would be off their minds .usually , things that you learn at school must help you for the future , so if a student learn the fact before the understanding , he will not use this information again in his future .consequently , it s better to understand an idea and a concept , because when you understand something it will be print much longer in your mind that you thought .when an idea is understood , the brain will stock the information because this idea could be useful for another time .a concept or an idea are exactly the same and they work together .first you understand the idea and then when you know it you can imagine the concept more easily .a student will learn more in defining and understood an idea or concept than just learn a fact .otherwise , sometimes facts are important in a way that they have a relation with real facts in a sense of natural events .for example , when on bbc news they introduced the tsunami event , everybody was shocked but they learnt something before they understood why . ..finally , i will say that the best for a student will be to understand first the idea , imaginate it and finally learn it .
