i agree that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .i support this statement for several reasons first of all there is the durability of the product in the market .this means that if i can sell a product in a mass production way there is the need of lowering the cost of manufacturing in order to generate more money .which in turn means using bad quality products .in return there is a significant investment in the marketing in order to be sold .another reason why products seem better in advertisment is because of technological advancements .the use of several computer progrmas such as illustrator , photoshop and others have the possibilty of accenting in different ways the beauty of the product being advertised .for example a macdonald commercial of a cheese burger , the size , the look of the ingredients everything is exagerated .this also means being able to potray an unreal vision of what the product is .thirdly , competition , because the same product is sold by different parties the best visual statement made is the one that is going to sell the most , even though the product could be the same .it is important to say that although this is a common marketing strategy people should be aware of this manipulation .specially by being well informed of the product being advertised in order to judge not only visually , the quality of the product .a company decision to use advertisment exagertion to sell their product protrays a lack of respect towards the buyer .and it is our responsability to regulate as buyers such manipulations
