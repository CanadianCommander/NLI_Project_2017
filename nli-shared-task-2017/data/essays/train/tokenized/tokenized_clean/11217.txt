some people think that studying a wide variety of subjects is a waste of time , and that one should concentrate on one s major .of course studying hard about one s majors is important .but learning other subjects , which might seem at times unrelated to one s major , is just as important , especially in institutions of higher education like universities .i will introduce my own experience to illustrate my point .i am an art major , studying to become a professional artist .i could have just been content with the technical training and painting classes that the art college provided .they did help a lot to improve my creative skills .but i `` wandered off  to the realm of art history .at first it was because i wanted to learn about how the great artists of the past created their works .but as i studied on , not only did i learn about the history of visual culture , but how artworks could be seen from a historian s point of view , and inside the cultural , historical , and social context .i also took a lot of elective courses in literature .these classes showed me how beauty and self-expression could be achieved through words .i was provided with a chance to compare how literature was different from the art form created with color and form .it made me think deeper about what painting was really about : what its characteristics were , and just what it was that could be done only through painting and through no other form of art .although art history and literature had nothing to do with the actual painting process , they both helped me try to produce a better , deeper painting .art history opened my eyes to the fact that artworks could be received from a various points of view .literature classes made me think seriously about the essence of painting , my major .in conclusion , widening one s scope in academic interests not only results in becoming more informed but also in opening one s eyes to a wider perspective .moreover , one can understand one s major better by studying other subjects , rather than restricting oneself in one s specified field .
