nowadays , advertisement is a world-wide phenomenon that tends to pry even in our privacy .in my opinion , it seems obvious that most advertisements try to make products appear better than they really are .to begin with , we must not forget that business is business .then , no matter how despicable the means are , the sole purpose is to make money .that is why ads always bludgeon the would-be customer into buying something .to do so , ads are expected to attract people s attention at all costs .moreover , advertisements often convey the picture of an ideal and perfect world .for instance , as far as the clothing industry is concerned , we all have seen ads showing sculptural bodies wearing marvellous garments !unfortunately , the average citizen does not look like the models so he or she feels quite frustrated .giving a product a better appearance than its real one turns out to be an unwholesome way to convince the customer to buy something .to a certain extent , this phenomenon is linked to the kind of brainwashing people experience under totalitarian regimes , namely it tries to put everyone ine the same single mold without taking care of individuals .you have to be careful if you do not want to be influenced and this requires a great amount of self-control .one solution could lie in education : we should teach children how to have their own opinions in spite of what is shown to them .this could probably prevent such dangerous drifts ( if this kind of advertising was not so efficient it would have certainly been abandoned ! ) .thus , we may affirm that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .by no means must we forget that the main purpose is to make profit so we would rather try not to be influenced .i think that it could be much better if enough safety nets were established but you know : every law has a loophole !
