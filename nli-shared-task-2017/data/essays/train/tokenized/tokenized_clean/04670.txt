i would strongly agree with this statement .in today s learning environment , a student needs to focus on qualitative learning as opposed to quantitative learning .a need for comprehension of the concepts and ideas becomes increasingly important for a person to achieve success in his/her life .as a child , benjamin franklin was relieved of studying at junior school since he would not learn up everything that he was required of him , which he believed it to be unnecessary as they were already provided .he went on to later become one of the greatest inventors of all time .now i am do not believe that school is not important , but that these ` facts  , which are merely clusters of information , are actually derived from ideas that other people once had .once a concept is understood , the idea can always be derived .once a theorem is known , a derivation can be made .in contrast , if a student is made to only learn facts with lesser importance given to ideas , then that student may not be able to contribute to many aspects that require thinking in his life .if everyone were taught to do something but not told why it is done or what principle underlies it , then innovation would become an extinct concept .i would next like to highlight another important result - innovation .it is the only thing that has given us what we have today ; this pc that i am operating on , the ets testing system and countless other things .complacency would really bring us back to the stone age .in conclusion , if we were to only learn facts and figures , then we would not require schools in the first place .everyone would be academically equal or based on the capacity of his/her memory , which would be a large encumberance to progress .this is the reason that all universities stress on concept learning than ` mugging up  .to conclude , i would say that this statement is perfectly right and that it should prevail .
