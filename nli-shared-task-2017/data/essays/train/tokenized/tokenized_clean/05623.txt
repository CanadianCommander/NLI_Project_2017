if one wants to be successful in business , one needs to take some risks and try new ideas or concepts .however , successful people can not limit themselves to what they already know as their environment is evolving in parallel .they need to constantly adapt and can not only focus on what they already know how to do well .therefore , they need to learn and try new things .in a business , this becomes very obvious with the illustration of the development of the business .for instance , bill gates ( microsoft ) originally provided operating systems .nowadays his firm also provides antivirus , new environment ( .net ) and so on .everytime he introduces a new product on the market , there is an underlying risk related to different uncertainties : how the product will be received , the quality of the product . ..however , if one starts something totally new , one needs to have enough knowledge to control the situation and anticipate upcoming problems .at least , one needs to ensure that knowledge and information are within their reach when needed .on the one hand , steve jobs ( easyjet ) shows that entrepreneurship and motivation can be enough to become successful but there is no guarantee .he created easyjet based on a simple concept : cheap flights .on the other hand , the disappearance of ten per cent of small and medium enterprises , five years after being created , shows that the risks must be measured and calculated .indeed , trying new things is not enough , there must be a follow up and a constant evaluation of the risk to prevent from failure .to conclude , successful people need to have an initial idea .as the environment is evolving , the initiators will need to consider new areas they might not know well in order to have their ideas fit in this environment .thus they will have to try new things and take risks , but they will not take blind risks .
