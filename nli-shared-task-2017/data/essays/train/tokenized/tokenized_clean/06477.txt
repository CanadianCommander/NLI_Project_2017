the issue at hand is whether students are supposed to know ideas and concept or to know only facts .even though some people consider memorizing facts is more important , i agree with the statement , which means that understanding ideas and concepts are more important .first , i would like to discuss it by using specific academic subjects .for physics , some teachers think that students should learn only formula , ie facts , not basic concepts .last year i had a teacher who belives in this way and i was miserably confused .as the formula of physics seem to be identical , i could not figure out what formulae i was required to use in the exam .as a result , my grade was terrible .however , this year , my teacher has taught me the fundamental concept of physics and how each formula came form .this time , i could handle formula and succeeded in the exam .from this reason , i strongly believe that understanding ideas is extremely prominent and vital .furthermore , it is essential to learn concepts because leaning and memorizing facts are just pain .in my opinion , to learn something is to deepen one s knowledge by having fun .if people are encouraged to memorize facts and not to learn basic ideas , they will likely to dislike studying .on the other hand , if they are supposed to learn concept , they will be able to know the way a thing is and realize how much learning can be fun .for instance , learning histroical facts are boring .nevertheless , understanding why the event happened is a really attractive method to approach history .in other words , memorizing what happended during the world war ii is not fun , but understanding why this happened is extremely interesting .in this manner , understanding ideas and concepts is suited to my opinion .
