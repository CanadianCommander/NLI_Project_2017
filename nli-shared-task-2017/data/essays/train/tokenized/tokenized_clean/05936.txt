advertising is a way of selling a product in the market .people see the lucrative advertisements and are tempted to buy the product but in reality most advertisements make products seem much more better then they really are .the products reliabilty should depend on its composition , use and results .firstly , an advertisement may make us believe much more then the product really is .its composition may be the same as any other product in the market which is not advertised .like we may buy cosmetics from loreal as they are very well advertised , though they may be equivalent to any other local company cosmetics .this is what advertising does .secondly , advertising makes us use the product based on assumptions that the advertisements make about those products .it s only after continuous use that we can make out whether the product is good or not .most of the brand names which are in the market now are because people find out the assumptions made by the advertising companies are true and many products after long term use were found to be contaminated and did not work the same way as advertised and they disappear from the market completely or for some time till they are up to the standards .example , cocacola was banned in india because it was found contaminated with harmful pesticides .thirdly , its the result over the period of the time that determine the reliability of the product .either scientific result or after certain time of use by the consumers the relaibilty of the product can be known .any assumptions made by the advertising company is a means to sell the product and should be considered only a market trend .therefore , one should keep in mind that advertising is the means of selling products and what it says is not hundred percent true .its only the composition , use and the result of the use that determine the reliability of the product .
