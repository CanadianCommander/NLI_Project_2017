people living in modern times have benefited from many inventions and discoveries that have enriched the world .dedicated scientists even devote their life time in order to explore different ways to make our lives better .when exploring the subjects , these people do not hesistate to rake risks and evolve their projects rather than only doing what they are familiar with or know how to do very well .there is one important question that should be asked .why do people need to try new things and take risks ?i strongly believe that people , who are or want to be successful , do take risks and try new things instead of concentrating on their every day subjects , since repeating everyday knowledge and not questioning their current involvements would not be heplful and enough to make them successful people .first , when i consider about people who had left important prints on the history with the different ascpects and various subjects of science , literature and arts , i can reach a conclusion that almost all of these important figures were filled with the motivation of becoming successful and they took risks to achieve their targets .for example , the nobel laurette economist james tobin says that ` rare is the child who wants to grow up to be an economist or a professor , i myself did . ...although being grown up in a village and very poor family , prof. tobin did not easily give up his dreams and inspite of her father s rejections , he decided to study economics instead of working as a farmer , which was the thing he was very familiar with and even he was very good at .without giving up his dreams and by taking some risks such as failures and financial difficulties that he experienced in the time period of his education , he continued his studies passionately and became a worlwide known economist .finally , he was awarded with a nobel prize in 1982 , which is a strong evidence of his success .second , when people are just concentrate on the subjects and works , which they are very familiar with , then they may loose their desire to be successful since there is an huge possibility to think that they have already achieved enough knowledge so why to struggle more and try new things .in conclusion , i strongly believe that there are yet more to exlpore and more to develop also question all around of the world to make the future brighter and better for next generations .in order to make an epoch and not only have a solid contribution to the social world we live in but also to be successful , people should be able to take risks and they should not be just depended on the subjects they already know .
