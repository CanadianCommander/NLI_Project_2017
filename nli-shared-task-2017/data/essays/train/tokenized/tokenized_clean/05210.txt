i totally disagree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i strongly feel that this statement is being made by a novice person who actually do nt refers to the weekly reports and tabloids as published by the bussiness sector regularly .now a days a car signifies much more things than to be a mere vehicle to carry out the routine transportation .it has become an indespensible commodity like television and telephones .as compared to the primitive era , now a days people keep more than one car at their disposal marked seperately for their well defined purpose .because of the rapid expansion in bussiness sector , the increasing distances do nt actually matter any more for the working class .there are majority of people who are working at the companies located at quite a large distance .in that case , they prefer taking their private vehicles such as cars , for commuting .it makes them feel more comfortable and save their time as well .as recently being concluded through a survey , most of the people feel that owing a car is always a better deal than owing a two wheeler as the former is more safe and secure .according to few , cars are always faster than any other two wheeler and comfortable also .one can drive them in almost any climatic conditions .they are also less subjected to the unconditional accidents such as slippage and skidding .it also helps them to avoid irritating pollution on the way .some people also considers car as their status symbol .the larger the car , the higher recoginition they can manage to beg in the society .in my own society i could see that there were merely 20 cars five years back .but now the situation has come up to the extent that the parking place can be seen always flooding , with cars of almost all types being parked all over .the recent boom in the manufacturing sector has blessed us with the advancement of the technology .the spare parts are now available at much cheaper rates than ever .the car manufacturing companies are also devising many ways to produce economical cars which can be afforded by almost every sector of the society .such cars consumes less fuel and are specially desingned keeping in mind the general ergonomics for people driving every day .with all such efforts in place , i really do nt feel that the number of cars in use will going to decline in the years to come .rather we would be able to see some really sophisticated and less resource intensive models on the roads in the coming years .last but not the least , i feel that the statement is simply based on the subjective knowledge and lacks the pragmatic approach considerably .
