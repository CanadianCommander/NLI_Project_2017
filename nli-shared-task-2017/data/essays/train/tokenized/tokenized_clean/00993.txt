i agree with understanding ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .in the beginning of the contemporary period , people tand to teach and learn a marerial in a easy way to accept .however , this method of way to reach ideas restricted the flexibility of thinking .learnig only facts is the same as learnig skill .students must learn how to use a skill instead of maintain a state of having skill .historically admirous teacher socrates taught his student to think them selves and find the facts or answers through their thoughts .in the example of eignstain , he could not fit into public school .however , he found out the facts and inventied many products through his flexible ideas .next , learning facts also influence to a person s self-esteem .learning at school means the same idea with solving a proplem for student .students will experience of great achivement through solving problem .this is the process to fully understand ideas of the study .through that experience students will lemost of people know one plus one is two .however , before learn concept of how it works , they can not explain that it is a real fact .now it is the era of imagine and dream .without new ideas and concepts , not only people but also society can not develope .
