as science and technology develops , societies burden people with a huge amount of knowledge .an important question arises for each individual , when he tries to build an amount of knowledge for himself : is it better for him to concentrate on a subject and has a unified knowledge on that subject , or is it better for him to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i think , it is better to choose a subject and concentrate on its details .first , during my undergraduate years , i tried take classes from as broad subjects as i can .i took economy , physics , classical ballet , history of science and german litretare courses as my elective courses .in this way , i have gained knowledge on each of these subjects .but i could study each of them for at most two successive semesters .that s why i could gain only a little information on each of them .now i still have curiosity to further improve my knowledge on many of these topics , but i could not have time and energy to accomplish such a great task .second , the number of academic subjects increases in an incredible speed .what is called broad today , will not even be enough tomorrow .and the amount of knowledge that has to be gained on a topic in order to have an idea of it will also increase as time passes .so , it is also very diffucult to develop a good and broad knowledge of various academic topics .last , but not the least is that , a person is required to find a job to survive .so , he has to have adequate knowledge in one specific subject in order to be able to work on this subject .and it will be better for him to concentrate on the topic he works on .all in all , to have a broad knowledge of many subjects seems attractive .however , it may be an impossible goal to achieve .
