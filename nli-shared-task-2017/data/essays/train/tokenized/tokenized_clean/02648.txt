i think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching the ideas and concepts .nevertheless , the education systems are generally based on teaching the ideas and the concepts .the ideas of famous people and the some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime .i think this system will not work in near future .because of the technological improvemets , the students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world .thus , they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts .they will deal with the issues which they really exist .they will give more importance to the occurences .i think it would be better when the students learn the facts , after that they can find fundamental idea behind this fact and the students both learn two issues by analyzing the facts .if this system is formed , the students begin to laern the issues by experiencing the living facts .the drawbavk of teaching the ideas and concepts is craeting an abstract education for the students .the student may never encounter with these ideas or concepts in their lifetime .however the facts are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these facts .all the students will be adult in near future and will face with these facts .if they meet the facts in their school years , this experience enable them to cope with woes easily .another essential benefit of teaching facts is improving the attention of the students .the examples of real world will arouse their attention and i think they will want to participate the debates about the occurences .this system increse the efficieny of education , the other system is so bored in respect of this one .because the students only memorize the ideas an concepts
