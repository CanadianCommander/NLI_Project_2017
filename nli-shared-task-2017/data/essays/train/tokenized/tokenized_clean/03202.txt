yes i agree with above conversation that student have concept than learn facts .its important that student know about any topic the concept is importants than learn facts .at first i want to distinguish between to two facts .if the student has concept he can have that knowledge or subject related to this knowledge lifelong .if the student had learned any fact it will not stored in his memory and he can not remember it so long time .if student had concept he can explain the related concept anywhere at anytime .the ideas and concept generated by the student will be remembered as much as long time than the learned fact .if student builts a concept on related matter on his own ideas it will be very useful for him future .student builted topic is related to his job then it will play a major role of life and he can settled in his life and knowledge about related topic will be improve his efficiency in his job also .due to this the student can well score or remember about that topic .but where as in learned facts the student can remember much time about the topic .the student who based on the leaned fact has book knowledge or theory knowledge .theory knowledge will not will stored in the memory for so much time .here i want to say my opinion , that is practical knowledge is much more better than theory knowledge .by learning the topic it cant remembered so much time and it is very useful only for those students in exam point of view .the practical knowledge is well remembered and it can explained to his junior students also where as theory knowledge can not remembered by the persom after the exam is completed .for example let us take mathmatics subject .in this subject the whole matter is based on problems only .here only some formulas can remembered by the person or student .the problem should be solved on basis of that formula related one .if the student will learned the problem it can not remember by that him so long time .if he built the ideas on the problem he can remember the problem for long time .here in this subject it is improved that practical knowledge or concept of students are well efficiect than theory or learned knowledge .in my opinion concept is better than the theory or learned knowledge .
