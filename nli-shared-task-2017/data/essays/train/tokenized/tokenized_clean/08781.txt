all the people known that if people want to be success they must try a lots of new things and also the people should take risks .if only doing things that they already know , the people should not be success or maybe make long time get successful .first , successful people try new things and take risks can make them work hard .successful people expecilly young like try new things to attack them concentrate , so they want discover or know the new things whick others do nt know that .if they interest that , the successful people must be work hard than other time , that s good for them carneer .second , if successful people like risks , they can improve them make more money for their business .if some people like stock , only the people have enough money and experiences , it s not enough , people also should like challageing , so people can get succesful than before .finally , though successful people would like try new things and take risks , but sometimes it s not good for their heathy .most people only work in office , they do nt like do the sport and do more exercise , that really a big problem in the society .i think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .that s why some peolpe can get success .
