i do agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how t6o do well  .to agree , there many reasons to say .for example , a scientist allways think better to invent something else that he observes .if he thinks to do that he knows well he wo nt be able to discover new things .he always concentrate on new things that may be a task of risk .in that way he may fail for the first time but later he may get sucessin that aspect .the other way is that many great people get sucess aftter taking risks in particular aspect .if we go on doing what we know well , we may get sucess in that particular aspect but we ca nt see other part of life .we are good at one aspect but poor at other aspects .a sucess after a hard work & included with risks gives more happyness than that we are expert in that .i does nt mean that do only risks , but just try to do such type of things sometimes .to do a work one should have the basic knowledge of it .then only he can move on .so , i finally conclude that people who try to do new things & think in a different way may get more sucessin their career .not only scientists , many other people are getting popular by having this type of nature .now a days students are discoverring many things by their own by thinking in a different way .so , their teachers should guide them in this aspect .this help their future
