some people like hold the opion that learn ideas and concepts is much important than learn facts , even though teachers and parents .but in my opion , i would prefer that learn facts is more important than just learn ideas and concepts .beacuse the facts can be clearly and deeply unserstand that what is the real thing .firstly , facts are more clearly unserstand when you learn something .if you learn facts that makes you really clearly about the article , you can know about the heart of the article .ideas and concepts just points in the articl or news when you learn in the classroom .for example , when you first see the articl or news which you will find main ideas and expalin points .you just learn about the face .you just learn how to write a normal writing .also like the words and some beautiful sentences .in the classroom , some theachers just teach about consistant .what is article , how to write article , remember the beautifu words and sentences .sencondly , did you know what is author what to say ?it s not ideas , concepts and beautiful words .the articls just want people understands that what they want say , which is the most important problems in the world .some articl is writing about that they want people pay attention the problem .but they did nt pay attention about the article s sprit .and if you understand facts which you will learn more abou the article , it s make depply for you understand the article .in sum of , you must cleal  rly and depply
