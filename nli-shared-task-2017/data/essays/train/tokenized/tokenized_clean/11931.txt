there is a statement here about being successful .it says : successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i want to express my opinion by giving examples from real life ; first , look at ataturk s life .he attempted to save his country with his friends and at the end of the war he achieved it .indeed it was not a new thing .there are , exactly , similar conditions and successes in turkish and world history .but after the war he tried to found a new country which is governed by citizens ( although this term was new for the turkey in those days ) and try to bring democrasy culture here .after all of these , he is remembered as succesful man and a leader .in conclusion , i can say that trying new things and taking risks can help you to be succesful .but . ..in the twentieth century businessmen found a new business strategy : frenchising .there are lots of chains of companies and you just contact with them , giving them amount of money which they determined and you can be successful in this way .that is a way of success without taking risk and without finding new things .after these instances how can i conclude ?and do i have to ask this question : what is success ?to answering these questions is not easy but i want response in my way ; if you just want to be successful person who lives in high standarts you do not have to take risks .but if you want to be a successful person who will be remembered untill the end of time you must take risks , you must find new solutions to old problems .at the end , i just can say that i agreed the statement and i have to add that at the same time i disagreed it .i hope i profess it well .
