i am now 23 years old and if you notice i am from an economy that has held itself even after the national fabric threatens to break down every second day .something or the other just keeps happening in this nation of millions .what has given birth to this never say die attitude ?the normal conclusion will be that its the new generation that holds in its hands the reigns of a powerful and majectic nation .the pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngsters are responsible for its community .i totally disagree to the statement ` that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .i am of the same genre that we talk about here .i would ask how have i not served my community ?i have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college , who had forced me to do it ? , nobody .the reason why i did it is the fact that i think i am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level .infact i felt that this is the least i could do to help those who are less fortunate than me .as a rule i do nt believe in giving alms , i feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work .that is what i do , i work , i contribute to the economy , i work , i pay my taxes on time , i have the will to see that my abilities are used to the fullest so that i grow , in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow .if somebody feels that i stiil have not contributed enough to my community then i must add that my community holds adults and children .i love and respect both .not only do i spend time with them , i stimulate others to spend time with them too .as an onset i would finish with the statement that i do contribute to my community and i am still counted amongst ` young people  .i will continue doing this because i do nt have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum i can do to make people who matter to me more special .
