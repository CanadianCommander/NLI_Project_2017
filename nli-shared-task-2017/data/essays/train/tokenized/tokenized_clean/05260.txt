in essence , i totally agree that a broad span of knowledge of many subjects is better than specialization in one subject .a broad knowledge span of many academic fields contributes to the overall scholarly status , or level of education , of a person .the world we live in revolves around everything we can perceive from science to literature to general knowledge .for example , a physicist who can only talk about physics and the very technical areas of his field of study is , at least to me , very difficult to be called a scholarly person .it is true that he may excel in his own field of specialization but he will find it to earn respect from people in the society in general , partly because his lack of knowledge of ` other  subjects implicitly implies his disregard for the people engaged in these ` other  subjects .to me , this physicist can not be called an educated person .in my opinion , no one field of specialization can evolve and flourish solely on its own .after all , whatever ideas , however abstract , that are involved in that field are developed and perceived by human beings who live in the real world that comprises of all different things .it is inevitable that even the most abstract of ideas in one field should have the slightest association to another idea most likely in another field .since these can be linked in some way or another , it is apparently condusive to know other fields in order to see these links and perhaps also to better the field of specialization .another advantage of a broad knowledge span is different approaches and perspectives to viewing a problem .different academic areas implement different ways of thinking about problems .for example , maths mainly adopts logic and reasoning , while literature may use a more elegant and artistic style to viewing the world .realizing this should make a person more flexible in solving problems in general and better understand the things around us , or concepts in his field of specialization , in multiple perspectives .the above re-emphasizes the fact that single specialization is not desirable .
