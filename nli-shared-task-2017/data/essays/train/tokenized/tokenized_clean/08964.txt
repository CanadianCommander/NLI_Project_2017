first of all i would like to write that i am in complete agreement with the statement .let me say some of the reasons that support my decision : since there are more innovations and new thing coming in , the young peolpe spend their time doing things that in the near future do not contribute with the development of their community .as an example i would like to say some examples about what the young peolple of my country do at the moment and what the young peolple did before .i remembered when i was at the school , the teachers took us to different places of the city in order to do social activities with the poor people , we braught them food , toys , clothes , and it was really satisfactory for all of us .in addition to all this activities , at the end of the school , i mean in the last year , we had to do a social project whit the community and it was a part of the grades at the end of the year , but anyway we did that for other reasons ... `` help the people  .however , after to have finished the school , i still carry on with this kind of activities and some of friends also do that yet .on the other hand , when i look at the young people now , i get surpriesed how the life change and how the activities that we used to do it before do not exist right now .what the zoug people are interested in ? ...go to the disco , play x/box , playstation , internet , watching t.v , etc. and some others activities that do not contribute with the integral formation of the person .i think that much of the behaviours the young people have , are coming from the rapidly change of the world .however we can not forget that we do not live alone , we live with other people that probably need our help and we have not realised yet . .
