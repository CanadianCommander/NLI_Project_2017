as far as i am concerned , the best way to travel is free tour .in other words , i think not planned tour will give us more pleasant experience .you may argue that the group tour led by an adept tour guide can show us more things to see and feel , but it is just a second-hand experience just given away to our hand by another person .in my case , i am planning new york tour after two weeks .i ve saved my spare pocket money and earned money from part time jobs for two years .i prepared sightseeing visa and flight tickets just on my own without any help from tour agency .it gave me a self-confidence that i can do anything for myself .it was a little bit hard job to prepare document for applying visa and cheapest flight ticket , but i think it reserved thing to do .you can save your time to prepare your travel with agency and skillful guide , but you can not get a experience to do something on your own .moreover , self planned travel can gives you a great experience differ from a group tour have to obey time table scheduled by tour agency or gude .the people who went to trip with guide can see famous tourist attractions and get a same memory with others , but tourist without guide will go anywhere want to go even if it was not a planned thing to do .the plan-less trip can give us real freedom because no plan is our plan .i think many tourist commit oblivion to get freedom .our own intend to travel is feel free and experience exotic culture , but many group tour is not available to feel freedom but just crammed exotic culture .therefore i think travel with no guide will be better for our independence and more experience .
