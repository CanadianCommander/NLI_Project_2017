i agree with the statement , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .maybe to learn facts is important to students .but i think if they understand ideas and concepts , they will get facts , too .i think to understand ideas and concepts are more easy to understand , instead of just learn facts .when i study the biology , and history in english , my tutor always gives me an examples , and ideas .and it is always helpful to me , and i will never forget about it .for the foreign language students , the ideas and examples are helpful .because they can not understand the english well as americans do , they could not just learn facts from the books .so , the ideas or concepts are very important to them to learn facts .to understand ideas and cocepts are more fun to do .if students get ideas , concepts , and examples on the picture , they can understand more clearly .to draw pictures or diagrams , students will have fun in the class .it is like laboratory in the biology class .the laboratory exercise is so much fun , and students can get main ideas of what they are studying .i think the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.  is true .if teachers and students can learn lessons together , and if the lessons are fun , students would like to go to school and they would like to learn in the school .
