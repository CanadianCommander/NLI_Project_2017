i think it is difficult to have a categoric response to this statement because i think it depens on the people .but , i have to agree or disagree with this statement , so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .first , young people are `` young  !it implies a kind of unknowledge of life .they do not have experiences and do not know the end of the situations they live ( in general ) .so , as they do know anything , they enjoy more for each situation .moreover , they sometimes think that this situation could maybe never more happens , so they enjoy the present moment .although when you are older , you have a certain experience of life .as you have been young , you had a lot of experiences in the past , and you know the end of each one .so , i think older people do not take time to enjoy life when it is possible because they already live it .futhermore , i think young people have generaly a good health ( better than older people ) .so , they have the possibility to do more things than older people .this good health help young people to take risk without doubts or questions .if a young people want to jump , he jumps !and he does not have the worry of the others .moreover , young people enjoy life because they feel free .they do not have problems at work , or family s affairs . ..only one thing counts : themselves .this feeling of freedom helps them to be more spontanous or happy .the innoncence of the child stay in each person but is less present in the older people mentality as the young one .young people have this child s spirit that the older people lose with the years .but finally , i think that older people in appearence can be young people inside .sometimes , older people enjoy life more than young people because of the death which can be near for them .so , they enjoy day as if it was the last .life is too short , and had to be enjoy every day !!!
