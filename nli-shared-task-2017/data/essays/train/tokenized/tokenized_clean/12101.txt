people learned a lot of kinds of knowledge in thier schools .education is neccesary points for all people to having good life .there are many controvercial topics about school and teaching methords .the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn fact  is also big topic in education .i have studied since i was child , and i have expelienses of many kinds of teaching methord .from my experience , i agree this idea i think that teachers can not teach everything , education gives ability to think .first , teachers can not teach everything .in the school , there are time limitations .it impossible for students to learning everything in that school .for example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years .do they know everything about nursing ?i do not think so .knowledge that students receive in the nursing college is just basic knowledge .in addition , knowledge are changed as research is done .in hospitals , nurses need to study nursing in depth in the critical area ; nursing methords are changing everyday .therefore , i think that teachers can not teach every facts in the school ; students need to understabd ideas and concepts .lately , education gives ability to think : how to deal with a situation , how to solve that problem .if students only understanded facts , they could not solve a different situation .however , if students know the concepts or ideas , they could use those concepts to fit the situations .in nursing , nurse care a lot of kinds of patients : differents age , gender , disease , race and culture .if nurses know concept of nursing care , they would change their nursing care that fit patients  conditions .if nurses did not understand the idea , they could not provide good nursing care , and patients would not have good outcome .i think that facts show people one situation .yet , ide and concepts give us a lot of possibility .in the education , teachers are not able to teach everything .students can not deal with different situation if they only know the facts .therefore , i agree that statemnt .
