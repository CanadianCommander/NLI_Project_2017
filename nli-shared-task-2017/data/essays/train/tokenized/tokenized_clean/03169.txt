i will agree with the argument that it is much more important for the students to understand the gist of the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .it is obvious that students will not spend their entire life at school .eventually , they will graduate and will work in environments where they will need to apply the ideas and concepts they learned at school .in order to be successful in their professional life , it is crucial for them to absorbe the material that they are given at school such as ideas and concepts .a student in international affairs major must know realism , liberalism and the theories behind it .he/she has to know how communism has emerged , what lied beneath it .how it differs from liberalism ?what constructivism means ?how it relates the current school of thoughts ?knowing the facts will not solely help the students to analyze what the real situation brings .it is not argued here that learning facts is not important and students do not need them .it is obviously important .ideas and concepts should definitely be applied to facts , meaning real world situations .without applying the theories to factual incidents , learning concepts will be useless and meaningless .however , without understanding the gist of the theories , students will encounter hardships in analyzing real world situations .without knowing what liberalism is and what it brings to the countries , a student will not be able analyze completely the certain facts that he/she faces in professional life .another point to mention is , ideas and concepts do not change abruptly .it usually takes a certain period of time for an idea to evolve and to find credence .but facts change all the time .an issue that is important today may differ tomorrow .a student has to update his/her knowledge to keep up with the agenda .and without having the fundamental background , a student will not achieve success in analyzing new facts .to say the least , i agree with the statement that it is much more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts than just learning facts .ideas and concepts do not change
