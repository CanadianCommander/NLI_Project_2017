i am agree with this statement and there are several reasons in my opinion ;first , young people thinks differently than older because they do nt have the same way of thinking .young people are not self consencious , they often prefer playing instead of work at school . ..they do nt have the same p more they often do nt have responsability like work to win money and to live in good conditions , keep their children . ..that s whythen , young people are not responsable yet , contrary to their parents for exemple .generally they do nt have children .so they often go in the club , go to the party with friends . ..but we can say the contrary because sometimes , older people are enjoying life more than younger .for exemple , when they finished to work , they often decide to make a trip , travel , do their garden , cooking . ..they profite to realize some hobbies .because they won money during her life
