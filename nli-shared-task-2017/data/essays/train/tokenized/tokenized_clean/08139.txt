traveling in a group with a tour guide , a way of taking a trip with a group of people with one guide attached , is an effective way of traveling for the people who do nt know well about the region .however , since this way of travelling restricts the personal freedom and chances to meet the local people , it is certain that traveling in indiviual is a better way of traveling .when traveling in a group , you have to respect other people , and travel the region according to the guide s plan .because of that , even if you really like one place and wants to stay more in the place , you get no luxury to choose whether to move to the other place or to stay in one place .a good example of this is when you visit louvre museum in paris as a group .since louvre museum is a gorgeous museum that needs more than a day to see everything , because of the tour guide s schedule , you have to move to the other place when the time is up , and some tour guides set the time for the louvre museum for only few hours , making travellers impossible to see many things from the museum .on the other hand , traveling in individual grants travelers the most freedom .the one traveling alone can choose to stay in one region as long as their time allows , and also can skip a place according to his will .for instance , when an individual traveller finds the louvre museum very interesting , he can choose to spend few days for the museum , skipping his chances to see the other places , such as the versailles palace .due to that , the person can make and adjust his own schedule to achieve the best pleasure in given time .not only achieving freedom , but travelling as an individual can give travellers chance to meet many local people .some people might claim that travelling as an individual can make the person unable to find the places that the person wants to go .however , travelling is not just about seeing places and take pictures .true meaning of travelling is feeling cultures of places , and meet people and communicate with them .by doing that , the person can widen his/her view about the world .furthermore , if a person can not reach to the place because he does nt know the way , then he can ask local people using his body languages and gestures .by doing that , even though the trip might be a little tougher , but the trip will be more meaningful and will help the person to grow mentally .many people tend to travel in group because of the various reasons .one might decides to travel in group because he/she has no time to plan for his own trip .one might decides to travel in group because he ca nt speak the language of the region .however , despite of all the disadvantages of travelling alone , travelling individually will help you to understand better about the culture as well as widening your viewpoints about the world .due to that , it is certain that travel as an individual is the best way to travel .
