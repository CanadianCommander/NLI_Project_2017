today , many technological advances are being made to reduce the pollution emitted by cars .the gas from the muffler tips of automobiles have caused a serious amount of air pollution , but nonetheless , i believe that cars will maintain their numbers after 20 years .to start , techonology has made cars much more `` green  , that is to say they are less harmful to the environment .green cars will evetually replace the modern gasoline or diesel powered automobiles , which will lead to cleaner air .as more and more efficient techonologies make their appearances under the hood of our cars , we will all be driving a car that does little or no harm .but , we are not going to get rid of our cars .for example , in the u.s. it is pretty much impossible to live without a car .why ?it s because due to the large amount of land , everything is spaced out nicely enough , but in unwalkable distances .next , when 2026 rolls along , the advent of flying autombiles , jet-packs , etc will make it to the door of some people .in other words , those who can afford those high-tech gadgets .jetpacks and flying cars might reduce the number or cars , but how many people will own such ?very little .the lucky few might fly around town , but the majority of us will be driving on route 95 on our new all-hybrid civic .so , technology will bring about a slight decline to the number of cars , but still not enough for us to notice the difference during our everyday commute .however , this is nt to say that the number of cars will stay the same or decline just a little .if technology keeps on advancing at a rapid pace , i believe that we will have invented a new form of transportation that is far more efficient than the autombiles we drive today or the ones we drive in 20 years .if this is the case , then the decline in the number of cars is a thing that we all can look forward to .in summary , i would say that a lot of factors will contribute to the decline or incline in the number of cars .the real situation that we will incounter is something we wo nt find out until it is at our doorsteps .regardless of techonological improvement rates , i am sure that there will be at least a small decline in the number of automobiles .if there is no decline , at least we are going to be able to live without worrying that the exhaust from our car is going to create a hole in the ozone layer .
