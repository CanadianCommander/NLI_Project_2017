everyday in our lives we can see products  advertisements and spots almost everywhere we go .they are specifically studied to attract us , to steal our attention , thus making us think about them even for few seconds , even if we do nt need what they are advertising .to do so they have to be direct , colorful , funny .everything they are advertising must appear beautifull , amazing , of great use or even really tastefull .so yes , i basically agree with the statement , and we can often have evidence of it .for example - a really common one - we see on tv or on a paper something advertising something to eat , it seems wonderfull , hot , tasty and it also has a low price !i have at least to try it .when we go to buy it , we can see it is half the size it seemed and it is not even that tasty .advertisements can influence a lot your thoughts .not to talk about kids .if they see a toy on tv , it s shown colorfull and huge .they need to buy it .what i said works the best with foods , toys , something uncommon or that we do nt usually see .items used in our everyday life can not be shown to much better than they are , because we know them , we know how they work and what they can and can not do .the base idea to advertise something is to make it appear fantastic .if you want to sell it it must appear fantastic .to do so it can seem even better than it is .
