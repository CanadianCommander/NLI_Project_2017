advertisement is the channel by which a product is displayed in the eyes of the masses for increasing its sellling power to the market as well as the people .i personally feel that most advertisements are designed to effect people more than its actual worth .advertisements nowadays are based on marketing stratagies more than the quality of product itself .i have had some personal experiences where i fell for the beatifully displayed advertisements and purchased products , only to regret later .the colors , backgrounds , personal emotions and photography are enhanced to impress the people about the product .one of the experiences that made me realize that a product is much more than what it is advertized as , is when i bought diet pills by watching a television commercial .it was a 15 minute commercial where people talked about how the pill worked effectively on them and showed drastic results .it definitely worked on me emotionally and i ordered the product .it was an expensive purchase , hence expectations for the results were high .i folowed the directions and time of usage only to realize that it didnt work without diet and exercise .there was no difference in how i looked and i was extremely dissapointed .the commercials on television , radio and newspapers are made more to attract buyers , than to actually display the truth about the quality and the genuineness of the product .advanced technology and photography make products look very attractive , even to a point where advertisements are targeted to effect that part of the human brain which would get effected by the way the advertisement has been displayed .all in all , i believe advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there is always more information about the product that one needs to know besides the advertisement .the advertisements is the means to increasing the selling power of the particular product , hence only the positives will be shown .i believe that laws should be made so that the companies are complied to give the true picture about the product , the good and the bad .
