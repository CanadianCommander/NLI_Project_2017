even if we all have been once seduce by an advertisement although the product was not that good , i think that this question is more about what the real objective of advertisement is : to demonstrate the quality of an object or to give to someone the desire to buy it .as an example , i still remember an advertisement made by san orange juice company .it showed an young teenager who was coming home after playing basketball with his friend and asking to his mother where is the juice .the boy and his life looked so great that for weeks i wanted to taste it .it happens that one day , i found it in a supermarket and tasted it , of course i did not like it but the advertisment has already done its work , i had bought a bootle of it .neverthless did the advertisment lied about the juice ?not at all , it has only match with what i was wanting to see and what could make me desire the juice .that s why , i do not agree totally with the sentence as it is a bit more complicated .an advertisement must be due to a type of persons .to that group the product will seem great but to lots of other , they will not see what that advert is made for .advertisments play with a whole range of feelings that a man can feel , it can also play with confidence .by making famous person only saying they use this product and not another one they manage to sell a lot .indeed the man who is buying the product will first think as his star that this product is the bso in my opinion it is true that advertisements seem better than they are really but not totally
