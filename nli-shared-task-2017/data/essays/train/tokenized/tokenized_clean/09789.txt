when people talk about traveling , most people will want to join a group which will be led by a tour guide .i always ponder on the reason why they make such an ignorant decision .with a tour guide , one can hardly have enough time to appreciate the traveling , with a tour guid , one can no longer be free , and with a tour guid , one has to pay .in my life , my first travel was to new york and i thought of it as a horrible trip , because i was basically like a robot which was controlled by the tour guide .even buying a icecream across the street needed his permission .i knew that he did nt want any of his client be lost , but i was totally restrained under his rule .i no longer felt that i was on a trip which i was supposed to enjoy .the first monument that i visited was the liberal bell which was protected by some special glasses .with that godlike tour guide , i can hardly read any information on this bell .before having read about its derivation , i was `` told  to leave , because the bus was leaving .if i did nt have that tour i would have learned so much about this wonderful bell whille enjoying the trip .when we arrived at the hotel which we were going to sleepover tonight , i was `` told  not to leave the hotel .i felt that i was restained in this `` jail  .it was so absurd to me that i was not free on my own trip .it was not that i could not speak english and would have language barrier between the people .with this limit freedom , i could barely do anything .when i reached the end of this `` wonderful  trip , i needed to pay this guide who spoiled my trip money .the whole concept of having a tour guide is ridiculous .people may feel unsecured without having a guide but that s part of our life .nobody goes to a strange place and immediately , he knows everything .trip without a tour guide is a true vacation .one can freely walk on the street to view the wonderful city , new york .one can interact with the people on the street without any worry of time limit , and one can truely enjoy one s vacation .
