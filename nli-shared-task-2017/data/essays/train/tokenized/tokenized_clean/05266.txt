it is debatable that teenagers , these days , put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help thier communities because they are belonged to a wide range of groups and those groups participate in helping communities .in contrast , i strongly believe that students do not spend their time to helping their communities because they not only focus on more difficult exams , but also tend to become selficient .first of all , these days , a lot of difficult exams or tests make students spend more time .young people study hard to enter more prestigious universities .thus they focus on studying rather than helping their communities .according to reserch of chosun-ilbo , one of the leading newspapers in korea , a number of students who give the seats to the elder or visit the orpanage or silver house .the reserch demonstates that 70 % students respond that they do not have enough time to think about other things , instead of studying .on top of that , teenagers do not think other people whether they are poor or not .they have tendency of selfcient .in the past , many students consider their communities when communities have special party or festival for reconition of communities , so they frequently help install tools or stages .the best example of this is that my father help making stages of the rural festival of harvesting .he said that at that time , most students who lived in thier communities gave the their hands in order to succeed the festival .on the other hand , when our communities have beach festival every summer , even though our communities ask help assistance , no students emerged the cite to install stages , hence the festival failed .in this respect , at present , students are selficient compared to the past .in conclusion , young people do not spend enough time to giving thier hands for communities .the reasons are the stuends concentrate studying more to enter the better universities , and teenagers are more selficient that the past .all in all , a substantial nmber of students study at home , even though the our communities want to need the assistants of teeanagers .
