due to experiences i have made not only within my closer circle of acquaintances but also in other countries , i can agree with the statement to a certain degree .yes , many young people are not prone any more to commit themselves socially and help their community .in the time of the `` computer age  , a lot of young people find it more interesting to play computer games with americans of french than to go outside and look for people who really need help .some time ago , my school started an appeal that older , more experienced students should help younger ones to get along in critical subjects like latin or math .it can be seen as a major catastrophe that only three students acutally showed up and offered their assistance .all others used excuses like `` lack of time  or just blatantly revealed their aversion against spending time to help others .this reluctance may also be a result of the transformations many societies undergo during the process of globalization .the loss of importance of the local communites also affects the church , an institution that has always taken care of the disadvantaged members of societey and that has encouraged especially young people to help .these days , these young adults lack this encouragement and incentivement .the solution to the problem may not necessarily be to revive church as a social institution , altough this could be helpful .however , one has to use the receding to boundaries to show people where and how they can help .numerous students do not know that they are actually needed in their communities .but in the age of the internet - with which many young people spend a significant amount of time - it should not be too difficult to convey that message .everyone , from every remote location , has the possibilty to encourage young people to commit themselves in society
