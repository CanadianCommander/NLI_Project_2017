basically , i agree to this statement .to understand ideas and concepts is more complicated than just learning things by heart , and this is also what academic courses try to teach their students .being able to present own ideas is more worth than just re-producing things , like you do if you learn hard facts .that s why i think that doing research or developing or understanding ideas and concepts should rewarded higher than simply reproducing thing .science could not work without any ` thinking  , and that is what students at a school or especially at an university are supposed to learn : to get behind the things .furthermore , most facts are based upon a concept .that is an additional reason why understanding or doing science is more worth than just learning something by heart .on the other hand , it is mandatory to have a huge knowledge about simple facts in certain areas .you are not a good scientist if you do not have a huge knowledge of facts , and if you think about a lawyer , it is necessary to have both , the important , and seldom used bills in mind ( and these are a lot if you count them ) .but that does not make you a good lawyer .you have to combine this knowledge of simple facts with concepts and ideas , and these two things make you a really good lawyer .in certain areas , it might be enough to have a huge knowledge , and you do nt have to be that great thinking person .if you think about working in a library , it seems to be more important to have huge knowledge about the books which are in the archive instead of being able to understand complicated concepts or ideas .if your skills have a focus on just one thing , this will not be a key to success .to combine these two skills , being able to understand concepts and simply to learn things by heart , is a good mixture and can guarantee for good results in the job , but also in life generally .
