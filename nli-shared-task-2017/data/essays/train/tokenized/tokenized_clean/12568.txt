i am not agree with this topic because now a days there are many cars in all over the world .since the use of a car is very common for everyone because with the help of car oru working process is doing very easy so i think that the use of fewer cars will create many problems for everyone .in these days without the use of car many works will be stop and many new problems will be created .now a days when a person has it also shows his personality over to other .and in the twenty years i think that there will be more cars than now .the use of car will be common because a person use his car to go anywhere like in the party in marriage ceremony and for his personal use like for office use so in the next twenty car will be more and more common with the help of cars our petrol and fuel also safe because when we go in party with our family car is much more convinent as compared to other things to go .and the car factories are making now a days many cars day by day so in the next twenty year there are lots of cars will be availablefor different use .the cars are increasing day by day so in the next twenty year i think there will be lots of car as compared to today .now a days car is making a status symbol for every one .now a days there are many different types of cars are available in the market .there is a very big competition in the car s company so after twenty years this competition will also increase .so at the end i think after twenty years there will be many cars available if there is not then we will face many problems like we will search for another things which is more comfortable as on
