` it was in this year only that i along with several of my friends recieved tokens and certificates from the indian national service scheme the nss for the social service done , in as well as off the campus during our college life .` the young generation is trained to serve the community in one way or the other .this prompts me to strongly disagree with the notion that young people today donot give enough time to helping their communities .most of the educational dance dramas , the non government organisations involve the young generation .they are more energetic and enterprising in solving community problems .starting from schooldays itself children are taught to help older people to keep their environment clean .many school has even included this as a part of their extra curricular activities .for instance one of the schools in my locality graded students even on the way they rendered their services to the society .further the teenagers and college going students inspite of having a busy schedule and overburden of studies take out time to interact with people living in old age homes , in the nearby villages , in a nearby blind school or in the sweepers colony just next door .they acquaint themselves with the subtle problems faced by them and guide them to get a solution at their level .there are many non governmental organisations of which the younger generations form a bulk ( the working force ) like the sanskar bharti in india which serves the community through indian art and culture which is unknown to many herecontrasting to this i agree that there is a smaller lot of younger generation which has a hedonistic attitude towards life .but that can not outcast the services given by the greater lot which thinks about the communityu as well .thus i conclude that the younger generation is prepared to take the responsibility of serving the society guide by the motto service before self .it is
