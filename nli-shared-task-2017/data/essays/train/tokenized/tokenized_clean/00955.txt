i strongly disagree with this statement which says that , `` most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .there are some some reasons so that i disagree with it .the main reason is , it is law that , you have to tell everything whether it is prons or cons of the product to customer .as i talked about the law , it is the responsibility of the employer to give the right information to the customer .if they break the law and not give the right information about the product , and hide something ( defects ) to customer , customer can sue on it .if it proof in the court , they lose their licence permanently .another reason is that they lose the people s trust and it will be more important for them .so they never cheat the people whether it is advertisement or somthing else .by advertise wrong information , they make a big mistake and may be they lose thier buisness too .taking a good example of any electronics company , which produced different types of electronic equipments .suppose company advertise the computer systems .if they do nt mention the limitations with its advantages , and someone buy that computer without knowing its limitation then company has to take back , if customer not satisfied with it .sometimes some companies do these kinds of mistakes but it is out of law .so every company advertise their product without giving any false information , and this way customer make trust on the company , and they sell more and more products , and make big profit .
