i have grown up with the expression `` boys be ambitious !.i have heard it from my parents and from my teachers who always put the emphasis on studying hard to lead our nation .this is probably limited to korean social situation but this makes students focus on just their study not on helping the community or else .first of all , students in their teens which mostly consist of middle and high school students do not and can not ( due to the limited time frame ) pay much attention to the community .lack of information precipitates the problem further .if they were informed about how life is going at other side of the world , they would have cared a little more .but there are parents who always say to their children there is only one thing they have to care about , that s study and get to the prestigious university .even when i was a high school student i did nt know what was coming and going in my town area .even when i became an adult i did nt know how to participate in the community affair .these all come from the dearth of attention and care .second , unlike the system of the untied sates , we here in korea do nt have any specified rules or encouragement to make youth participate in the work of community .for example , students in the united sates actively take part in the affairs outsides of the school for the persuit of getting hands-on experience before they actually embark on landing on jobs themselves .this is faciliated by the whole atmospehere of the school students , the reason lies in the system of selecting students on the basis of egagement of social activity or voluntary work .however , we in korea can not see any benefit or incentives coming from being involved in affair outside of their school carriculum .third , the atittude and the atmosphere that the students have learned through their school years which amount to a total of 10 years or 14 years if you include university education provides the basis for the rest of their life and people still keep their old habit .it is fairly impossible for people to join the community suddenly and help the community get going .even i myself who never joined the commuity activity before do nt know how to get the information and where to look for the area that might need help or even where to start even if i seriously want to engage in a community work .in conclusion , lack of time through their school years and lack of incentives by the their targeted university and lastly ongoing habit of not being involved in a social affair prevent young people of modern times from actively taking part in the community service .starting from now , it might be helpful to encourage those young blood to care more about the community they are living in and make it a better place .
