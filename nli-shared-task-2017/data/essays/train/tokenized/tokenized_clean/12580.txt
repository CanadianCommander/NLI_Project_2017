in my think of way , it is more important for students to learn facts than to understand the ideas and concepts .there are two reasons why i believe that learing facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts .fisrt , if students dose nt know about the facts perfectly and only understand about its cincepts and ideas , they would not know what the truth is .this would make students confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood ithe concepts .they could do well accroding what they have understood about , but if it is wrong what they have understood , they would fail at the moment .second reason why i believe learning facts more important is the change of the concepts and ideas about what they learned .the concepts and ideas about an objective could change as time go on .in other words , even though it learned the right concepts and ideas when they were students , the concepts of an object could keep change depends on the social environment , so what they have know will may not ture anymore .third , understanding only concepts and ideas is less effecetive for making creative for the student .if they understand of on object s ideas already , they would believe that there is only the ideas for the object .then , they ll lose a chance to make their won ideas and opinion about the object .therefore , in my opinion , it is more important to learn facts than understand only concepts and ideas f
