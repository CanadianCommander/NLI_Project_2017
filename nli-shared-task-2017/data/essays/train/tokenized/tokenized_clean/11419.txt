today we are living in a time that the people always wants to be succesful in their job .but here the discussion is that : what do i have to do for being succesful ?can i be succesful by getting experience by doing the same work for many years or would i have to try something new and change my style ?some people prefers doing their job in the same style that they have been always doing before .they are not changing their styles so with every passing months and years , they are becoming more and more professional .they are so sure for their work and they are feeling so comfortable .but on the other hand their capacity is becoming too limited , so it is becoming harder for them to be creative in their jobs .so with the repetation of their jobs , if he has not been succesful before , it is becoming less possible for him to be succesful .so what other type of people we have here ?well there is a type who can take risks and try new things in their life .for some people it is not enough to be capable of doing one job .yes you are doing your job ok , getting your salary and everything is going quite well .but there is always ( or at least there have to be ) new thoughts in your mind .you have to bring them to life or at least give them a chance .after this period you have to risk your life , because miracles only come into life by taking risks .in today s world mostly people who is taking risks becomes succesful .you have to try something that nobody has seen and tried , unless you would be an ordinary working man like most of the others .yes it is possible to lose lots of things and fail by taking risks , but people mostly learn from their failures , not from their successions .so with every failure you give it another chance and after a while you get so many experiences by this behaviour .and yes in life every experience leads to the world of succession .at the end i could say that yes its too risky to change your style and start something new , and yes you can even fail and lose lots of things , but what else can give you the feeling of being proud of yourself when you do something new that only a few people can do .be proud of yourself . ..
