in my opinion , for students , understanding concepts is more important than merely learn facts .thanks to my personal experience , there several reasons which can support this statement .first of all , if students manage to understand concepts , then they can study them in depth maybe discussing with the professor or with other classmates .they can decide if they disagree or disagree while , learning facts , does not allow student to dicuss about them .from discussions , new ideas can develop , giving to students the impression of contributing to the general knowledge grouth .secondly , trying to understand a concept is much more challenging than learning facts .of course , this is a more difficult way of learning , but i am convinced that in the end it gives better results because if students want to understand concepts they have to think about them .while reasoning and discussing about a concept , students start naturally to memorize it without learning the lecture by heart .finally , studying thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts is not only useful , but also less boring .for example i would find really boring to learn a sequence of dates and historical events , while i would find much more interesting to try to link them logically , finding cause effect bounds .in conclusion , i understand that sometimes , especially for literary subjects , learning facts is necessary , but i strongly believe that this way of learning has to be accompanied by a deep understanding of the facts and of the links betweeen them .this is not only a good way of memorizing witout too mucch effort , but also a way of making the learning more engrossing .
