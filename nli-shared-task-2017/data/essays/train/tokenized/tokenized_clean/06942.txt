cars using with in the 20 yearsin twenty years there will be less cars in use than there are today .i strongly agree with this statement .in twenty yearss people must be responsible about their environment and they can reduce to use bad things .nowadays , thechnology development very fast , no one think about , twenty years ago , to use an internet and to reach milions of knowledge less than one minute , and i can believe that in twenty years we use different veichles differ from the cars .we have to because we have lots of reasons to do it .first of all , oil stock is almost finishing and the scientist seek out the alternative energy supplies .so , not maybe in twenty years but it occurs very soon , we can use different transportation .it is very nice to use different things .secondly , people knows that this type of transportation cause a pollution .not only damage the environment but also the people influence it .therefore peole get sick very easily .if we don not give back bad environment to the children , we have to solve this problem .moreover , cars also cause a traffic problems everyday .when you are live in a big city , in the morning it is too difficult to go to work .sometimes when the traffic too heavy , it takse two hours to go work .in addition , scientists are working a different types of transportation , forexample they can use solar energy and they try to make a different veichles .maybe in twenty years people start to use this type of veichles .why not ?it can be excitement .in conclusion , in twenty years people use fewer cars than today .because of lots of reasons as i mention it .important part is if we want to live a wonderfull life , we have to reduce to using of cars .and try to use to safety and envorimental friendly t
