i totally agree with the opinion that successful people tend to take risks .in deed , doing just ordinary thing is stable .at the same time , however , it s not inspire the next .i suppose that if people do nt take any risks , they feel bored and have limits to more success .my grand father could success his job .he did a lot of things in his job .at first , he started chinese restaurant .as soon as this is success , he started opening another restaurant which is forcused on beer .in my grand father s era , beer is not as popular as now .he rialized this situation .then he opend his another restaurant called `` beer garden  .actually he was not first person who started beer garden , but his second restaurant was more success than first chinese restaurant .i think he could success for the following reasons .he did not feel risky at all , when he established his new business .whereas it seems that he was glad to start new thing .it is important that doing new thing is glad to .
