i have mixed feelings about the statement `` mostly advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .not all ads are same .they may be made to lure the people for purchasing the product but may be educative and of help too .advertisements are always made fansy and appealling for pulling attention of the general public making them aware about the presence of particular product in d market .but at times when the products are not advertised it never reaches the customer even though they are there in the market .i can suggest the above view by the following eg :my mother always used to complin this creepy sensation in her legs which would keep her from sleeping at night , we did everything even went to the doctor but he also could not help her much , till the time i saw this advertisement on the tv for restless leg syndrome and a specific medicine for curing it .i went back to see the doctor , spoke about it , got that medicine prescribed to mother and now she has much better relief .so in short i can say that an advertisement educated me and helped my mother .they can be deciving too like if it says for eg that a particular will remove all ur scars or marks it may not be completely true though it may help to some degree .in the end i would like to conclude by saying that advertisements are basically made to market a product but it totally depends on the the wish of the consumer whether to buy one or not .so be an intelligent buyer and make smart choices , never buy anything by just seeing the ad but buy only when u have reseached about it and are convinced to go for it .
