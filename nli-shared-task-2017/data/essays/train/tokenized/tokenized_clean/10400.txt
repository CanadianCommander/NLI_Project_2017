i do agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  .i have several reasons to support my argument but it is not easy to make an accurate decision because enjoying life means different person by person .firstly , young people usually have more free time than older people do .because of the fact that older people have a job and have a family to support , younger people tend to have more free time .for example , young people are usually refered as children , students and adult who is not married yet .they have planty of time to do exciting activities and enjoy their lifes with their friends .however , older people need to go to work and feed the family .they do not have time to do exciting activities because their tired body need a rest during holidays and weekends .secondly , young people have healthier body than older people .younger people are more eligible to do various activities than older people .such as sports that needs a lot of physical ability like rock climbing and weight lifting .although if older people are experienced in those activities , they can do it but it is not that common .when young people can start any kind of activities , old people need to measure their ability otherwise they might get injured .on the other hand , older people can also enjoy their life more than young people .if they are financially free after the retirement , they will enjoy life more than young people do .such as crusing around the world , travel to the unknown countries and living in a beautiful place .this is something that young people can not do because they need to work .however , i believe that both young and old people can achieve joyfuol life .
