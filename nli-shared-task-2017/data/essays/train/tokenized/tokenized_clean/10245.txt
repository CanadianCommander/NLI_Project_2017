advertisments have been knowen for a long time .some historians say it began during the roman empaier time .it have been used since then in different regons and cultures .however , it is used today for different porposes in different places .the advertisments could be on tv , radio , or prented forms .mostly it is posted by companies or businuss people to sell thair items or serveses .as a result , all advertisments will make the product or serves appear in the best form or stuation .in my openion , almost all advertisments make products much better then they are in reality .these days , companies and busnesses compest with each other to sell thair product to more costomers .they use the advertisments as an essentual way to reveal the product for the costomer and try to convence him about thair product .they try so hard to show the best feeatures of the product or the serves that thay have .alternatively , thay know the nagative parts of thair product or serves , but they never say these parts unless the low ask clearly to do so .for instence , there are advertisments about fitness equepments on tv that apears all day almost on every channel .these ads talks about the product as if it will help you with all your fitness needs .in the ad they mention the easyness of using the equepment and how light it is .furthermore , thay say it dose not requaer frome you a hard work and it will save your time .all of thease clames are not true at all .its clear in this ad that thay ara trying to say some thing thet the costomer wants to hear .so that he or she will by it based on what they think about the product not about waht the product provide .in canclution , ads these day is not what it should to be .it sould talk about the true good things in the product and the bad things so people can determen wather to bey it or not .
