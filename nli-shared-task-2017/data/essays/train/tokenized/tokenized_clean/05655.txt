i disagree with the statement that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .if i ran a business , i would not take risks because i think it is not worth losing money .the possible loss would probably do bigger harm than a gain of money would do good .in these days it seems to be crucial to know which risks to take and which not .yet it is my belief that sticking with a good technique , maybe one inherited by a family member that hat run the company for a long time , can be more efficient than blindly putting everything at risk .always changing strategies to the newest model will not work as efficientlz as will a good plan that is realized over a long period of time without interruption .of course , this way of managing will not make a company rich quickly .but in my opinion , it is better to start slowly and work thoroughly , than risking not only money and time , but also jobs and finally the most important of all , the company itself .an other example is education .i could have gone to school less years , compared to the rest of the family .i would have tried something new .but with this new and very risky move i could neither count on the support of my peers , nor would i have an idea about what to do .i would be helpless .chances are , that probably other people could succeed in such a situation , but i am absolutely positive that for me , the `` safe way  is the better opportunity .all together i find it more logical and mature to stick to known procedures that do work in everyday life .if somebody risks something , he or she can gain a lot on the one hand , but on the other hand , it is also possible to lose a lot .and losing a lot can not be called successful .
