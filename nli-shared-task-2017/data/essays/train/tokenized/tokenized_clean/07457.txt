i agree with this statement .some advertisements are thinking that to sell their products is the most important this is why they say any different things about the products even on the t.v and newspaper .somethimes this things make people angry so much .but this thing also couse bad for themselfs .last time my mom was watching t.v. then , a advertisements were talking about some stuff for study .he said that if you use this stuff , you can be so smart and remember so many things spanding just a week .he was so serious on the t.v and these stuff looked like really good for us .then , my mom ordered the stuff for us .few days later , we got it and tried to use it but it was not like on the t.v. actually it was completely different .so my mom called the company .finally we could get buck money but we were looking forward to useing the stuff .they made us so mud .in the same case , some people may state this thing to court .if they so , the company is going to lose .i heard that the guy , he bought really expensive car on the t.v .because he did not have enough money to buy this car .on the t.v is usually selling more cheeper .but is was fake .so he impeached to court and fought against the company .finally he won and got money from them .but even they know it , they continue to sell their products like that .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for selling their goods .but it make consumers so mud and sometimes confused .they need to think more carefully about consumers as a some people .just selling goods is so bud for people s relationship .i think when people s relationship is destroyed , the companys is also destroyed by themselfs .
