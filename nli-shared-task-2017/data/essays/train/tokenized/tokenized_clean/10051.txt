most advertise make products seem much better than they really arenow there more and more advertisements , we can see them erervy where .every advertisements is interduce the new products of their company .most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i saw a advetisement talked about a mp3 player , the advertisements said that the mp3 player can continue play mp3 for 20 hours , but most people bought it and found it can only play for 16 hours or less , so they asked the company to give a explain on it .the company s explain is that when it playing songs , it have to turn to the lowest voice and can not change songs , so it can play for 20 hours .but it is impossible for user to do like that , when turn to the lowest voice , it almost can not hear it .and change songs is very common for mp3 player .i had saw a lot so advertisement like this .so the products not that good like the advertisements told us .the advertisements  purpose is let us to buy the product , so the advertisements tell us all the good things about the product , but will not tell us what the produt is not good at .so afer we see the advertisements and buy the products , the feeling is the product is not as good as the advertisement say .so i agree with the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .most of the products can not do the advertisement said .when we buy some product we should not just only watch the advertisement , we should ask someone who buy the product is it ture like the advertisement say .do this will help alot when we buying products .
