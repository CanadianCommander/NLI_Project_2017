yes i do agree with this statement .in my point of view when a person invents something new which is not available in the market .he tries to include everything that he could do .this is a good thing .but when the time comes for advertising this product .the person tries to advertise it in such a way that he could get profits as fast as he can .lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones .when a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give .like to give a mobile phone headset , a car charger , a mobile phone carry case , some applications , games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones .when a customer look at this kind of an advertisment he gets really excited .he goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw it in the advertisment .then the shop keeper shows him , he does not like the item .why ?because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones .but they find them that they are not original .this makes a lot of problem when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else .i would like to share an example that i experienced before a year or two .there is a trademark who is really popular among the ladies .it sells readymade clothes for women .and his logo is also very popular .a shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost the half price of the material the orignal shop is selling and he advertised it in variuos magizenes and newspapers .people started buying from him not also keeping in mind that it s the same kind of material .so this kind of advertisment can loose alot of money on just silly things .in my opinion people should not do these kinds of things at all .
