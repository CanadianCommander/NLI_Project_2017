in today s developping and competitive world , not only the introduction of a new product to the market is important , but also the way used to attract people s attention to that product is essential .the business which includes this process of making a product seem attractive to the public is called the advertisement industry .although it may contribute a lot to the sales of the products , i strongly agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two main reasons why i support this idea .first of all , the aim of an advertisement is to increase the amount of product sold .so , most of the time the advertisors tend to exaggerate the benefits of the product .as better the product is presented , the more people will buy it .as a result , the advertisors misinform the public and present the product as a super product which actually is not .secondly , based on my personal experiences i think that most products turn out to have harmful effects that are never mentioned in the advertisements .the problem is the advertisors tend to mention only the positive aspects of a product and they ignore the negavite effects of it .when the customer uses the product , he or she comes across the negative effects of it as well .so the value of the product immediately decreases for the customer .for example , a few months ago a washing powder claimed to be perfect for washing machines turned out to cause severe damages on the machines .now , the advertisement of the washing powder is no longer seen on television and the sales have decreased considerably .in conclusion , advertisements are needed for giving us information about new products .however , the fact that they most of the time do not reflect the actual quality of a product decreases the reliability of the advertisements .so we should keep in mind that no product is as super as it is presented in the advertisements and that they may always have negative effects which are never mentioned in advertisements .
