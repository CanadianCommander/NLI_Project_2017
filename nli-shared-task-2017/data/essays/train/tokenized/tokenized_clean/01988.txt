as is known to everyone , there are lots of advertisements has been created druing this medium period .some people think advertisements make products seem as the same as they really are .on the other hands , some people do nt think so .in my point of view , i agree the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .the reasons why i agree are as follows .first of all , advertisements become more creative and interesting , owing to attract more buyers to buy their products .if the advertisements are really boring , there is no one will be persued to buy their products .what s more , there are lots of products in the world .some sellers suffer more pressure about how to get a important role in this market , as a conquence , the advertisements will show more information about such good products they sell .even though , the products are really not as good as advertisements present .worst of all , it s a negative cycle .lots of advertisements follow this kind of trend to gain more profits from consumers .by way of conclusion , i totally agree this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in order to attract more buyers and then earm more money , the advertisements make products which become more amazing and creative , but not they really are .it is a really negative cycle in our society .however , many people do nt pay much attention about this issue .what a pity it is .
