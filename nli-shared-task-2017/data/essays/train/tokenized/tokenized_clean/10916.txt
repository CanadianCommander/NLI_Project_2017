young mindes and the energy associated with them are the nations greatest resources .a `` youth  has the power to change the complete outlook of the society over any topic .i believe that youth can turn governments , ideas , style of leaving and any thing that one can imagine about .but , the sadest part of todays complex society comes when we realize that youths of today are much more involved in there own lives , struggling with there own problems and therby restricting there potential towards changing the society for the betterment of it .there are several resons for these changing behaviour as listed below .firstly , in todays complex life , where the life has gone so busy ; it is becoming hard to find time with your our own family s , how can one think about changing society outlook and helping the society for its benefit .mostly youths are into some form of educatiuonal institute and as the competition and technology improves more and more material gets added to their syllabus and in turn landing them with lesser and lesser time for other activities .secondly , most of the nations today are ruled by corrupted officers and governing bobies .most of the young population at that age seems to be seeking to learn more about like and its principals ; but when they realise this ugly corrupt reality of today s society they often tend to ignore it and show disinterest in it .this not only leads to the deterioration of youths courage and moral but also prevents society from any improvemnt over the current corrupt situation .thirdly , sometimes it is found that in many educational systems the youth is never encouraged and exposed to the real society around him .he/she is mostly in his own world thinking about his local problems and never developing broader outlook towards like .this prevents society from the benefits they can achieve out of youths .so , all in all i agree with the statement that today `` youths  do not give enough time to help the communities .the major reasons for these behaviour can be identified as much complex and busy life , disinterest in the current corrupt society and lack of encouragment to do community welfare services .
