today , the information is very easy to get , and every company need the people who have many knowledges of different fields .so , i think if students can learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects .then , their thinking will become more extensive , and they can get a high-paid job .finally , they will have good development of their future .nowaday , internet is very common .therefore , every country is conneted with each other .it means everyone will compete to the other people more serious .for examle , ten years ago , the students in taiwan just needed to compete with the taiwan people .now they need to compete with china students or american students .therefore , students need to have extensive knowledge and it will help them to create new thought .next , if we have many professional skills , like computer managing or finanical skill .it can help us to get a high-paid job .because if the companies hires this kind of people , it seems that they have different fields people .so if we can be this person , we will get a high-paid job , and the companies also can save money to hire many people .but how to let us have broad knowledge ?the only way which i think we should learn different academic subjects in the school .if we just focus on one specific subject , we will lose chance .some people think if we do not focus on a specific subject , we will not learn very well .we will not be professional in our field .in my opinion , i think it is wrong .if we just learn one field , it may be easy for us .but in future , we will be sad because we can not comete with the other people , therefore , i agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specizlize in one specific subject .
