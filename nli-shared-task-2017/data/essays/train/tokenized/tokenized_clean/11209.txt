succesfull people always are researching for new things and taking risks rather than counting only on what is dominated by them .the first reason that supports this statement is the fact that `` family business  are condenmed to disappear .if the family members do nt do something to capt new markets , or to introduce new techniques that make their business more effective ( reducing costs , and avoiding the competence take the leadership ) the family business will end .one example of this are the families that have been involved in a traditional bakery company .new oven techniques make the bread less expensive to produce .new bread flavours make the business more attractive for old and new customers .the second reason are what i call `` the living experiences  .i can mention several names on this essay , but i will mention just only two : bill gates will not have the company he has at this moment if his motivation to explore new markets and new technoligies was nt big enough to take some risks .he took a big risk developing `` windows  instead keeping the old way to run programs .the dos was leading the operative systems market during that time , but bill gates thought further and explored a new way to show infromation , windows was born .donald trump would not became multi millionary if his quest for new business research , and the evident tendency of taking risks was nt part of his attitude .his diversity goes from casinos in nevada , to golf resorts in california .there is a spanish saying `` do nt put all the eggs in the same pot  ; this saying matchs perfectly in to trump s business vision and the need of looking for new horizons .for these reasons succesfull people is always trying new things and taking risks instead only doing what they they already know how to do well .
