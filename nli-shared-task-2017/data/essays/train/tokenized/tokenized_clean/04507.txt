it might be confusing at first , or might be obvious that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  , but i disagree on this matter .it can not be contradicted that youth is full of exitment , experiencing new things and having a somewhat careless approach towards life because of the lack of responsibilities , but in my view , it is once someone has gone through all of this that they can finally enjoy life .one of the most important matters proving this point is all of the disapointments experienced during youth .at a young age , we all are convinced that everything is for the best .we have unrealistic dreams , and exceedingly high expectations from everyone who surrounds us .we live in this euphoria , in a perfect world very much like the peaceful garden of eden .then , everyone goes through the unevitable course of life where we are disapointed , fooled and put back on earth .it does sound terrible but it is only a natural stage in life .we realize that our parents and siblings are not perfect , that our friends are not perfect .we experience our first harsh heartbreak .during adolescences we often live through an akward phase of discomfort with our own selves and do not seem to accept the person we are .all of these stages are building blocks to make us into the person we end up being and accepting to be as an adult .the path we need to go through to find who we are is one of the reasons why i do nt believe that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do .once we do arrive to the point of adulthood , which i have not personally reached but have observed through my parents and other adults around me , we finally accept who we are .we look back on events or poeple that suprised us , that disapointed us or that satisfied us in the past and realise that often those helped us become who we are or in some cases are so insignificant .being an adult , once a person defines who they are and know who they are in their society , it is only then that they can really enjoy life .when we have been disapointed and have discovered everyone s true colors is when we are finally comfortable , and unless we feel comfortable we can not enjoy life and do everything we really want to do .every stage in life is a beautiful one , although it is sometimes hard , but to me adulthood is really the stage we enjoy .
