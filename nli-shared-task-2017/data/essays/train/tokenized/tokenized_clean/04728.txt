i agree with this statement which says `` must advertisement make products seem better than really are .for example when i are go to a sopermarct store i usully look at a known brids .it seem better but when i start to use it i reallize that the old one is much better .here in the usa every day you can see a new advertisement .like `` gigou  the enshorance company .i have an experince with this company in my last accident .i told them i want to get cash instade of fixing me my car but they rifuse .than after tow monthes the took about same stution in thier ad .i did nt keep my mouth shout .when i have return they told me no we ca nt give the money to you .frome that time i hated to see ads in tv .second reasone i thik it s the ads job to make products seem better so the consumer change his idea and use this product .after that they made more and more money .that explan why i gree with that statment .
