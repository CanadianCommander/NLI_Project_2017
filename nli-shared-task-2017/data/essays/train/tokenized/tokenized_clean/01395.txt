when you have a mastercard in the dessert will it be usefull for you while you want water to survive ?this is the way who ideas and concepts work .in real live you will act naturally as you are and as you know without refeering to the math or the physics .you will drink water without thinking that it is compind of hydrogen and oxygen .so , learnning the facts is more imprtant than understanding the concepts because in real life you will use the facts easier , and you can do it naturally without wasting time in thinking while there is no time .first of all , in our life when we face something we cope with it easier with facts which includes an expieriance from father or brother or even from tv .however , when you want to do something you will not bring your calculator and your pincel and think about it .for example , when you sit with your grandmother you know it just want someone to sit with her and hear she talking about boring thing , but as you do nt show that you are not bored as your grandmother will love you more .second , we act as a human , and this does nt mean that we don d use our hids .when you had a puncture you will rise your foots and try to control the car .you did nt know that from safety program , but you learn it by using human sense , and this is the most important thing that we have , so we should use it .finally , our backgrounds about something and our natural behaviore are very usefull things .on the other hand , we should not think that the concepts are nt important , but they are not important as the facts are , and as i have said you will not bring your notebook and your calculator to solve everything , and sometime you do nt have the time to think as while you have a puncture .
