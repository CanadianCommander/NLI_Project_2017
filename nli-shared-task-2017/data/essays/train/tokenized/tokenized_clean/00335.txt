i agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .now adays advertising and media is every thing to consumers .companys pay millions in ads .every year to survive in the market and competition .it all goes back to the consumer , not every thing u see in the advertisements could exactly be the same as u see .or example the soup u see boilng in the tv looks always as if it tastes good , but u might try it once and it might not suit u.this why i say it all goes back to the consumer .another example is a laptop which looks very nice in a newspaper advertisement , but once seeing it with ur eyes it looks smaller than the picture and not the right quality .there are lot of types of advertisements .one type is acompany whose looking for long term bussiness not willing to get out of the market easily , so they try to keep there advertisement the closest to reality as much as possible .another type is a company that wants to sell the product a couple of times and build the company on the support they will offer with the product , and these companies need to have nice advertising a little bit , than reality so the consumer can buy from the first pass .they companies are mainly found in the market and they are meduim run companies .another type of company is a company who wants to sell its product for 1 time and leave with the profits , so this type of company has to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only .finally what i can say is people now a days are more and more educated than old days , so most of the advertising should match up peoples thinking and they should be the closest to reality and the best looking to consumers .
