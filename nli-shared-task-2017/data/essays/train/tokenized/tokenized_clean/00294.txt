in a contemporary society , someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent , and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics .the current techniques are getting more complicated and the competition is getting more intense as the time goes on .therefore , it is more likely recomendable to devote a specific field of study or work and to be highly qualified on it .first , the current field of researches , such as computer science and electronic technology , which dominate the development of a current society , need very deft and highly qualified skills and knowledges .these fields of products changes actually every minute .cellphone which produced early this year is already outmoded and 2 year-old laptop is not producing anymore .moreover , it is getting common to access internet with phones and laptops everywhere , and can do whatever i want , like watching tv , movies , or chatting on line with my friends .therefore , intensive and specialized skills and knowlege on electronic and mobile technology are desperately needed these days .secondly , artists are getting more praised and encouraged because art amuse people and help them have a stable metal health .thus , highin conclusion , being a specialist on a certain field is more remarkable and worthable to improve our society .general information can be accessed by everyone who can watch tv or can use internet .if i want to survive from the harsh competition of the current society , i need to devote to a certain field of research or business , and be a specialist who has unique information or skill .
