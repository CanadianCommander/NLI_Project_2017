in my university , most of the students tend to complete their studies in the field that they started , and they direct their minds into one specific subject without going out of it .for students this easy path always give many advantages on their own fields .however , without any interaction with other subjects academic life might be too mediocre .students who satisfy all the offered courses in one subject have a good chance to enhance in that subject , and they can easily follow what is required for them because the curriculum is already determined for them .for example , during the whole of his/her undergraduate study , a student who studies in department of mathematic must register for a certain number of credits or courses which are all related to mathematics .such a person whose mind is full of mathematical problems might be a very reputed academician or scientist in the future , but he/she loses the chance of learning different subjects and relating and developing them .on the other hand , one who tries to get a broad knowledge of various academic fields can use those subjects with each other .in other words , one specific subject can help to develop another .for instance , although i studied philosophy at the university , in the second year of my study i chose to register for a minor program on architectrue .this gave me o good chance to interprete architectural productions in a philosophical way .i gained a chance to investigate architectural effects on human .in conclusion , even though specializtion on a single subject might be useful within that subject , for me it is more enjoyable and interesting to specialize in avariety of subjects .this provides me to create my own style in the academy .
