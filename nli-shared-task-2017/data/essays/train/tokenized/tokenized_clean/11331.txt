i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i believe that the reason behind this statement are the parents .the child will grow up depending on how the parents raise them .it is the parents responsibility to give their children the knowledge of the community they live in and what they have to do in order to fit in their community .i strongly believe that the young people nowadays are very spoilt .they are not taught the value of money .families give them enormous amounts of money and the freedom to spent it as they want .as every young person they think that everything in life is money .because of this , young people have no morals left .they grow up learning how to spend money .parents do not give as much time as before to their children .even the celebration of the holidays are not the same anymore .young ones care about their morals much less than the older generation .for example , i live in istanbul , and according to our religious holidays the whole family , from youngest to the oldest , comes together .if not the young ones go to visit their elders .but , nowadays unfortunately this is not happening .younger generations do not care about these things .they prefer being with their friends .life to them is about drinking , driving the most expensive car , going out with the pretiest girl or wearing only brand names .as a conclusion , i blame the parents for this situation .every parent is responsible for their own child and it is up to the parents how they brought up their child in to this community .young people either will be welcomed by their community or be rejected .
