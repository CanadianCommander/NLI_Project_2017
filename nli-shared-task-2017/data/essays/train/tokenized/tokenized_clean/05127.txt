it is important to know a lot about economics and social sciences to predict in an appropriate way if the amount of used cars will decrease in the next twenty years .is there any lack or shortage of cars in our society ?it seems that every family and also every lonely living person has at least one car .additional cars are not required for the private use .because the population in my native country ( germany ) is not growing any more , it is likely to agree to the statement so far that the number of used cars will probably not increase .it could stay constant .other questions concern the alternatives of driving a car .travelling by train is still very expensive in germany - the high prizes for petrol are not worse .our train system still has to solve many problems ( too many trains are critically late , sometimes they are overboarded ) so that the possibility to use a train instead of a car ist not very attractive to many persons .one completely different aspect is the availability of petrol in the future and how fast an adequate substitute can be found and introduced .maybe in twenty years , it could be the privelege of a few very rich people to drive a car , because the little accessible rest of petrol will have .how much cars are needed for the industry ?and what is the tendancy how the indostrial need for cars will develope during the next twenty years ?here i have to display my lack of knowledge .many articles , chemical components and other things have to be transported from one place to the other .the disire that the economy of a nation should grow for it s own ` heath  does nt suggest that cars could be less needed for oconomic purposes in twenty years .as a summary , it is visible that there are many different tendancys and developments which make it almost impossible to predict the amount of used cars in the year 2026 .
