i think it is a very positiv point of view and i complitly support it .only lazy poeple sit on what they have , and look where they are at . ..i think that you do not lose any thing except a little bit of money by trying new things .what i mean is that you actualy have a lot of chances to fail but if you success you can make a lot of money and that is how poeple see you .i would have to take for example for this point mr. bill gate who has tryed to revolutionate computers and as result he is the wealthyest person on the planet .i could also take my mother as an example , everytime she tries a new recepy , it is not always good but this way she gets better .because i can tell her what went wrong or what should she add .could you imagin a world where no one would neither invent nor change anything ?that world would be the lazy s world .i would get bored after one second .one day someone told me :  it is by making mistakes that you will get better  and until now nothing has proved him wrong !he also sed :  you can never fail , the only thing you can do wrong is not to try !i  actualy glad i met that person because since then , i have just been going forward in life and in sports .after that i think it is also a way of life and i think some poeple or born with desire and some are not .i have rarelly seen poeple learn that kind of things .i am going to have to take my brother as example : my parents and i think he is talented in a lot of things but he just does not expend his knowledge .
