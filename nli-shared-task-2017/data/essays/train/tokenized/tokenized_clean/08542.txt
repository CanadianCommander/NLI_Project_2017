i agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years later than today .there are several cconditions to make this phenomenon possible .first , the fuels for cars will be almost depleted in the future .this condition will render to decrease the amounts of usage of the cars .the usage of car will be distinct , when the energy source of the cars are all used up .it will continue until the other energies are discovered .second , there will be other transportations which can replace the cars .there will be a huge change in technology and science , thus other transportation can be developed .for example , the airplane can be produced in small size , small as cars , with large amounts , and by low cost .thus , it can be used as cars we uses in the present .last , the tranportations will not be needed at all .as i stated on the last paragraph , there will be a huge developement .a machine that can send people or materials from one place to another place can be invented .if this kind of machine is invented , it will be worthless to use any transportation .in sum , there will be fewer usage of the cars in twenty years later than that of the present .it will be fewer due to the lack of the source of energy , or the developement of other transportations , or the invention of the machine that can convey people and materials .
