in my family there are lots of people both young and old .being a young person or being an old person has its own enjoys .however , i am just 22 years old and i think i agree with this topic .firstly there are some enjoys of being an old person .being an old person may be gives a fresh feeling .beause of the fact that ; older people in my family have worked all through their life .as a result they know the importance of the time .therefore , when they find a chance to travel , they use this chance .in addition to this they are much more experienced from young people and use teir experiences while enjoying .there may be some enjoys being an old person ; however there are also some distinct disadvantages .first of all older people are occasionly reluctant about spending time to enjoy .they generally prefer to rest that stem from their older ages .in contrast to younger people are rearlly reluctant about spending time to enjoy .for example , if a friend of mine call me and propose to go to a bar , at that time i accept him proposal .another example ; last summer i went five distinct vacation places for my holiday .i had enough energy to travel lots of places .but i think if i were older , i would not go to five different places for holiday .probably i went a seaside and stayed there allthrough the holiday .in addition to these older people always wish to be more younger .it means that the younger you are the more enjoy you doi think you can easily make out from the explanations i give above why i think younger people enjoy life more than older people do .being a older person has its own enjoys but , i prefer enjoying as a younger person
