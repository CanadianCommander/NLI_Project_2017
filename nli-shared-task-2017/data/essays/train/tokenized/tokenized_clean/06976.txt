i rather agree and disagree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  .well it depends on the people on how they take the situation .young people who are more enthusiastic towards forming a community can tend to help more .and they would rather give enough time to dedicate on helping their communities .on the other side , some of the people show less concern towards helping their communities .perhaps they would be rather busy with their day-to-day activities .they would be more selfcentered and they would never even bother about helping their communities .it is not necessary for the younger people to dedicate much of the time helping their communities , infact a little amount of can help much better .sideways poeple with positive views towards developing a community are more concerned to help their communties and dedicate their sufficient work to help them get the communities better .they will organise more effective programs to help their communities .they will arrange more and more effective plans to take their communities in a straight way .the young people should be motivated about helping their communities and effective programs are to be implemented to motivate people .moreover some or more young people are more than enough for a community to develope .however formation of the communities helps most of the things to grow in a straight way .it will also give suggestions to most of the problems .communities should be developed in such a way that they should drive the people s attention towards them .they can do this by organsing some cultultural activities in some occassions .by doing so , most of the young people will be motivated to help their communities .so by all of the above points , not all young people are not concerned about helping their commodities .it depends on the people on how they are .and the activities taken by the communities which drive the attention of young people .
