i do agree with statement i.e successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .iam of the opinion that because of there are several reasons and example , to support my opinion .man is a gregarious person and greedy person man has no satis faction with his already achievements .he is raedy to take risks and pains to invent new things .for example in early stages scientists are invented bycycle , and then invented automobiles , planes etc .there is no end for invention , because technology has developed day by day .great people are always thinking and thinking they are always look for some progress .compared to olden days now technologyhad developed more .great people are think there is no end for success , it is going on going on there is no end .if there is end no meaning , because great people are searching for better to best now days population are increasing like temperature increases , if there is no place for humanbeings on land people can live on moon also .so i strongly support the statement , people want changes in life it will be help ful to better living .if great people are also thinking like this .they have no rest , if they are taken rest there is no further improvement in our lives .
