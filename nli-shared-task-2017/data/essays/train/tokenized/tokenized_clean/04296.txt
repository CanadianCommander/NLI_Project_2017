it is possible to use fewer cars than we use today ?can we stop ussing the car ?there are two different answers for these questions , yes or no .in one hand we can say that in twenty years we will use less the car because it will come a day in which every road , every city and every country will be colapsed because of the cars .it will be so full of cars that i am sure that the air will be black because of the polution .there are more causes that we can say that argue this idea , cars consume a lot of petrol and petrol is not eternal , so they we have to invent new car models without the necesity of using petrol .i am sure that they will invent them but not in twenty years now .in the other hand we have that we will use more cars than the ones we use now , could this be possible ?yes .nowadays the media is to have more than one car for each person , something really hard to believe , because , how wants more than one car ?i do not know but it is the truth .if we still buying more than one car , or if we buy only one car for each person , definately , in twenty years we will use more cars than we do today .i have to say that i fell like fear if i start to think this because we could not go anywhere anyway , i mean , there will be so many cars that we could not go by car because it will bw colapsed , and we could not go walking because it will be poluted , so what can we do ?the main problem is that we have not got any solution .we can not oblige anybody not to go by car and go walking , but we can try to use the car as less as possible , for example , going four only in one car instead of going in four cars or something like that .to conclude , i have to said that we have to find solutions to this problem if we want to live in a place with pure air and without a lot of noise and accidents , using less the car will cause less accidents .
