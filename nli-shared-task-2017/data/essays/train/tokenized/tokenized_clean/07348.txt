understanding ideas and concepts suggests understanding a way of thinking or understanding how ideas are connected and concepts can develop .to me , that is more important than learning facts alone for the simple reason that you can apply a way of thinking to many different situations .learning facts only is limiting one s knowledge to a specific area or subject and does not even imply that one understands how these facts are connected .however , i still do believe that a balance between both is necessary and depending on what a student s intended job is , one skill might become more important than the other .let s consider a historian for example .can a historian specialized in roman history and who does not know the facts of the rise and fall of the roman empire for example still be considered a historian ?probably not .a historian might indeed need to know more facts than a marketing executive for instance but he or she will also probably be a much better historian if he or she also understands how all facts are connected .on the other hand , i believe that it is more important for a marketing executive to better understand concepts and ideas than it is to know all facts about a given undustry or product .first of all , a marketing executive does not need to be as specialized as a historian , indeed , he or she should be able to apply his or her skills to any industry .second , not knowing all facts about a specific field might actually foster creativity and new concept development by removing any `` limits  of the mind .third , a marketing executive who understands concepts and ideas might be able to see better synergies between them and apply them in innovative ways .however , as i stated above , i still maintain that some sort of a balance is needed to achieve excellency .a marketing executive would be that much stronger if he or she could draw some patterns from past facts for instance or if he or she demonstrates a more precise knowledge of the product or service and its related competition scene that he or she is working on .
