different from past , these days , because of developed science techniqe , usually students study very hard and they can learn many things .although idea and concept are efffective for students , before recongnized facts , they ca nt learn exactly about that .hence i strenthly disagree that statement .first , if we are learn or study for something , we have to know facts .because before recognize facts , we ca nt understand that and we ca nt make ideas or concepts .there are many subjects in the studay , math , english , science , music , fine art , and so on .for example , in music and fine art case we do nt have to learn many thing , however we ca nt think or make idea or concept without basic facts .especially , in science and math case we have to learn basic fact .moreover we do nt need to use science and math .there are calculate and fact .second , after graduate school , usually we attend company .so we have to learn many things in school .but if we learn method of make idea or concept and graduate school , we ca nt live without fact in society , especially company .we ca nt work with only idea and concept .money is very important at companies .but if we got idea and concept more than fact in school we ca nt alive at company .it is impossible .of course , before got facts we could think idea and concept , but if we use idea more than facts , we can homless .facts is vety important everything .these days , it is getting important .without learn fact in school we ca nt develop ourselves .so i disagree
