i agree with the idea thinking the cars will be replaced with the better tools for transportation and more friendly to environment in the near future .cars are the most common transporation tool for the present years .they are slower then flight but cheaper in cost , cheaper in cost then bicycles or whatever the vehicles manual forces should be put to operate but a lot faster and the cost is endurable for the common people comparing to flight fare .however they have been issued with envormental concerns that the cars produce harmful substances to the nature such as air etc .of course in twenty years coming , people will try to invent the non harmful fuel to feed the cars for operation however i strongly believe the smart human beings , considered to be ` magic hands  to invent whatever they need , olny the matter is the time , will get another brilient creation to satisfy the speed as plans , cost effective and also needs to be friendly to enviroment .it may have a form of car-like appearance , however if you meant the cars with speed like today and causing concerns like they do today , i may expect the new creation or invention ( will be named differently with cars ) to replace the cars today .let s try to picture the things that have same look as cars nowadays but no wheels are flying here and there for common people s daily transportation .there will be no much heavy traffic in the road as there is now .they are faster as planes and the fare is also endurable as i expect in the future , then not many people will be late for the jobs or classess being stuck in the traffic .also the concerns about pollution by cars will be relieved .some people might say twenty years are regarded to be too short for another stage of transportation system however , i reflected my little hope to have this ` mighty tool  for my daily commuting to work in the near future in this writing .
