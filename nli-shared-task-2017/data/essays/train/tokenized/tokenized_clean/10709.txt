i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are two reasons why i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .first , we always choose same product at the supermarket .for example , my friend always goes to supermarket every sunday , and he always buys a same snack .one day , i asked him about , `` why do you choose same snack  .he answered that , `` i always watched this snack s commercial at television , then i think that this snack is tastes good , so i always chose this one .i think that his favorite snack s taste is not good but he influenced by television commercial , so he always chooses same snack .second , we always belive the content of commercial .for example , two years ago , my sister bought an expensive natural food .my fater asked my sister about , `` why do you buy an expensive natural food ?my sister answered that , `` according to this book , this food is good for us , so i buy this food .however , her natural food was nt special natural food .her book said that there are a lot of value in her natural food , but it was as same as normal food .she influensed by the advertisement that included her book .recently , there are many advertisements in the television commercial , radio commercial , magazine , book , newspaper , and so on .however , advertisements do nt always show a correct information .the meaning of advertisement is to sell a lot of goods , so when we buy any good , we should reserch a lot of information , and we should ask opinion to family or friends .if we can collect a lot of information , we can choose correct good .i think that correct information is more important than influence by advertisement .before we chose good , we should remember this thing .
