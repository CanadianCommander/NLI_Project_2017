knowlegde in our modern days is underrated .in fact , people do no not appreciate the fact that education has developed in order to provide students with several subjects to accompany the throughout their journey .how is it possible for someone to turn down the chance of taking many academic subjects and just pick one ?in my opinion , i think that it is definitely better to have broad knowledge of several academic subjects that to just pick one .when students are offered the choice of picking several academic subjects , they should that oppurtunity by hand .graduating in multiple subjects certainly makes a person more intellectual in society .if someone can only speak of one subject in society then he would be considered as a poorly intellectual person .specializing in different and many academic subjects surely increases your knowledge of your surroundings and opens the doors to different horizons .it really is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects since it enlightens a person and gives him a general idea of many topics to talk about .it is considered as a step to a more developed world where people are more open to important subjects .as an example of my argument , i would like to talk about my own experience in this subject .as a kid , my parents enrolled me in a tri-lingual school that offers english , french and arabic as primary languages .during the first years of my education , i thought that that was a stupid mistake .growing up , i realized that i had lots of oppurtunities ahead .i had the ability of speaking three different languages which could definitely broaden my horizons .this is just a simple example of how specializing in many subjects can let you work your way up !!finally , a broader knowlege of many subjects takes nothing but a little hard work and effort .not only does it provide general information of many topics but it also gives an outstanding chance to have a successful life .one specified subject can never be enough in a world that provides so much for us .
