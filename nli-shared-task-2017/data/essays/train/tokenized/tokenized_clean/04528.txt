i think it is a difficult question because it can have two simliar meanigns .first if it is better for a student to know the theory rather than the practise aspect ; but it can mean also , if it is better for a student to understand a concept rather than the fact which the concept come from .in this second meaning , for example , if it better for a student to learn principal political ideas of the french revolution or to learn facts that brought to the revolution ; or to know causes and effects of the second world war or to know personal hitler history .i think that there is not a more important thing between understanding ideas and learning facts .in fact , education can not be only theoryc .so i do not agree with the statement .for example , in chemestry , student can not learn only formulas .he-she has to do experiments , otherwise science can not go on , because theories have to be proved .maybe only who studies philosophy can learn only ideas of ancient greek or roman philosophers , for instance .that means that who works only with concepts can have an abstract way of learning .even though also in this field there is a sort of evolution .for example , some branches of philosophy , of humanities , like antropology has to study human behaviour so it has to know facts .in the field i study , that is law , facts are really important .eve though there are many rules , we can not use only them to give a legal advise .we need to refer to facts that really happened .
