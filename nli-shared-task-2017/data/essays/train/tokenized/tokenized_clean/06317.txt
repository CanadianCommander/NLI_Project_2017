i think that new things in life can be discovered only if there is a perfect observation .if it wo nt be there then it s not possible to discover new things .some belive that taking risks in life you may go ahead but others think that it s better to do what we know .but i think that successful people try new things and take risks .i have several reasons for holding my opinion .if a person is working in a factory and his boss has alloted a particular work and he is confused then it will be difficult for him to do that work .but if he takes risk and try to solve that problem then it would be very easy to help his boss .even , scientists are inventing more things by taking risk .for an example , while inventing a computer it was difficult for them to select what was necessary for inventing it .but , at that time if they would not have taking risk then it would be difficult for them to invent a computer .i would like to give an example of an everyday s life .some people spend there money in buying lottery tickets by taking risks .but if they will get double money then it would be useful for them .and as such they will be beniffited by taking risk .if a person is shy or is not ready to take risk then he might miss an opportunity in getting scholarship .if he thinks taht his score is very low then he is unable to apply his result in different universities .and probaly he will have to waste his future .as a result of risk our country is progressing economically .if we would nt have taken risk then we would be still standing at that same placewere our ancesstors were .so , i think that taking risks in life successful people try new things .
