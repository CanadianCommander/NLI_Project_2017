it is quite true that the advertisement companies are all over the world today and making a great improvement by enabling the companies to increase the amount of the product they sell and consequently the profit they get .obviously , advertising have become a huge industry , which attracts the attention of all companies producing various kind of goods for different purposes and for different target consumers or clients .however , it is still questionable to what extent advertisements reflect the real quality of a certain product .by remembering the kinds of advertisements which were in display almost fifty years ago , we can easily conclude that the early examples were not that much exaggerated or confusing .they simply described the product or the service with a nice background music .later on more story-like advertisements , which aim to influence the audience emotionally , were produced because an emotional kind of attachment with a certain product or service renders it more likey to be remembered .a close look at the recent kinds of advertisements on tvs or radios reveals the fact that today s advertisements are far from reflecting the real quality of a product .many customers complain that they are not satisfied with the product or the service they receive and they believed that they are fooled by the shiny advertisements .majority of the people who watches tv at night tend to change the channel when an advertisement is shown because it is believed that it does not describe the product or the service objectively .additionally , it became quite difficult to understand the story - like advertisements because they divert our attention to the other details instead of the product itself .one can feel as if he/she is watching a fashion show while watching a car advertisement .fortunately , some rules and regulations put forward to restrict the unrealistic depictions of the products in advertisements .recently certain instutions are established enabling customers to defend their rights if they are fooled by advertisements .
