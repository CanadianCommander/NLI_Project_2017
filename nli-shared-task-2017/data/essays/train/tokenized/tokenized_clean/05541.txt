i believe that people do enjoy life more when they are young than when they age .life is a gift and needs to be enjoyed to the maximum .consider a young kid about 15-20 years of age , for him life has just begun .he is opened out to a world where there is joy and peace , sorrow and grief both at a time .for this young lad , almost everything he does is his first time at it and will be excited no matter what .on the contrary people aging lets us say about 35-50 years have already seen all that the young kid has seen and gone through .for the old lifes just passing by .younger children often are more energetic and enthusiastic and yet more vibrant in doing something mostly if it is for the first time .while for the elderly , they have too many responsibilities and burdens on their shoulders that they do not seem to enjoy .thats why they take time off from work for a vacation to relax , just to get back and start all over again .in a way even if the old want to enjoy they still are held back and are circumscribed in their ways .i believe the main reason why the young enjoy life more is that they do not have any burdens at their tender age .all they have to take care is their grades and studies .the rest all are taken care of from their parents .the old even when they retire think of their grandchildren and their education .the beauty in life as i think of it is to live each day as a gift as this is mostly found in the young .
