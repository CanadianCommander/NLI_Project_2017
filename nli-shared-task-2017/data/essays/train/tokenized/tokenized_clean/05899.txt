the important of education is emphasized and re-emphasized in our world of 21st century .as technology develops and histroy gets longer , we are exposed to more things to learn .given this fact , is it better to specialize in one specific subject or have a broad knowledge on many academic subjects ?people s opinions may vary on this controversial issue , but i believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject .generally , people go through 12 to 13 years of education in secondary schools and have another 2 to 4 years of education in college .as college students , we major in a specific subject such as interior design , psychology or hotel management .why do we major in only one or two subjects ?it is because we are unable to learn vast amount of information on varying academic subjects .people say that we learn from the past .let s look at sumer , one of the earliest civilization in mesopotamia between tigris and euphrates rivers .about 9000 years ago , the period called the `` neolithic age  began in this civilization .as nomadic people who depended on hunting and gathering for their survival settled to a permant place and started agriculture , their civilization boomed .population dramatically increased and their civilization further enhanced .it was about this time when what is called , `` the specialization of labor  began .this means that each people had a job and a role in their society .some people concentrated on farming while others made potteries and others carried out religious rituals .because no individual could make a living producing all the food , clothings and habitats oneself , the civilization practiced specialization of labor .like what our ancestors long before showed , i think each individual should specialize in one subject now a day .this will further develop our civilization and benefit us as it is more effective than everyone studying the same subjects at a limited level .let s compare our field of education to that of the universe .if an astronaut makes his way out of our galaxy who s never done in the past , he s drawn a significant line in the history of human beings and the universe .however if the same astronaut visits the moon which has been already executed by many other astronauts , he will just remain as one of the great astronauts .the same concept goes to education .if we explore all the areas of academic subjects at a limited level , there will be no development in human beings  knowledge , but just a repetition of what others have done .however if we specialize in one specific subject , our knowledge to that specific area will expand .in conclusion , because noone is able to learn all of the existing subjects at a sophisticated level , i believe it is better to specialize in a specific subject .this specialization of learning may limit some people to that area of study only , but it is much more efficient and beneficial to human beings as we can develop our knowledge and contribute our learnings to the human beings and our world .
