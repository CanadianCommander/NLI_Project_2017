i agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .in a student age it is very much essential to get a idea and concept on the subject before learning facts .for example maths is a subject where we shoud have an idea and the concept ie logical thinking of how we should do the problem .if we dont have concept of how to do addition then how can we proceed furrter .concept is like a root to devolop furter .when a student can understand about the idea and about the concept it is very much easy to learn about the fact .the student if he starts understanding the concept and idea he can never forget the things .witout a concept studying is simply muging up .when the student starts understanding about the idea and the concept of a subject it is very much easy for him to learn .at the student age only our main idea and the concept starts .if a student is learning anything without a concept is something like root without a stem .whenever we want do something we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenever a student is studying or doing any practical he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the facts .many students loose the oppurtunities because of lack of devoloping ideas , and lack of concept in the subject .i feel if we have an idea and concept on the subject it is very much easy to learn .secret of success of many students because of there conceputial way of studying .i conclude that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
