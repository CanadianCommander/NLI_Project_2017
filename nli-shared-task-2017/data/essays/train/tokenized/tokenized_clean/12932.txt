why has gandhi been so famous all around the world ?not only was he aware of the indian poverty and he could just have analysed the situation and published his work , but his fate was more , he has to claim for more equqlity on the planet stage and he took risks for that .in fact everybody is able to learn from others like teachers but only people who then follow their own ways and prove to be original , which assumes taking risk , become successful people .that is called ambition .why have those famous people wnted to do more than stay on their knowledge ?intelligence , innovation , power .first , many famous people have proved their willingness to go much deeper in the field they are interessted in .for instance einstein was a very bad student but fond of physics .thank to that passion he started sudying specific subjects related to that and discovered relativity .his theory was first denied in his obstination , he took risk and nowaday everyone is working on the basis of its work .intelligence make people focus on their interest and take risk to argue their point of view , which lead them to success .then , innovation which means risk is part of a process that make someone be famous .look at bill gates , how he has improve people s lifes with microsoft ?this is one of the ugest innovation we have ever experience .but this is the first step .in order not to be forgotten , on really should continue to innovate .otherwise , the famous peolple die suddenly .finnally , what lead people to become famous id their attraction to power .for example nicolas sarckosy , canditate for presidency in frence doesn t hide his which of power .that value encourage people to take risk .
