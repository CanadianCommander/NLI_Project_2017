in my opinion both types , the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learning of facts , are important .one reason is , that students who just learn the facts of course have a great data bank but it s just learned by heart , they do nt see any connections .to see those connections the students have to take a look at the ideas and concepts of what they learn .another reason is that students , which just learn by heart everything , are not as able to make a decision as students who see more than just the facts .for example , a history class talks about an important happening in their country s history .on the one hand they have to know the dates and why something has happened , without this it is impossible to talk about the reason and the consequences , but on the other hand it is needed that the students understand the idea which leaded to this happening .only with this both kinds of study combined it is possible to have a productive discussion and a succesful education .finally i disagree with the statement , because i think that it s not possible to choose between one of the kinds of studying .the students need both to get the best out of their education and so it s important to use both types for studying .
