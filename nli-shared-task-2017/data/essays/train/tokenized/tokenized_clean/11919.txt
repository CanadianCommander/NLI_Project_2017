enjoyment of life is boon from god to all the living creatures .every person likes to enjoy his life in his own way , irrespective of his age .age is not the matter to enjoy life , since every person enjoys his life according to the energy he is capable of .according to my point of view young people enjoy a lot than older people , because they are cold blooded , highly energitic and flexible to every movement .since it is a growing age , he is free of problems , and enjoys every movement of life .due to the flexibility he can do any thing he wanted to do , without any riddles .young people enjoy life by participating in various activities as a part of studying .for example young people belonging to school age enjoy a lot , such as making noises , screaming , fighting among themselves , parcipating in various physical activities , due to which they maintain agood health which yeilds good growth .because this is the age we able to know each other , knowing relationships making buddies and having lots of fun .older people are not so energitic as young blood , because of the age factor , not flexible body as age grows and responsibilities they have around them .they can not enjoy the same one as , the zeal with which young people do .because they are always cornered with the problems and responsibilities that surround around them .according to me young people are free birds who can stretch their wings to enjoy the world around them .at the mourning age we like to spend a lots of time with friends , roaming on bikes and attending parties and functions to get the time passed and the joyful and delightful mood .at this age we spend lavishly and even and we do not even known how to control our activities .older people can not do the same as young lads do since they know life and the consequences they limit themselves to major extend .every person has his own view .according to me we enjoy a lot in youn
