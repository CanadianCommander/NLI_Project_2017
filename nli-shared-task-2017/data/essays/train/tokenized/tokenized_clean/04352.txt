when was the last time you spend just an hour helping another person ?all of us -- not only young peopole -- may think about this question , because nowadays we ve became more selfish , completely dedicated to our own lifes and sometimes we do nt realize that there s a lot of people around us that are less priviledged and need help .therefore , it s true that now we do nt give enough time to helping our communities .i think that there are several factors that explain this behaviour .firstable , society does nt recognized this contribution , but instead of it , you re better if you get two majors , an excellent job , buy a car and a house and live with all the conveniences .so , we spend our time trying to get these goals and forgetting about the community .a second factor could be that nowadays the time is the most appreciated value .the companies pay us for our time , we spend a lot of time working , and free-time is very important for us .working on a ong project will take us a lot of free and not revenued time , so we prefer not to do it .to illustrate this point i can talk about my own experience .while i was working for an advertising agency i tried to spend more time helping the others , i felt that i had to do it .i contacted to ` aldeas infantiles  ( a childhood project ) and i spent a year teaching children and playing with them just friday afternoons .in the end i decided to quit the project because i worked at the office son many hours than then i did nt have enough time to see my boyfriend and my family .i realized that time was too much important if you do nt have enough .in short , although it s difficult to have enough time for all , we have to try it and spend maybe just an hour a week helping our community .
