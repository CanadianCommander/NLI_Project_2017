people start leaning , observing and thinking at the early age .in schools , they express their opinions and exchange their ideas .some might have different opinions from others , while others tend to think in a same way .it is important to pay attention to other s opinion and understand them .you do not need to accept it , but to approach other s idea also can help you have variety of ideas .i beleive that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first of all , leaning other s ideas and concepts prevents from becoming a self-centered person .in fact , how you interact with your classmates and teachers in school has a huge impact on the way of thinking .if you are more likely to wonder the process of the result , you would be able to think a lot more than others who just want to know facts .knowing facts is also sufficient , but the point is that just learning facts can develop your knowledge and earn good scores on exams , but you would not gain the ability to think more deeply .as a result , when you became an adult and worked , you would not be able to adapt to a society you belong to .it is valuable to know how to exhange the ideas when you are a studesecondly , creation is more important that knowing facts .by understanding ideas and concepts would help you find new ways , and create new things .if you know only one way to think about things , you would not innovate anyhitng .in conclusion , with these two views , i strongly agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
