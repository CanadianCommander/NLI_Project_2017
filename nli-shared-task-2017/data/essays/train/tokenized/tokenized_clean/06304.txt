i believe older people enjoy their lives as much as young people do .even though many people consider energetic and passionate young people tend to enjoy their lives much more than older people , i can see many old people who love their lives and are content with their current lives with great happiness in tranquil peace .my grandparents , for example , enjoy their days and make themselves busy through participating in voluntary works and travels .my grandparents retired three years ago from their workplaces .after quitting their jobs , they tried to find new voluntary works in order to keep themselves busy and enrich their lives .as a volunteer at a local hospital , my grandmother worked to help people to get direction because the big hospital has a quite complex structure .meeting new people and kindly helping strangers to the hospital are her jobs , and she really enjoys doing it .my grandfather , on the other hand , found a voluntary position at a local thrift store .he rearranges new coming donation goods and helps the workers at the share-thrift store .since many people use the store , he is busy and he told me he wanted to share his ability to work with the society where he belong to .last summer , my grandparents took a trip to egypt .since they had already retired , they were free from the duties from their workplaces and able to arrange their dates without any concerns .now they can fully enjoy their trips .my grandparents were eager to visit one of the ancient civilization places , egypt , and experience the exotic landscapes and trees in the middle east .they showed me their pictures in front of pyramids with excitements on their faces .they rode cammels in the middle of the bleak desert , and met egyptian people !they are planning to take a trip to thailand next summer and i can read the excitements on their faces .young people s life can be full of new adventures and challenges in business , while old people s life is peaceful and graceful , which is free from any hurry or heavy responsibilities .my grandparents told me they could enjoy and realize their true value of life through getting involved in their community without profits .when they were young , they did not know something meaningful in their lives because they were too busy working to earn money .but they told me they were enjoying their lives more than when they were young .while i was watching their happy faces and contentments , i believe old people enjoy their lives even more than young people do .
