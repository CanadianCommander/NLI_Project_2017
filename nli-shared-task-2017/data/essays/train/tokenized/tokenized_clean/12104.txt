i believe that young people enjoy life more than old people for several reasons .young people have more energy to spend becase thay are in good shape and they do nt have any physical problem .they can practice any tipe of sport and spend hours outdoor playing with their friends .they have a lot of free time due to the fact that they do nt work and that they do nt have to look after any kids .during this free time they can go aut to bars , pubs or disco and meet new friends .in addition to this they can also meet a girlfriend or a boyfriend and having romantic dinners .young people do nt have problems with moneys because they can always ask to their parents if they need them .using the parent s money they can buy a sail boat for the summer in order to enjoy the sea during the summer or they can buy a pair of ski for the winter time .during the summer school vacations they can also travel around the world using airplains or boats .they can , for example , organize a tour of all the main towns of europe .in every town they can try different restaurant , go to see concerts and drink all night long .when they are at home they can use internet to buy several items , meet new people and create their personal website .unfortunatelly they do nt spend part of their energy to help old people even if they know that in fourty years they are going to be old too .
