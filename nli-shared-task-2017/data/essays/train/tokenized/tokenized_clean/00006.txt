i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .why people use car ?because car is useful .it does not care time schedule , go somewhere directly , and can carry someting more than other trancepotaion .if people go someplace , people use some trancepotation .usually they have to care some trancepotation `` s time schedule , but if they use car , they do not care it .this is very useful .in addition , if people use a car , they can go somewhere directly , but if they use train or bus , they have to walk or transfer after arrive station or bus stop , so car is more useful than other transportation .furtheremore , if people have a lot of luggage or something , they difficultly carry on the train or bus .however , car can buring these .also , car can buring other people .for example , their children or friends .car is more useful then other transportation .it can decide use their request time , go someplace directly , and can carry many things .therefore , i think in twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today , but if someone find new transfar system , it will able to change .
