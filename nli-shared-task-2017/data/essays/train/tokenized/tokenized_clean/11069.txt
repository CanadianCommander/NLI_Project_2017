i agree with the idea that young people do not support their local community nowadays .there are two reasons why the young do so .first of all , the mobility of young people is supported by the economic power of their family .long ago , typical japanese life depends on their local community .under these circumstance , young people can easily help their local community because they are familiar with that region and have many friends and neighbors .in these days , young people tend to move for the seek of their ideal universites .they are isolated in the new region because no one knows him or her and no one informs them of the content of the activity held by the new community .this is the one of the reason why people keep a certain distance from the communities .another reason is that that young people seems to be not interested in the activities of the local community .there are various jobs and attractive activities in the country and even above the country .while the activities of local community are still the same , new jobs are apt to enchant the curiosity of the young .for example , in our city , the event of local community is the volunteer activity for local elder people , but our university look also looks for students who help the poor children in other country .if the cost and time and other condition is the same , it is obvious which is more attractive for students .in fact , our university hold many attractive program like this throughout a year .as i mentioned so far , young people do not spend their time in helping their community because of their mobility and their low attentions .and these tendencies will progress more rapidly in our future with the advent more attractive jobs and other international activities .
