this statement implies a double response for me .indeed in my essay i will give several reasons to show that i agree with this statement but there is also some reasons which make me think that older people can enjoy life more than young people .when we are young we have less resonsability so we make things without thinking of the consequences .for example , if we want to act dangerously , this is our own decision , we have not a family to protect .in this sense , young people enjoy life more because they have nobody to worry about .if they desire they can just have fun .we can also say that young people are more lead to do extraordinary things such as leaving a family and going in a place they do not know , just because it is a new experience .indeed most of the time they do not plan what they will do , they do not spend hours thinking about the consequences .they just live the present moment .however what is also true is that old people can enjoy life too .indeed they do but in a different way .they are happy with very little .for instance listenning the birds sing or staying in their home with their grandchildren .they have a greater maturity than the youngers ones have .so they do know care about details .they have lived a lot of things and pains .they are able to see the world with a distance so they can see what is important or not .this enables them to enjoy life .as a conclusion what i want to say is that we can not really say if young people enjoy life more than older people do .i would say that it depends on the context of our life .it depends also on the experience we had throughout our life .
