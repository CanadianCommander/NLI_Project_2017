how the student can undestand the ideas which are giving to him ?a reserch has aproved the phenomnen when they have done this in some schools they found that the students can understand the ideas from the concepts than learning ideas .in my opinion i think learning from concepts is better for many reasons such as , the student can explaint in his way , it will be in his momery vey long time , and he can add more details on it .the student when he undestands something he can explain it by his way .for example , if the student understood a theory or something complecated , he will simply can tell his classmate about it .also , he could answer any qustion about it .in brief , when you undestand something it s better than learning facts .undestanding an idea is agood method to memorise it in the future .otherwise , he will get it when it necssery for the sutation which he is in .furthermore , the student when he has the idea of the issue , he can add more details on it .he can inspire a new informatoin about the iossue and then he will have agood knowledg in his life because of his undertanding of the ideas .in conclusion , i agree that the student is better for him to understand the ideas than learning it because it happend for me alot and i recomandleu disagree to learn the facts .
