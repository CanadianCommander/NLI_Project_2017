nowadays we live in an era were the use of cars seems to be very useful and that we can not live without it .in my opinion , i think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today eventhough the public transport will develop enormously .firslty , the population of the world is growing considerably , this means that on the next twenty years there will be more people reaching the age of having the driving license .secondly , as the years go on , the prices of the cars will be lower , the new technologies makes posible to produce cars at lower prices .this will make posible that a major number of people achive to buy a car .you wont need too much money to buy a normal car .maybe , luxury cars wo nt reach to accesible prices , but normal cars i think that will .thirdly , it is shown that going on motorbike in the streets of the cities , the avenues , the autopistas is very dangerous .every year the number of dead people driving a motorbike increases enormously .people is taken conceuous that driving a motorbike is dangerous and that the possibility of having an accident is high .moreover , people will tend to prefear to drive a car that drive a motorbike .fourthly , eventhough the public transports are beeing improved in comfort , price , distance , etc .in twenty years it wo nt have developed so much to be able to not have a car and move around the city , country , world by public transport .cars will be yet necessary to do day a day things , and to move around the streets .to sum up , i think that twenty years are no so much to decide not to have any car , maybe in a future , if things change , and the public transport improves and makes more facilities to people may reduce the number of cars .but in a deadline of twenty years i think that all the factors that i have mentioned before will make to have more than today .
