in japan , some people think that young people give enough time to helping their communities recently .however , i agee with the idea that young people do not do that for the folloing reasons .first , young people nowadays have seldom opportunities to help their communities .for example , when i was a student of secondary school in 1990 , i lived in nagoya , which is the fourth largest city in japan .in nagoya , there were some rules in my communiy that people had to gather once a month , and had to pick up trushes on the roads near our community .young persons and children also required to attend the activity .it takes about two hours at one time , but i could contribute to the community .but now , there are no activity like that in my community and i hardly hear the existence of such an activity from my friends .this example demontrates that i strongly believe that there are not enough opportunities for young people to help their communities .second , young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities .for instance , when i lived in nagoya , the neighboors were so kind that there were many opportunities to meet them .i thought that the neighboors were close to me , and that the community was important for me .i always wanted to help my own community because i felt belonging to the community .but now , the neighboors become more far away because people like to spend time more with their friends rather than with their neighboors .in addition , a sense of privacy increased now , people tend to keep a distance from their neighboors .this example clearly shows that young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities .therefore , i definitely agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities recently .
