i believe that , it is never good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .you always get the best when you specialize in one specific subject .specializtion in one particular subject that helps you build your career will not only bring interest during the study but will also give you the satisfaction when working through it .first let me state that generally all the subjects are vast , and studying these vast subject in which a person is not interested may lead to improper knowledge about the subject .as an old saying saying says `` half knowledge is always dangerous  , it would turn dangerous .furthurmore no person could cover all the things in all the subjects in a given academic time .practically , a doctor has to go through those subjects that are totally different from what a biologist go through .a doctor has 5 years of academic time to study and master all the things about the human body and a biologist has around 3-4 years to study about all the animals .now if a person thinking to have a broad knowledge and knowing all the subjects in this 5 years , is it possible for the person to master either of these ?he would neither become a perfect doctor nor a good biologist .in general keeping academic time aside , interest of person matters a lot .he must be focused on what he is interested .most of the people they will not be interested in all the sujects , say , i never liked math and programming , i always liked biology , now will a person like me , will he be interested in learning all the other sujects effectively say math ?he will concentrate on only those subjects that yield him benefit , its like when a person goes furthur in his career would the other subjects really help him ?its mere waste of time , if this time is utlilized for improving his knowledge in the field he is interested , this would help him better for his career , and in career job satisfaction is always much more important than any other thing .let us consider a biotechnologist , his work is discovering new vaccines , relating pathology etc. , if he would have learned law during his academics would that thing really help him in any way ?there are other people who can do that job efficiently than this person who is not at all interested in doin that job .so for this reason too i say that having proficiency in a particular subject is always better than wasting time in learning all the unnecessary stuff and having a broad knowledge of the academic subjects .finally , the implications in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but its really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that helps him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspects .its always good be a master instead of calling ourselves `` the jack of all trades but master of none  .
