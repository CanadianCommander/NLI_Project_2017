success lies in what you have thought of and the respective positive outcome .success is a phenomenon usually that should be developed by each and every individual .success reflects the idea of the man in his behavior .success should always come taking on new things in life .to say perfectly a sucessful person is one who succeds in trying out new things and plans .trying out new things is definetly related with risk taking .as complicated the plan will be risk accosiated with it will also be high .its not great on implementing the older ideas but to go on for self associated ideas .fear for failure should not be associated otherwise it will reflect on your work .for example if scientists does not go for newly generated ideas many familiar inventions wuold not have been possible .such as computers , cellphones , telivisions etc.the amount of risk associated with it is also high .if suppose if a batsman thinks of hitting a six as a risk then he ca nt ever succed in his life .accordingly if he plays without fear many milestones would be crossed by him .so both name and fame will be associated with him through out his life .so generation of new ideas and the amount of risk associated with it gives greater chance to develop in life .this not only supports for development in life but also raises respect for us in the human society .majorly successful people are recognised due to implementation of their own ideas and the risk associated with it .instead many people want to succed copying other ideas and implementing on the well known fact .but success counts on new ideas and the risk factor .hence success accuont on the people who work hard to succed which is reflected in their ideas .
