i totally disgree with this statement since it is completely unfaithfull to reality .we all know that the world population is gradually growing to its extreme .of course , and unfortunatelly , this means a consequential growth of many things , such as cities , houses , polution and waste .that in twenty years fewer cars would be running through our highways seems trully hard to believe .it makes sense , more people , more cars .this is the real statement we should bear in mind , and specially when dealing with today s materialistic society , eager to adquire more and more without caring about any consequence .cars , people say , are the reflection of one s own whealth , and the better it is or the more you have seems to say much about your self .luckily , nowadays the concept ecologism appears to be more settle in our society than a few decades ago .we could say that the human being is , through time , more and more conscious about his environment , something that undoubtfully changes our bad behavioir towards nature .public transportation should be of a daily use in our society since it sure helps to reduce the polution generated by single cars .it is a perfect way to move through the city while meeting interesting people .we still have much to do about this issue , but i believe a change is possible .maybe not in twenty years , nor probably in 50 , but in some future period the use of cars should be radically reduced .
