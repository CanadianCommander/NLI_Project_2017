i agree in this following statement .in twenty yeas no body knows what will happen to us .maybe there will not be any cars or may be there will be more cas than we have right now in our time .there are many stuff in the world that has not been discovered yet .and no body nows about them .in my point of view there will be many discoverings will happen that maybe more than the three fourths of the worls wo nt believe that this is discovered .i would like to be there in that time and also whants to do stuff that i never dreamed of doing with these new discovered stuff .i suppose that instead of cars , in twenty years there will be cars that could fly .if that happens i would like to live and see that before i die and also like to try it also .
