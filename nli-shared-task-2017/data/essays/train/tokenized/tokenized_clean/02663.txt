i definitely agree that successful people are more willing to try new things and take more risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because they are not affraid of changing , they have more chances , and they know that you need to take risks to find new ways , they can become successful people .first of all , successful people are not affraid of changing what they already had .they do nt stay still and they always want something new .success often comes with something different from the established ones .for example , the success of the website of youtube  is because it s new and unique .therefore , it grabs everyone s attention .if people always do things that they knew very well , their lives will be all the same .successful people are willing to try anything new and find new things that help them succeed .furthermore , because successful people are willing to try new things and take risks , they have more chances to succeed .they do nt have limitations .therefore , they have more opportunities than those who always do the same routine things .in addition , successful people know that every investment has its own risk and life is full of risks .in fact , they love to roll the dice , and to see what will happen next .that s why life is so special .you never know what will happen next .it may take you to the successful life , and it may take you to the totally failure as well .during the process of trying new things , successful people always gain some valuable experiences which help them become more successful .to sum up , successful people are not affraid of changing their lives and are willing to try new things .they take risks and they do nt worried about losing what they ve owned .during these trials and errors , they always gain some experiences which make them successful in the future .
