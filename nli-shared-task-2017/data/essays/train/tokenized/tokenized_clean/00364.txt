i am convinced that it is beneficial to specialize in one specific academic area once a general understanding of other areas is achieved .if we look back into history , we can find many scientists that were great in a wide variety of subjects .today , this can not be achieved anymore .while back then , there were still many things to be discovered and it was possible to have a broad knowledge of and do research in different academic fields , today s scientists have to specialize to be able to do research on a specific topic .and this research can be very important to society , leading to a better understanding of topics .for example , without research it would be impossible to find cures for diseases .now nobody could do medical research before specializing in this specific area .i agree that it is important to know about a variety of things .in fact , the public school system should provide a core understanding of science , arts and humanities .but on a professional level we need to specialize in order to be successful .this is easier to explain when looking at music .would you rather listen to someone that can play drums , the guitar , the piano and the violine , but is not great at neither of them or listen to someone play one of these instruments with perfection ?one person also can only play one instrument at a time .look at the dave matthews band , `` america s greatest band  , as the rolling stone magazine judged .all members know their instrument to near perfection .that is the main reason for their popularity and their sold-out tours year after year , not the fact , that they are able to play all instruments equally well .this also applies to many other areas .another great example are sports .a football team needs players that are specialized in throwing , catching , running , blocking etc . .of course it is important and even necessary for every player to have a basic understanding of the game , but if you want to be successfull you need to have players that are great at their assignments .overall , a linemen put into the position as place kicker would most likely lead to a catastrophy .all these examples show that , while learning about the basics of different subjects , it is important to find out where your special talents are , to pursue them and specialize in them .
