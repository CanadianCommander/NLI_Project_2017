in the last twenty years we are complitely driven by the power of the economy .it is for this reason that it is not really important the quality of a product but it is important the message that that product gives .it often appens that we become complitely blind when we are buyng something .infact we buy some product only because we have seen it on television even if we really do not need it .i can say that because it also appen to me .two days ago watching the television i decided to buy a porticular product usefull for making sport because it helps you to get back your energies after the phisical effort .i play basket with my friends during the weekend , firs of all during the saturday afternoon and we play for four or five hours long .that is way i need that product but i bought it even if i did not know what it was composed of .i thing that this sistm is very dangerous because the products controls are not accurate ant the final consumer is always the one who risks .today it is not imprtant what do we buy but it is only important the economy developing .i think that in order to eliminate this problem we should pay more attention on the controls that the government shold do when allow anvertisement to do damns .now i also remember that last year , during the winter holidays , i went with to the market of my town whit my mother and there was a lot of people in front of a shop because they all wanted to buy a particoular cristmas food .we also bought it just because we watchd an advertisemet , thinking that it was good .however when we came home we took it for dinner but it was disgusting .the problem was that we should have test it before .
