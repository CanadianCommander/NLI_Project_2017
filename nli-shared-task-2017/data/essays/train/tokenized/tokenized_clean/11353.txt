iam in complete agreement with this statement .nowadays , young people are not devoting sufficient time to helping their communities .there are several reasons why i believe so and i shall put forth some of them .i shall also try to cite some reasons why i believe such a behavior is prevalent today .there are several examples that illustrate the declining devotion to the communities .earlier in india , there used to be a lot of institutions that used to help out the poor people .a primary example is the service institute run by mother teresa .but such instances are on a rapid decline these days .in our school , we were required to complete 20 compulsory hours of community service , where we had to teach illiterate people , young or old .to me , this presented us with an excellent opportunity of putting our knowledge to good use , doing something that would benefit our community and our country .but a lot of students used to bunk these classes and used some unfair means to put in the attendance .as a result , this requirement of community service was removed after we passed out , which clearly illustrates the feeling the young people have towards their communities .it is true that a number of institutions are coming up in india that aim to help out the elder members of the society .this might be considered to be a positive development .but when we look closely , we notice an alarming fact .why are these institutes needed .the reason is that young people do not stay around to help and support their parents .the parents , when they get old , need some help , and since their own sons/daughters are not around to help , they seek refuge in such institutions .this demonstrates the level of selfishness that prevails amongst the youth of our country .to me , my community also comprises of my family members , relatives and neighbors .people have even stopped caring for their parents these days .lot of students graduate and go abroad and then forget their parents .they do nt come back , do nt enquire about their health and do nt send money that their parents may require .selfish attitude has become prevalent in the indian society these days , where you do nt care for anyone else but for yourself .the parents , who have sacrificed so much in bringing you up , are not given the respect and attention they deserve in old age .little can one expect the youth to go around helping the communities they belong to .if we look closely , we might be able to find the reasons why young people are neglecting their communities these days .the world has become extremely competetive and as a result , people need to work a lot harder than those of say 50 years back .the competetion has become very stiff and as a result , a lot of time has to be devoted for personal things like studying for various exams , working overtime at work places , etc .so , the increasing competetion might be one of the major factors why young people do nt devote enough time for their communities these days .increasing job opportunities abroad might also be a reason for this kind of behavior .the kind of money that is offered in some jobs abroad is extremely tempting .young people flee from their countries , never to return .they become intoxicated wth the new way of life and forget all their obligations towards their parents , friends , relatives and their other communitites .thus , in my opinion it is true that the young people of today are not devoting enough time , if any , in helping out their communities .
