many academics believe that it is more important for students to analyze and understand concepts and ideas rather than to study facts .in this essay i will examine whether the benefits of just understanding the ideas outweigh the possible advantages of learning facts .firstly , one argument that many people state in favor of the above mentioned opinion is that if you know the idea then you will be able to adapt to a different situation and to apply it to new circumstances .in other words , only if you analyzed the concept then you will be able to use it to new situations .the mere knowledge of facts does not help in this case since they are only characteristic of a certain point in time and can not be applied universally .secondly , it could be argued that only the knowledge of ideas enables you to develop new ideas .facts are static whereas ideas are dynamic .you can look at ideas and concepts from different angles and play with them .out of this dealing with a concept a new , further developed idea or system of ideas might be generated .mere facts are not open to such a proceeding , they can only be acknowledged .thus , because of these persuasive arguments the opinion of the academics seems to be correct .however , the importance of the knowledge of facts can not be underestimated .in most of the time an idea can only be understood if you know the facts on which it is based .most of the ideas are born out of a specific situation which is essential for the understanding of the idea .furthermore , an idea can not be further developed if you do not know anything about its origin .you would not be able to apply it to a new situation and surrounding .in conclusion , although there are several strong arguments in favor of the opinion mentioned above i believe that the knowledge of the idea and of the facts are equally important .both ideas and facts are intertwined with each other and can not be separated .thus , in my view students should study concepts as intensely as facts .
