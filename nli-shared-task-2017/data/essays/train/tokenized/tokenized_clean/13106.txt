it is generally said that when traveling somewhere we need a group led by a tour guide .although a group or a tour guide would give some benefits , however , i definitly belive that the best way to travel is to do alone , because traveling with a group led by a guide is too costly and time consuming .above all , the cost of travel in a group and a tour guide supplied by tour companies is extremely expensive .i experienced that before traveling the osaka in japan , the tour company that i chose suggested different options , if i added the tour guide to my travel , the tour company required almost twice cost as another which did not include guide .eventually i chose traveling alone and could buy presents for my family and friends with extra money while abroad .moreover , nowdays we have a lot of resources about the tour informatation such as books in the library and internet that do not require any cost .with those methods , we do not need to expensive guides anymore .second , within the schduled courses suggested by tour guide , people can not enjoy the travel entirly .as each person has different tastes during the travel , naturally there are differences that members want to look at .for example , when i traveled over the europe with my family using package program desined by tour company , i felt uncomfortable because i wanted to stay in paris longer while others did not want .unfortunately i could not make schecule changed , i should leave paris in short times with unsatisfactory .in conclusions , i disagree with the statement that a group led by a tour guide gives tourists most beneficial method , for the reasons that i mentioned above .traveling with a group or a guide contributes a lot of stressful cost and it is wasteful in time-wides .
