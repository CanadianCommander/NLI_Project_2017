marketers usually tend to make advertisments for their products in order to achieve certain organiztional goals .theys use various kinds of advertisement methods such as tabloides , tv commercials , and much more .although these advertisements are important i think that they are mostly exagorated compared to the products .first of all , we have to keep in mind that these advertisements represent the a method to attract customers and make them buy this product .in other words , the marketers job is to obtain the profit rarther than satisfying the customer s needs .second , alot of advertisments like tabloides exagorate when showing their advertisemts .for example , the fast food chains usually use bigger images in their tabloides compared to the real size of the meals .this way they attract customers and give them a wrong idea .andt is known that the advertisement usually works on the mental part .also , detergents like cleaning detergents , shampoo s , toothpastes and others .usually focus on special aspects while they are actually of same features since a cleaning detergent is a cleaning detergent .nowadays , marketers are not making advertisements to show features , but in fact it is nothing more than a battle with the competitor in order to win the customer therefore , they ll do any means neccessory in order to gain the customer , and i believe people nowadays are aware of these things and should nt take it seriously most of the times .in conclusion , people should nt believe all the advertisents they sea in th road or on tv because it s not true everytime
