it is often said that one should be good at a special field .however , i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .the main reasons are that modern society require students to a lot of special skills and many specific subjects are beneficial for students to get a job .to begin with , today s society demand students for a wider variety of skills such as economics , langages , sports .although student had to give up so many things llke as he spend time playing with friends , studying many academic subjects compensate for his future life .for example , these days are more and more globalized , many students are able to speak a couple of foreign langages such as english , chiness , japanese .in addition , a student with many special research areas tend to easily get job that he want to work .for instnace , last year , my cousin entered the samsung , which is one of the world famous companies because he had majored several subjects while university .his research fields are economics , eletronic engeneerings which impresses on interview in conclusion , i strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects are better than speciallizing in one specific sugject becaus current society require students many skills and most firms consider into student s various subjects .
