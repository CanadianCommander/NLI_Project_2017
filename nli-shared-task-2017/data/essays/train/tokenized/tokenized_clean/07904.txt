as far as i am concerned , i am not agree with the statement at all that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are many reasons that i do not like the group led travel , and i will just explore the most important ones here .the first reason i want to bring forward is that travel in a group led by a tour guide is so limited , not only the space but also the time .usually , the trace of this kind of travel has been planed before the travel begins .so you just take a limited glance at some places you want to visit , which just decided by the tour guide .there are always more places that will atractive your eyes beyond the tour guide s thought .another aspcct is about the time .it seems unwise not the follow the tour guide as near as possible , or you will fall behind .because the time of the travel depond on the tour guide instead of you .another reason , which is also commonly considered , is that the travel in agroup led by a tour guide is always in the holiday .for some aspect , it is not bad .however , travel in the holiday will cause many problems .it is obviously that the tour places are rather crowed during the holidays .if you want to take the group led travel , you just can avoid the unpleasant situation .what is more , as a result of the rush of the holiday travel , many accidents are easily to take places .in addition , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not a good idea for family travel .in the modern society , people pay more attention to the time spent with family menbers .if you choose to travel with your family indepedently , you will find it is much easier to enjoy the life along with the travel .for the reasons above , it is surely that i will travel without the tour guide .it is just realize the mean of the travel ---- for fun and pleasure .
