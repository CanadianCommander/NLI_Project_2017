most advertisements are making products seem much better than they are even thoug others are not .firstly , i used some products which was not as useful as it was in the commertial .secoundly , most advertiesments are showing increadable usage of their products .that is why i think most advertisements are making their products seem better than they are .i used some make up products in order to relieve some skin problems .its advertisement was very good prapere becouse it was shown as a really good product .however , when i tried it , it did not work well .most of advirtisements are the same .when people use them , people see that they are not as good as they were shown inin addition to this , most of the advertiesments are showing many increadable things and most of them do not seem true .for example , a acne cleaning jel advertiesement is showing how the product is effective .the advertiesment is telling that acne problem will disappear in 1 week .this is not posiable .even though people who has acne problems use increadably good product , acne problem can not disappear in one week .on the other hand advertisers are using some famous stars in order to make their advertisers better .even though they use famous people i do not believe this kinds of advertiesments .that is why i do not prefer to buy products have this kinds of advertisements .
