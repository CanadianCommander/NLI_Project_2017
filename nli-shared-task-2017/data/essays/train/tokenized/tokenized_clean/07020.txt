today , it is enough for a lot of students to learn facts about certain issues and topics only .in my opinion it is not enough to learn facts only .a student has to focus on how to understand an idea and a concept .first of all , a student should understand an idea to build up his own opinion .he gathers ideas of several people and tries to make up his own mind .understanding the idea gives the student oppurtunities like duscussing about it and create other ideas .another important point is the understanding of a concept .when a student understands a concept he can transfer this pattern to other issues and compare and contrast them or add information .also , he can modify different things which he does nt like about it .learning facts does nt give students the possibility to consider whether a fact is good or not .he just learns it and doesnt even think about it .in contrast , understanding ideas and concepts allows a student to discuss and talk about it because he has enough information about a topic .beside this , a fact is not modifyable that means that a student might talk about it but he ca nt add information .a fact represents statistics or particular issues which ca nt help students to transfer ideas or concepts on other things .understanding ideas and concepts make it possible to spread out your knowledge on other fields .for example , a student should be able to use the ideas and concepts , which he learned during the lessons , to create other sentecnes in a exam .
