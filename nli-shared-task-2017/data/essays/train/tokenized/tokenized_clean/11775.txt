i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is safer , the best touristic places are shown , and it can be cheaper .first of all , traveling alone can be very dangerous since you are in a place that you do nt now .some times even the idiom is strange to you .it s possible that by mistake you ended up in risky places where you can be assalted .these are some risks that people like me do nt want to have , so the answer for them is to travel in a tour .because tour s are composed of many people and are led by a local guide who knows the zone , you can be almost sure that nothing bad will happen to you .furthermore , lonely travelers have to ask for interesting places in each city they go .they will visit some places , but probably they will miss others .when traveling in a tour , all the places are known by the agency , and they usually give you the best of each town .you dont waste time asking for advice and you do nt miss important places .finally , although tour agencies seem to be expensive .in my opinion , they ended up being cheaper .when you travel by yourself , you can make some good deals .nevertheless , very often people are cheated by local sellers , and they do nt become aware of this because they simply do nt what is the correct prize .these events never happen in tours .they know where they work , and the correct prize .thay charge you some extra money for this knowledge , but it s worth it .overall , i prefer to travel with tour agencies because an important thing to me is to play safe in my trips along with the fact that i do nt like to miss any interesting spot .in addition , tour agencies end up being cheaper .
