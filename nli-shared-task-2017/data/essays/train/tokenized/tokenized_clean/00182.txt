in this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people s lives .first of all i have to say that i was born in this generation where the industry more or less can not survive without advertisements .from sharing experiences with my mother and reading magazines from the  sixties  , even back then advertisements played a big role in selling products .i agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that s the best way to win customers .human beings of course , only want to see , touch , feel , smell ..etc. the best a product can offer with the senses god gave them .regardless of the fact that a lot of products have disadvantages , people are prone to be blinded by the beauty and the advantages of the product itself .for instance , a simple product like  soap  , has to fulfill its purpose .as a young lady i want to have soap that smells good , looks good , a kind of soap that smoothens or even whitens my skin .it is proven and i have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not .the low amount of customers that read this information stroke me .all what people want is what gives them a good impression in any art of media .newspapers , magazines , posters , tv and radio advertisements will try to do their best in this competitive world market .in order for a product to seem better , advertisement companies would do everything to attract people .as i have mentioned there is great competition in the market .and i have learned during my highschool time of strategies advertisements take .for instance , if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular , like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eyes of the viewers by wearing  nike shoes  .if one person buys those nike shoes , everybody else will .that | s how we people are .i am aware that advertisements are exagerated and sometimes full of lies but i can not deny that i am a victim of this trend .
