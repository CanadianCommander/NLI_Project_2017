well , i disagree , because both options are important for a complete learning .imagine an education that consist only in ideas .it would be incomplete , because the ideas are always changing , a phenomenon that increase in a world like this , where the global communications are very efficient and we are exposed to a lot of information from a very diffents persons and ways of life .so , we do not have to concentrate in that type of education , base it only an ideas and concepts .but , in the other hand , an education base it only in facts is not good enought , because in the future , and maybe in the near future , the things that we consider true may change , and sometimes that occurs in a radical way .for exemple , some years ago , a scientist does not have the knowledge of the genoma , so he believe that a disease can not be cure .nowadays , the medical treatments are better , because of the study of mothers cells and the genoma .the key world in this teme is changes , because all the human knowledge is in risk of change .the persons in the ancient world think that the world were plane , and the other planets and the sun moving around us .in accord of that , the earth was the center of the system , but that fact change with the discover of new facts .it happens the same with the ideas , they are always changing and the human race can not stop that process , because it is natural and normal .we can not imagine a a world without changes , we live because the world change .we , for example , also change .when we have kids we were afraids about things that in the present day we do not .we can laught about the fears o the past , and the way they ruled of behavior .when we are in love , for example , we can imagine the world without that person , the person we love , we do not wanna to even imagine that .but , oh , what a tragedy ! , when a relationship ends , and sometimes that happens in the worst terms , we can resist that person .a simililar process are involve in politics and other elements of our society , in constant move and change .the human evolution is a history of contradiction and false promises and we can not be sure about a lot of things .for all that , our education must involve facts , but also the crafts for understand the changes of that facts , and those crafts are the concepts and the ideas .
