at first , there are a great people said that : to be or not to be , that is a question .i still remembered this words , it makesme do not be lazy and should be still work hard .for my opinion i would like to say i agree the statement .there i would like to give ome short story .i do not konw whether the people had read a famose book name is `` who touch my cheese ?if yes .i think they will understand me .the book talking about two mouses and two small people they like ates cheese very much .the mouses they are animals , so the only can smell .but the people they are very claver .the can depends their mind to find where are the cheese .one day .they were found the cheese will be finished .the are tinking about the future what theycan eat .the mouse immidietely left their house and go outside to looking foe there new house where have kinds of cheese when they found the cheese not have anymore .but the two people still set down the old place to waiting and dreaming .they dreaming for one day a lots of cheese appeard in the old house which the house they feels good .they still fall in the beautiful memorise and lost the confidences to got out and looking foe the new place .at the end .of course the mouses find a new place first .and the one of the small people find another one .the one people study a lot through the process .he think do not be afriad the risk in the future , maybe still do not have cheese .they will successed if they hold on their confidence .the people can not stop when they already successed for something .they still nedd work hard to continue , even there are tome risks in the future .but that can make people go the higher steps and more seccessful .
