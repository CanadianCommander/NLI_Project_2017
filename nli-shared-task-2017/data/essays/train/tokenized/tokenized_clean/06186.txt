travelling is one of the most exiting things in the world .however , it is not possible to travel everyday in one s entire life because of both time and money constrains .therefore , in one of the rare occations that a person travels , it is important to plan the trip in the most enjoyable way .while some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i prefer to travel alone or with only family members or friends .below , i will discuss the reasons behind my preference .it is true that when you go to a new city or country , you need someone to take you around an show you what famous sceneries are in the city .however , these may not be the places that i would want to look at .everyone is so unique in the world , so everyone has different interest .what the tour guide shows me may represent the preferenc of the majority , but it may not be my preference .therefore , when i travel , i would prefer to do my own research on the city , so that i will know what i like about the city or country and go visit these interested places .moreover , this way can make me know the visited city more .on top of the different interests people may have , travelling time is another problem that may arise when you are travelling with a group led by a tour guide .it is simple to illustrate this point .to a tour guide , it is a job to take you around the city , so he will only work during his working hour which is usually from 8 am to 5 pm .however , to me , travelling is one of the rare treats that i have , so i would like to make it as enjoyable and long as possible .i would not like to go back to the hotel at 5 oclock and go to bed .instead , i would like to explore how the city is like at night or after the tour guide s working hour , but i can not just ask the tour guide to work overtime .besides different interests among people and difficult scheduling of travel time , privacy is another main reasons that i would like to travel without a tour guide .in some occations , travelling is a chance to spend some private time with partner , family , or friends .therefore , it is not always comfortable to travel with a tour guide .travelling is such a nice treat to any one , so making it interesting , flexable in scheduling and private is crucial .therefore , i would prefer not to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
