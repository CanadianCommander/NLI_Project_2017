it is difficult to agree or disagree with this statement .if people enjoy their lifes or not , depends most of the time on their character and their living circumstances .these circumstances can be bad for young pepole as well as for older people .but i rather think older people enjoy their lifes more than the other way round .most of the time young people do nt have as many responsibilities as older people have .older people are limited by their job , their family and other tasks .on the other hand the job and the family can be very fullfilling for the older people and therefore make life more enjoyable .due to a lesser amount of responsibilities younger people can do what they want and like .this greatly contributes to more joy in life .but there are examples where this does nt hold true .a relative of mine who is 58 years old quit his job with 50 and is now living a very fullfilling and enjoyable life with less responsibilities than even the young people have .another thing which contributes to a more enjoyable life of older people is that they can value good times more than the younger because of their experience .most of the older people went through bad times in their lifes and so they can value smaller things more than young people do .furthermore they know better what they like in life .young people often do nt know what the like .they are unstable in their emotions and tend to be depressed over small things .on the other hand older people are often less open to try new things .therefore they might miss activities or experiences which they would enjoy very much .in summary it is difficult to say who is enjoying his life more , younger or older people .i think it depends very much on the character of the person itself .but when i had to decide between the two , i would choose the older people .
