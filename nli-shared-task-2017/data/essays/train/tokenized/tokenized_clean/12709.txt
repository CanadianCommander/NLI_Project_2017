community is defined as a place where the people of varied cultures , ideas , opinions abide together .and this community should be well guarded from the negative impacts and evils of the society .and the young people are those who are the backbone of any nation s progress and these people should come forward in helping their community , and protecting it from such bad evils and further improving it .and i competely agree with the given statement that younger people of the present generation do not spare enough time in helping their communities .as the today s man lives in technological era , busy with his quite hectic schedules and various other activities he never finds time in helping his community .and rather he uses his leisure time in various activities which fetch him a lot of fun and entertainment .as he is equipped with all the latest tecnologies in almost all the areas right from playing games to educational programs he is least bothered in helping his community .and he finds a great passion in riding bikes .going to shopping malls , movie theatres and many more recreational activites .and further he is in craze with the latest trends in clothing , bikes , cell phones and with the celebreties and movie actors and as he is bounded by this shade of ideas he never gets into the idea of looking over community .on the contrary , sometimes young people too find time in organising events in the community halls provided in the community in order to improve the facilities in the community and they also initiate many awareness programs in the community .and thus finally , we can easily conclude from the above given information that young people never find time in helping their communities .
