personally i agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .there are three amin reasons for saying so .first , becuase they are young , they are physicaly tough and healtheir than older people .they can enjoy physical sports such as soccer , futball , etc .on the other hand old people have less stamina and they will have to stop even if thy want to go on .their joints , bones and musles are weaker , causing injury .this will stop them from most of the sports that they like and enjoyed when they were young .so they wil think back to the days when they were young and feel that they would like to go back to that days .secondly , younger people have better looking than older people .as we get old , our skin will be not smooth , there will be less hair , etc .so they even enjoy thereselves , their own looking , but once they are old they will not be satified by their own look .their wife or husband will look hansome or beautiful when they are young .this might not be true for everyone , but partners will look at each other and think he/she are not good looking as he/she was / this now-days leads to a devorse of couple .the number couples devorsing when they get to middle ages is increasing .that questions whether they married to each other becuase they loved the partner of loved the look of partner .finally , there will be more friends when people are young .i might sound too realistic , but as people get old they pass away and there will be less people that you know of .my grandparets are saying that in every class union , there will be less people .either they are physically unable to attend or they had passed away .this is similar to the fact that there will be less friends , but also there will be less family members or relatives .so they will feel lonely and left out when all the family members and close relatives are gone .i might be able to come up with more reasons , but i will stop here .it sounds just too sad to talk about it .i will be old some day and i am getting older every year , although i am still young .i heard from some people that they want to die before they get really old , becuase they can not `` live  with the situation that they would be in when they are old .i hope that this is not teh way i should be .i hope i will be able to enjoy my life as much as i am enjoying now .as long as god keeps me alive , i will thank him and live my life following his words .i think that not enjoying the life or even feel like want to die , is an act of cursing god .i am a christian , so i want to be able to thank god and enjoy anytime .but i have to admit that i would enjoy better if i am young .i really love sports , so i would really miss playing soccer , tennis , table tennis , badminton , etc .well i got a bit off the road but this is how i think about the topic .so from these reasons , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older peopld do .
