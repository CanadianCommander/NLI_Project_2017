to my mind it is not correct to say that one had to take every risk to be successful .maybe it is easier to become famous with a revolutionally idea and a change or even break of common rules but i think it will also work with traditionally methods if you are qualified enough .the phrase `` nothing ventured , nothing gained  might be correct in some situations of life but i think if you make up relevant and important desicions too quick and without thinking carefully about it you can easily stap in a trap .of course you should not be stubburn and close your mind against every new technology or invention .to be open-minded is one of the most important characteristic in time of globalization .but i think that it is even more important not to forget our roots and listen to old people with their long year experiences and the wisdom they get through it .i will present an example out of equesterian sports .during the last twenty years a mass of new , different , alternative and better methodes become popular through the mass media .but if you see the work of a traditional trainer you often observe better success in the end .if someone tries everything new , he/she can not focuss on one method once .and the horse you work with will be irritated .so try out everything and take every risk is the wrong way here .if you risk everything you also can loose everything and if you built up your life on solid , traditional bottom without taking every risk you do not reach everything but you also did not loose what you already have .as a conclusion i say that sometimes it is better to do what you already know and do this perfect than always focussing on new thinks and take the risks .
