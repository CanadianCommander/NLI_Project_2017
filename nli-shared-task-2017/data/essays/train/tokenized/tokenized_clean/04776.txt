i disagree with the statement  it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject  .in case of broad knowledge of many academic subjects we need to study all the subjects and become familiar with all the topics in the subject .it is difficult task to do .where as in case of the case of specialize in one specific subject is an easy process to know abt the subject .in specializing one specific subject , we can learn more about the topic and we can learn very deeply about the subject and become a gem in that particular subject .when a person go to a job he just sees that in which stream or subject the candidate is more intelligent and the interviewer asks the quieries related to that subject only .interviewer sees the candidate that how much deep knowledge the candidate has in that subject .when we would like to do postgraduate courses we will be specizlized in a specific subject .specializing one specific subject is a good and easy process .we can get deep knowledge in the subject and do some researsh works related to that subject .as an example if a person is specialized in artificial intelligence , he can make many programs and make intellegen computer programs .he can write programs self .borad knowledge of academic subjects is we should learn all the subjects in the academic year .we need to grasp all the topics which is big problem .it is very hard to graspe all the subjects and a tuff task to remember all the topics and points in the subject .we can not be able to specialize in any field .it is difficult to understand each topic in the subjects and it takes much time to prepare all the subjects .it is not an easy task to have broad knowledge of academic subjects .broad knowledge of academic subjects is some what helpfull to shift to differernt streams and also different specializations .but we cany be perfect in any subjectthus specialization in one specific subject is better an we can deepen knowledge .broad knowledge doesnt help and we will not be perfectrt in
