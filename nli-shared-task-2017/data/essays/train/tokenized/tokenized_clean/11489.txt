from my point of view it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because of my own experiences .it does not make any sense if they learn facts , sometimes by heart , without understanding .furthermore , if they understand the ideas and concepts , they automatically learn them .in addition to that , they remember things , they learned by understanding better then without .moreover , what do they want to do with their knowledge , they learned once , without understanding ?they can not use it in their life .and students learn for their life and not only for their teacher .for exemple sometimes it is not important to know all the chronological years and events of the past by heart .it is much more important to know , why something happened and/or someone did ?another exemple which refers to that topic is the subject latin .i learn it in school since 4 years and we do not only learn a large amount of vocabulary to translate some texts into our language , but we also analyse the texts .today it is easy to make researches on the internet , by only printing something out , without understanding anything .you have the choice to learn everything without understanding , or you read everything carefully with understanding .as far as i am concerned the second way is the better one .all in all it is better for students to understand everything , then only learn them by heart .
