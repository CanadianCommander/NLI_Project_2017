my little sister is the most happy person in our family .she always play with her friends and toys .she is always happy .on the other hand my grandmother is very sad .every day she talk me about his health problems .some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i personally agree with this idea .these are my following reaons .first of all , the olders generally have health problems much more than youngers .body of older people does not have enough durability like younger s .for example my grandmother can not walk like my sister because my grandmum has some trouble with her foot .can she enjoy life more than my sister ?of course not .second , younger have a lot of things to learn in their life .on the other hand , older has been learn many thing in their long life period .for instance , any child at the age of 7 is very happy because of having a class first time .but the older never be happy because of that .last but not the least , older people have a lot of things that they have to do .for example , my mother always wash the dishes and help me about my homework .i am more free than her .i can play basketball or watch tv after the lunch , but she has to wash dishes after the lunch .she can not enjoy life like me because she has a lot of problem that must to be solved .all in all , i agree with the idea that older people enjoy life less than young people do .consequently , i am happy because i am young too .
