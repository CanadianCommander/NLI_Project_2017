traveling is one of the best ways to have fun and get more knowledge about other coultures or whatever new things .therefore , planning for any travel or small trips is very important element .and there is differents ways to plan for any trip .there is people who likes to travel with groups with tour guide that he or she can lead them very well in the traveling .and there is anothers who likes to travel by them selves and get the information by them selves , which it make more difficalte .actually i disagree that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .also i think it is works in some cases .but the reasons that made me disagree are , in any travel i think that is the best thing is to descover every thing by my self which i wo nt get that benefit with a guide .and also travelling with groups give me less porsnality which i do nt like .first , i uauslly travel to descover and get more information from other culturs and places .and i like to know know every thing by self , because it give feeling that i did good job .also to know every thing by my self needs to communicate with other people , and that communication it also consedered as a descovering .therefore , there is good things that i will get from my travel by my self that i wo nt get it with guide .whatever traveling my self give chalinges and that chalinges is the best things that i will remebar it from the trip .second , in of the important things that every body want it in any time is personalty .and this quallty is very important for me in any trip .it give the aplety to descover more and make me think only about what i should do , not think about what others need or what i should obey of rules with any group .therefore , that give more chance to be by my own and only think about ny self on this trip .finally , there are some places that every body needs tour guide such as visting specfice place and to know about many thing there .this kind of tours are usually temprorly and do nt take long time , so , i can that advantage beside that i can the eals by my own .
