i met a lot of successful people in my life .all of them have always tried new things and take risks .i agree with this statement .infact , in order to have success in life , is important trying new experiences .i think that the more you do in life , the more you learn .if you just do what you already know how to do , you will never succeed in your life .an example that can support what i wrote is the analysis of the attitude of one of my best professor : silvio abati .my oral medicine professor is a great person and he is very successful in the hospital and university where he works .many colleagues look for him when they do nt arrive at the right diagnosis for their patients .moreover he is very admired by his students for his interesting lessons .he often tells me how he had been able to become such a good doctor and teacher ! .when he was a student he had many school friends that studied just on one book , while he used to read more than one book and he always reviewed literature of a specific topics .he also went to meical meetings even if he could nt understand everything .to be sucessful in your work you have to increase your knowledge as much as possible without being afraid of risking .like my professor , many other scientists found out important discoveries just risking and betting on what they were doing .we have just one life so i think is important to exploit it as much as possible `` without any brake  .i d like to be a silvio abati in my life , and i will follow his advice !risk !
