nowadays , more and more cars are produced and sold .indeed , population is still increasing all over the world , developing countries are richer and richer asking for all we have in developed countries such as computers , buildings or cars .in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , even if everybody can thinks the contrary .today , we have many ways to go from one point to another .it means more buses , planes and cars of course .even if new kinds of transport could be built , cars will remain the best way to go to school , work and to go out because there are no a more convenient way of transport yet .that will be true for at least 20 years .moreover , more and more government and associations would like to decrease the number of cars due to the pollution .however , in the same time , more and more cars firms make research in developing new kinds of cars which could work with new ecological energies such as colza oil , electricity or else water .for the moment , they only experiment these kinds of energy , but some cars are know working with both petrol oil and electricity .other experiences are also being made but it is difficult to know if they are available and cheap .indeed , the problem is also that these new cars have to be bought by everybody , so much so that they have to be cheap or rather not too expensive .the last point i want to deal with is that developing countries are growing so fast that their needs are huge in new technologies and consequently in cars , because they also have to go to work .their needs will be much more important than in developed countries .indeed , in developed countries , we have sufficiently cars , although in china or in india , people who have enough money , and they are numerous now , want and need to have one .to put in a nutshell , cars will be more and more numerous in the world for at least twenty years .cars needs will decrease when new kinds of transport will be find or discover such as teletransportation or personal plane .
