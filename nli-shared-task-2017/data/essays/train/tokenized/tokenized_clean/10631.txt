advertisements is prevalent in our society .we can see a variety of advertisements surrounding us .i think , every person will be strikingly impressed by the colorful advertisements when television channels broadcast sports games , especially some very important games , such as the mba final contests .people do not spend much time on thinking whether advertisements will match what they advocate .they tend to follow the trend that advertisements have created .but from my experience , i find that most advertisements exaggerate the benfits of their products or hide their potential harms .but why do advertisements try to show us things that are actually not that good ?obviously , profits from products drive them to do so .particulary products that are assumed to cure or remove a chronicle diseases can be more attrative to us than others .manufacturers make use of our desire to spend money on these products .in addition , less work on administering and censorship of advertisement can easily lead to the appearance of false adverstisements .it s admitted that the language of advertisement is very difficult to control .sometims , a subtle tone can make advertisements much better in overpraising their products .however , from my understanding , the most important reason for this fact is that new media , for example internet , enter into our society .these new media always can find a way to escape our current laws and rules on advertisements .they figure out their effective methods to target a special group of people .for example , teenager can take predomiance of population that surf internet often .computer games companies try to exaggerate their products even by telling that games can make you more knowledgable and get you get high scores in your courses .the only reason is that games can make you think more .
