i agree with the statement that products seem much better than they really are .it is the commercial s job to present goods and services as good as possible .advertisment is an essential way to communicate with prospective but also already existing customers .we get information via different ways : tv , radio , newspapers and paper-walls along streets .marketers distinguish between dormant and already existing wishes .af part of their work is locating clients and find the best way to give them information about for example anew generation  of a certain product .imagine you enter a supermarket and just see food , drink and cleaning aids in neutral packages .people memorize and recognize products in an easier way by identifying a certain brand , especially when they are already familiar with a specific one .products are usually advertized either in an abstract environment , i mean just the perfectly photographed product with a bright-coloured background , or by offering it by attractive actors .brands tell stories , create a certain life-style .for example : is there a really amazing difference in taste between pepsi-cola and coca-cola ?i do nt really think so .ordering and having a coke provides a certain feeling , independent on the taste .what you see , is always an idealized picture .it is up to your choice whether you want to buy it at least once and try whether the content covers your imagination .but do nt be disappointed if maybe the package tells a different story concerning the packed good .another example : cars are not only buyed due to financial reasons , but also because they create an imagination for the driver to be sporty , in a certain way it means a method of showing status .to summarize i think we all know about the effect of advertisement , it is a comfortable way of getting news , but the elder we become the more concious we are about the effect .
