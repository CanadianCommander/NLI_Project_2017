travelin with a tour guidealthough traveling with a tour guide is interesting , but traveling alone is more fun because of many reasons such as , a tour guide is more expensive , the commitment with the tour guide , and speaking the country language is enough to travel .traveling with a tour guide is more expensive .nowadays , if people want to travel , they can find all the information about the place that they will go to in the internet or book guides .it is cheaper and they can discover the places by themselves .there is no commitment by traveling without a tour guide .i had a europe trip last summer and i travelled without a tour guide .i went there with my friends and we used the book guides it was really helpful and fun rather than traveling with a tour guide .because the tour guide have specific times that people have to follow , they are not quite interesting .speaking the country language is enough .my native language is arabic , and i like to visit arabic countries such as , egypt , united emirates , and lebanon .i always visiting a travel agent before i went to these countries and he gave me guides about the good places in these counitries , so i did not need a tour guide .on the other hand , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is interesing .people can learn more about the countries and the places if they have a tour guide .the tour guides can show the toursit all the historical places that they want to see , and they can explain the places for the tourist .they can save tourist time because they know the places , so they show the tourist many places in short amount of time .in conclusion , the best way to travel is different between each person .many people prefer to travel by themselves , and discover the places and live the adventure without a tour guide .this kind of tourist want to be free , so they can go any place at any time without commitment .
