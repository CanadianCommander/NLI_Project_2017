i agree with the statement and general idea that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they are .the reason for this lies in the reason for the existence of the advertisement itself .advertising is a tool used to lure consumer s into buying a product .given the means and tactics used to lure consumers and to make products more appealing , i agree with this statement .if a given product contains any minor flaw , this is never reflected in the advertising for it .consider the governments ratings for motor vehicles .not a single piece of advertising for motor vehicles would state things like `` rated most potentially hazardous vehicle in its class  or `` lowest fuel efficiency .in certain types of advertising , products may be accompanied by other things that make the product more desirable , but these things are not included with the product .this is intended to mislead and confuse any potential consumer .a perfect example of this can be found in nearly all advertising used to sell toys , specifically action figures .most kids are playing in very well crafted worlds with their action figures .however , the kids do not percieve or do not realize that the action figure will probably not be as much fun to play with in his or her living room .the consumer is mislead .any indication that only the action figures is the item at hand is relatively unnoticeable .blowing up and exagerating qualities and results is the most common method of making a product seem much better than it really is .infomercials make up most of this trend .they promise things that happen in a small number of cases but which are not generally the case .weight loss pills and medications are advertised using results that are atypical and are intended to mislead consumers .as we have seen with these three clear cut examples , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .they cover up or fail to mention any flaw with a given product ; they present products in a way in which they are much more appealing ; and the strongest evidence that supports this statement is exagerating it
