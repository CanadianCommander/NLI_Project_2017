some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .according to me this statement is true but not all young people do not give a help to the their communities .i live in an university college .my friends and me are very busy with exams , classes and laboratories .for example we are in the university from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm all the days !so we return to the college very , very tired !however , when we go back to the college we find time to help our community .for examples some student work in the college s garden , others help our secretary in the office , others help in the kitchen and so on .i think that if you believe in something you will find time to do it .i know , other student in my college do not help the community because they are out for all the day and go back to the college only for the dinner .they tell us that they have not time because they study all the day .but this is not a good reason , according to me .i have to study too !i want to pass all the exams and degree soon but i am in a college with other people and so i want to help my community because i think it is a right thing .today young people are busy in not important activities and so they have not time for important things , such as helping the community .in the feature i hope my sons understand this because helping community is one of the best thing we can do in our lives .
