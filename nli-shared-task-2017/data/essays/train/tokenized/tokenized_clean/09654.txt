as always , people have been enjoying their life in their own way and value .i think this is true kept constantly for a long time and for good from now .additionally , i belive that life is always joyful thing wherever it is over time .first , if anything this is a delighteing era unlike the period our parents got through the diffucult time in the past .there are many activities and the resources that old people can enjoy around us in this comteporary era .for example , we , recently can meet some movies focused on the old persons and it is most remarkable change of our culture considering the fact that the movies usually belong to younger people .and we can also know that there are many active communities built byr the old and for the old .these facilities , absolutely help them to enjoy thier life .secondly , i am compelled to emphasize the improvement and the development of medical area .this big improvement acheiving over time makes it possible that human can live longer enjoying their lives when they become older .personally , my father is 95 year old and my mother is also over ninety .even though they are quite old .they go out to play golf and swim regular basis .to tell the truth , i do nt need to even show my parents  case .probably , other people can also find old people who still enjoy active sports around them .i believe that all of these is possible due to the regular check up in the hospital and assistant of cutting edged medical science .thirdly , is it really true that young people enjoy life more ?of course , i admit they are usually healthier and have a lot of energy which is admontly advantegeous for enjoying life .but we also should know and realize that they are short on experience and some people are callow youth , which lead them to some mishaps and fall in to bad and serious temptation that are located in our society .for example , everyday we meet the news that young people ruin their life due to being footloose and the behaviors with abandon .so , younger age is not only good age for enjoying life but also careful age for avoiding the unpredictable results of enjoying their life .conclusively , i do nt agree the idea that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
