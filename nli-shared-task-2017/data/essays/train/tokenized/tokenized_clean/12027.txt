i do agree that the advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are .infact it is a art that has developed with new era and new technology .it is a means of atrracting their costumers to buy their product .advertising industry has grown for decades and still growing today .with the invention of computers grafics any product in the market can be made very beautiful and irresistable .the advertisement is eye catching and it gets registered into your mind .so when you go to the market , even if the product is not useful , you end up buying it only because the beautiful side of the product has been inculcated into your mind .lets take an example of a perfume .in the advertise the perfume bottle was in a shape of a lady and it was being used by jenifer aniston .t hat had registerd into my mind and i was wanting tho buy the perfume for a long time .one fine day i finall got a cance to go buy it .the price of the perfume was unbelievable , it was so expensive .but i wanted it at the image of jenifer holding the bottle just di nt go out of my mind , and guess what ?i finally ended up buying it .even today i regret to the purchase that i made that day as till today the perfume bottle is only half used as i no more like its smell .but that was a lesson for me , and today i keep control on myself and donat get waved away by such fantasies created by the advertisements .i realize that i am not the only one , there are millions of people who has had this kind of experience .but the key thing to ask is , do these people realise how they are trapped by the advertisement industry .i guess there would nt even be 1 % of the entire crowd who understands this strategy used by the advertisement agencies .this is one of the major reasons for the fast growth of the advertising companies .but ` yes  i do agree to the fact that the advertising agencies are doing a very good job and has a great effect on people s mind .
