nowadays people are discussing that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i think most people , including myself , do nt agree that claim .because it is superficial knowledge , doest help you for your job , you do take poor grades in the tests which is related to your major .also i can count several disadvantages about the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .although you learn a lot of knowledge .they are all superficial .for example , you are engineer and you took art class when you were in university .one day perhaps you will meet a painter and start to talk about artm .what will you say about art that attracts the painter .nothing , only you count the names of the artists .also this knowledge doe nt help you when you apply for a job or during your job .if you focus on your major more , you will be more succesful in your job .statics show that people specializing in one specific subject are more happy because they are more successful in their jobs .also successful work life means that a good profit for you , because successful men earn a lot of money from their job .if you focus on your major s lessons , you will be successful not only in your work life , but also in student life .that means you are killing two birds with one stone .you will be more successful in your lessons because you can make relationships among the knowledges .taking everyting into consideration , i can clearly state that specializing in one specific subject is better .special person make specializing in their subjects .thats my motto
