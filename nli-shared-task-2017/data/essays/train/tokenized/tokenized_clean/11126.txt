while it is always difficult to make such strong claims and there are for sure some exceptions , i overall agree with the statement .we are living today in a much more individualistic society than twenty years ago .i believe that the underlying reason is mainly economic .decades ago young students could aim for fairly reasonable job and access to decent housing without caring too much about their career .the situation is very diferent today .the list of requirements of accessing a good university , and ultimately a good job , is endless : languages , experiences abroad , extra-scholar activities related to your field , good grades to pass the increasingly selective filters , a renowed mba , etc .competition is getting harder and students have little time left else than for carefully planning their curriculum and career in order to outperform their peers .when i was a student , i for example added to my morning classes at the university extra daily classes in german and french , and used my summer breaks to travel abroad to hone my fluency in these and other languages .i had obtained the degree of camp counselor and used it a couple of times in camps with less afluent children .it was very rewarding from a personal perspective , but i decided to focus on my language skills .now with perspective , i wish i had helped more .i know that the situation is changing now and presenting extracurricular social activites may represent valuable earning points in the selection process at some universities and even with some employers .these experiences are a way of distinguishing the individual from the rest and stressing his or her personal value .i believe that government should encourage social activites by proposing alternatives which let students help the community while reinforcing their curriculum .as for example exchange programs where young people could help local communities abroad , honikng their language skills and at the same time fulfilling their wish to help out .i know now that these possibility exists , but the role of institutions is to promote them .should i have know about them , i had not wasted the opportunity !
