do you think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?people hold different views on this issue .actually , this topic is so complex and controvesial that it deserves careful consideration .in my opinion , i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .to begin with , the first reson to illustrate my point is that people will take public transportation system more often than today .rather than driving cars by themselves , people would take bus or mass rapid transit system to their destination for it is more convenient .take my home city taipei for example .instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hours , people in taipei prefer taking mass rapid transit system to commute .i think this will be a trend in the future .in addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using cars is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution .for fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy .moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using cars is a good method .since environment conservation is an important issue nowadays , i think not using cars is quite important .finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving cars , actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive .besides the expense of purchasing a car , it costs a lot to maintain and repair it .moreover , you have to spend a lot of time as well as money for parking your car .on the countrary , taking public transportation system is quite smart .therefore , i believe more and more people will choose taking public transportation system in the future .in conclusion , for the reasons mentioned above , i firmly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
