as we know , there are two methots to study .the first one is to have broad knowledge od many academic sibkects .the second one is to specialize in one specific subject , one has his own tast in studing , so let us talk about this subjectfor me .is depend on my own time , if i has big amout of time , i will choose the seconed method .becase if study in this way of cours , i will gante so much , i also will have alot of information the book i study .then i will be able to unsderstant all what the teacher will teach us .on the other hand , if i do nt have much time i will start my studing by the first way , which is all my acadimic subjects not in deply .becase this method will help to have some information abuut what my teaters will give us in my classs .but if you ask my about my opinon , i will tell you that nobody can be fourcied to follow one way , but as i say before , that i feel that the bes way is the second one .becouse it will give you s confidous first , in your self and than you will be able to anser any qustion that anyboy wll askes you .also your teachers will be so happy about your level .i hope all peoplt
