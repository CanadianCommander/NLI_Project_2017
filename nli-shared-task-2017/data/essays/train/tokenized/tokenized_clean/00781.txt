companies spend a considerable amount of money in marketing of their products .the principal aim of these marketing campaigns is to increase sales of their products .a secondary desired effect is to strengthen the image of the company and of the product .consumer choices are often based on brand prestige .in view of these goals , it goes without saying that companies regularly try to make their products as attractive as possible .to name just a few recent examples , we may think about airbus 380 , sony laptops and amd processors .airbus presented their new airplane in a very glamerous way , highlighting the exceptional comfort , high speed and low fuel consumption .recently we learnt that they knew about many major problems , in particular the wiring problem .of course they did nt mention such problems in advertising spots nor will they ever do .they had to admit the problems because they were unable to deliver the aircrafts in time .moreover for the stock market they have to provide some information regularly to their share holders .but even then they did not really tell the truth .another example is sony .they are producers of power supply for laptops .they recently found out that batteries may explode causing damages to objects and injuries to persons which are close to such notebooks .even if they now offer to exchange all the batteries , it do not expect them to mention this in tv advertisement spots .the story of amd is somewhat different , because their product is working as you may reasonably expect from the tv spots .the newest processors are much faster and cheaper than the ones of previous generations .so where is the flaw in this case ?the flaw is somewhat more subtle : they once compared their products with the ones of their strongest competitor and showed their superiority in terms of processing power and power consumption .meanwhile in recent advertisements they do not mention that intel has now the better processors .so they deliberately omitted that their products are now inferior in many aspects .their are many more examples of the style `` by my product and you will be successfull  .what successfull is depends on the product , but many times one can spot admiration or other positive feadback from friends and envy from competitors .consequently these examples give evidence that companies are unwilling to disclose their weaknesses in advertisement .
