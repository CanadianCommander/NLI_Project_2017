i agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really arethe advertisements are made for help the sells of the products that they are showing .the advertisements are made by proffesional people whom has been studying the way to transform a simple like in a necesity .they have had created ways to produce and reflect the best caracteristics of the products , and of course do not show or let think about something can be wrong or is not really good , for make the people feel a necesity for more products than they need .for many years the advertisements has been created with specific information , colors , pictures . ..everythig is put and combinated having as a result a machine maker of necesities based on likes , desires and hopes .the advertisements are showed by many ways , from the most common and popular television , till the most sofisticate internet and movil phone .they have to be around and close to the public that they are made for .this can be done by schedules .for example if the product is for babys and kids the advertisements will have place on television by the time the school time ends every day .also they can be in the supermarket in very big spaces , with flourescent color , music , and some times with the characteres from the kids  favorites cartoons .by other hand when the product is for the big guy in home , like dad , the advertisements will be showed on weekends or some times during the weekdays late at night .the advertisements have a good razon for exist , when they make what are they made for .some advertisements try to sell , other give infomation or can be asking for help .you can see some others that may seem like have nothing to do , but this is because they are made for no one of the grups that you can be on , but they still been doing a specific work , look next to you , it may be working with your family members .there is not way for say that i do nt believe that most of advertisements help products seem much better than they are in real .this works , and it works good .
