there is a controversial issue about whether students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject .depending on their distinct backgrounds and experiences , different students hold different opinions .in my point of view , i think a specific learning is better because it is more dominated in a person s career .the most impornt reason of choosing a specialized knowledge is that nowadays the knowledge in every subject is becoming more and more difficult .on one side , as the sciense and technology develops , the knowledge of one specific subject becomes more complicated .on the other side , a person s energy is limits by the nature .thus , if a person insists on learn a broad range of subjuects , he will find that he is left behind the other persons more and more .for example , one of my classmates , who liked to learn lots of different subjects , such as mathematics , biology and arts , got a bad gpa during his college career .therefore , we should not expect us to be a perfect person who knows everything .a good example , bill gates , the richest man in the world , may lose the match to a pupil in playing ping-pong .so becoming a person who is expert in one area is more reasonable .another important reason is that the current society need more and more specific-trained persons , such as it enigeers , doctors , professional player and so on .today works can no more be classified to several types , they are elaborated to very specific jobs .for example , the computer companies have been divided to sofeware companies such as microsoft , hardware companies such as intel .moreover , new types of companies are also appearing , such as internet companies , goole .these different jobs need more and more knowledge in specified area and a narrower knowledge range compared to the past .thus a specific-trained person is obviously more suitable than a widely-trained person .to be fair , i must own up to the importance of the elementary knowledge in a wide range .everyone should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects in his/her junior and senior school to detemine what he/she is suitable for .however , this broading learning is just preparing for the later deeper specialized learning which is longer and more important in one s career .to sum up , due to the reasons mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that students should specialize in one specific subject .
