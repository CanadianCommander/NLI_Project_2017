presently , so many people hold opionion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experiense , life style and emotional evention .however some peole do nt .they hold opinopn that sucessful people would try news things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .and each opinion has its advantages and disadvantages .from ma personal pespective , i would prefer the second opinion .first of all , doing what they already know how to do well is more safe do get suceed , however , it may also make you lose something that may even more important .since it is a world of changing , everything is changing in every minute , if you are only do what you already konw at your times , you may fall behind the times .so its disadvantages are even bigger than its advantages .the most vantial benefit of my opinion is that trying nes things and taking risks may lead you get more experience in the changing worlding , you may never lose any information .and that is what the first opinion would never achive .what s more the advanges of the my opinion is bigger than its diaadvantages .so many people would think there are too many risks during trying new things and it may lead you lose more .however , the more risks you get , the bigger suseed you recieve and that is the different between successful people and nomal people .but sucessful people are not those taking risks blindly , they would think several times they should do it or not until it is possible for them to do it .after understanding , the reasoning above , it is quite safe now to say ,
