celebrated historian , arnold toynbee , said that for civilizations to flourish the ` creative minority  needs to solve the problems faced by the civilization .if they are successful in doing so , the civilization continues or else it disintegrates .a problem is now being faced by our society , that of energy crisis and environmental pollution .our enrgy resources are depleting and are environmental problems like global warming are increasing .i firmly beleive that a solution to this problem needs to be found for our world to progress .and the solution is : lessening energy consumption where ever possible .that is why i agree with the statement : ` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .countries have already set out on the path to reducing the number of cars on roads and promoting mass transit .this has a lot of benifits .less traffic , lesser pollution , faster trasnportation , etc .day by day people are awakening to the realisation that something needs to be done about the current situation of our transportation .legislations have also come in place in some countries , for example the extra tax that is levied on cars in singapore almost eliminates the option of buying cars for some people and so they have to resort to means of mass transportation .in some countries you are encouraged to ` car-pool  , which is nothing but sharing your car with your colleagues or people who have to reach the same place as you have to .so there is definitely and trend that is emerging here , that of reducing the number of cars on roads .and as i see it almost every part of the world is working to achieve the benefits that are afforded by implementing strategies that reduce the number of cars on road and keep the people happy .that is why i believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
