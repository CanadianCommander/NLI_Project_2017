probably in the past there was a much greater sense of community than we have nowadays .everyone , since ancient times , had to do his or her part to help the community .childhood did not last for long , soon people had to learn to work and fight , and get married .what is changed now ?the time we spend to actually become `` adults  is much longer , leading to a new stage of life , in which we are no more children , but not yet mature .young people , during these years have to understand what they want for their life in order to be helpful for others .not an easy task , but young people still do give time to helping their communities , in different ways .in the first place , young people depend on their family for a long time from many points of view .so their resources are limited .the range of possible helping actvities is often reduced to volunteering .and there are people who do that .many of my friends have been volunteers for at least one year .i was part of several groups , and now i support some associations , like unicef , for what i can .another problem is that nowadays you can contribute to your community by working .this is something hard to do while young people are studing .i have just one part time job with children , because i do not have much time left from university .but i give my contribution anyways .many students do .by helping themselves , they help society .finally , it is not easy to give a definition of `` community  today .in the age of globalism , communities tend to be more virtual than physical .that is really common among young people .we create and join communities on the world wide web , almost a second life sometimes .do we care less about our community ?i do not think so .instead there might be a more serious problem : young people feel like they do not belong to these communties anymore .and people should think about why this happens .we do spend time for our community , just in a new personal way .
