after baby is born he/she growes up in many developmental stages .if he/she adapted a new skills and knowledges in each stages he/she can develop the independency , self-esteem and maturity .in the same reason i strongly believe that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .when people learn how to communicate with their close family members for their needs they start to build up their independency .they are capable of being educated for the new things such as how to talk , how to use toilet or how to socialize with others .they have to face everyday challenges and pick up the new skills and informations to grow up .these experience give them independency to live their own in the future .as children grow up successfully in ecah stage of life they develope self-esteem which need to continue to respond to changes .when they have strong self-esteem they will deal with the difficult situations better and more efficiently then who have lack of self-esteem .with all these successful experiences in growing chileren became an adult with maturity .successful people remaine having this maturity in their life and practice it in different times specially challenging time .doing something famillier make us feel safe and secuer .but if people do not take risks to learn or creating something new there s no development in human history .
