i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .since young people are making our society these days , in my opinion , the society is made good for young people .there are many places in which young peple enjoy and older people can not .for example , game center is the place where we can play many games .many young people go to there and enjoy games .however it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people .also , i think that young people have chance to communicate with people more .young people go to schools and meet friends .they also can join many activities out of the school .older people may join some activities but there are not many activities for older people .in my experience , i went to the usa last year as an exchange student nad i met alot of people who i could not see if i was in japan .if i were older , i am sure that i could not go to america and have great experiences .in addition , older people have physical problems .it is hard for older people to go to many palaces and enjoy all of them .however young people have more enagy so they do not get tired easily .therefor i think that young people enjoy life more than older people .
