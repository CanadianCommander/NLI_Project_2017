the various educational systems all over the world permit students to specialize more or less late .that leads to a tricky issue : is it better to specialize early in the studies or later ?i disagree with people who think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize .it is true that it is necessary to have knowledge in several topics before specializing .for instance , children have to learn about geography , history , biology , maths . ..this permits tu realize what we like to study and what we would like to do to work .but , i am convinced that in order to be efficient in the work , we have to know specific things in one specific area .for instance , i made an internship in a hospital last year in the area of finance .so as to understand the reasons why some medicines have been bought more that year , i had to ask to nurseries .the latter knew the use of these medicines .but on the contrary i knew about budget and accountancy .so , as it is impossible to learn about everything , we have tu specialize in one field .and , in the company , working with the cooperation of the other members of the staff is necessary to work with efficiency .nevertheless , specializing in one subject do nor prevent us from being interested in other subjects .but it is uneccessary to have a high level of knowledge in these fields , it can be just for leisure .besides , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects contains a risk .as a matter of fact , i tend to think that it prevents us from having a high level of knowledge in all these areas .consequently , we would be less good at our work .so , i bare in mind that it is better to specialize in one subject rather than in many subjects .
