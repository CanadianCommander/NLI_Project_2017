i would definitely agree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .there are some reasons why i believe so , and the examples i can give for this topic .one of the examples is that the every products at the supermarkets , especially the food look very good which makes the customers want to buy them .some products are as good as how the advertisements look when you open the product at home , but some are completely different than how the advertisements look .i am one of the customers that buys food .i look at the advertisement first and then if i think the product seems good , i pay for them .i have been very disappointed many times by being treated by the advertisement .i ve had many food that tastes completely different than how the advertisement looks like .it happens alot in frozen food .even though you look in the box what the inside product looks like , you ca nt tell how it tastes like until you heat it .people always look at the advertisement first and then decide weather they want to buy it or not .it may look very different when the frozen product is heated than how it is suppose to look like which shows on the advertisement .even though the companies that make those products make the advertisement look much better than they really are which does not really make people happy , it is not their fault .i believe that the companies work hard on the advertisements than they do on making products .the companies just want to sell products as more as possible .they know that it is the most important thing to make the advertisement neat which makes the people want to buy them .i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to sell more and more because selling products and making money from it is their job .
