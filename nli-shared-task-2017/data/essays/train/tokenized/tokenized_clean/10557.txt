in my opinion the assertion that young people should give more time to helping their communities is right but i also want to point the reasons out why there are fewer teenagers or even young adults making less contribution to their communities nowadays .the claim that young people should take care for their communities is certainly right but there are so many reasons these days that make it much more difficult .people have their own problems nowadays .especially young people always face the threatining of unemployment .the labour market today is very difficult so when students finish school they are frightened of getting unemployed what makes it difficult for them to additionally care for the interests of other people .furthermore nowadays the connection to your community is not as big as it was fifty years ago .my grandmother went to the chirch every sunday and she knew nearly everybody in her community .everything was more personal .today many people do not even know their neighbours so there is a lack of interest in helping other people and many people just care about their own .some people may also think that charity does not get appreciated in an appropriate way .i must totally agree with that opinion because i just helped in the church doing some work in the garden and there was not even anybody who told me thank you for it .this are all reasons to exemplify why i would disagree with a claim of more help from young people in their communities .even though i think that especially elder people and the government should make an effort to help getting young people envolved in their community again .if children , teenagers and young adults would identify with their community , get a feedback of their contribution and see that they can change things and in this way can make a contribution to the community i think they would certainly think different about charity work or even just helping an older woman crossing the street or carrying her heavy bags .
