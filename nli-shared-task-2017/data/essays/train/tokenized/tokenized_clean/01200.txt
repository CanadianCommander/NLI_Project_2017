do you agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?for my personality and fondness , i agree that yonug people spend too less time on concerning their communicaties .in addition , i will argue over the belife in the following reasons .first of all , i think that young people spend too much time on their studing and playing .for example , most of students go to library for researching informations after calss .in addition , many students go to play baseball and suffer the internet in their free time .moreover , some young people prefer do other execise to help their communications .furthermore , young people think that it is waste time for helping communicaties .in a word , few young people willing to helping their communicatiies .secondly , young people think that it is not necessary to help their communicatuies .for example , many young people spend many on buying their toys instead of helping others .in addition , most of young people think that communicaties is not their best friends or relates , so they do not willing help them .moreover , the soical structure has a great change nowdays , few young people has also change thier concept about how to help others .furthermore , young people has misleading concept that they do have responbilities to help others .in short , many young people do not give enough time on thier communications .in summary , i think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communicaties because they do not realize that helping other is an essential vituer and value for human .in the end , i will conclude my argument by emphasizing that young people do not understand that the enjoyness and happiness from helping our communities .
