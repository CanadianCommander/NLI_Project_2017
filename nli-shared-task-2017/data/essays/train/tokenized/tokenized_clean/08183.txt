as consumers live in the society of advertisements , they see abundant of commercial advertisements .and they often face the situation when the quality of the products does not meet their expectation made by the advertisements , because it is natural that the advertisements make products look much better that they really are .it is a given characteristic of the commercial advertisements to maximize the positive sides of the products and to minimize or even hide the negative sides of the products .and this process will alter the impression of the consumers toward the products .for example , the advertisements of fastfood restaurants such as mcdonald s or burgerking , do not mention about their nutrition facts .not because they do not know about it , but because they know it will harm the image of their food products .they mostly try to show how delicious the burgers are .and without getting all the bad informations about the products , consumers , of course , think the products are much better than they actually are .also , the media take influential role in this process .there are limitations for consumers to analyze the products .it is extremely difficult to evaluate the products in short period of time while advertisements are on the media , and also because they are indirect way to show the products , consumers just can not get correct impressions of the products from the advertisements .and surely , it leads to the misleading of the impression about the products , usually to exaggerated ways .psychological factors of the advertisements are also worth to discuss .as consumers look at the advertisement of the body spray `` tag  , they get the notion that anybody who sprays the `` tag  will attract numerous beautiful females .by showing that one who uses `` tag  can attract numerous females in the advertisements , the company tries to give consumers an impression that `` tag  is attractive , and effective body spray .although there is nt too much of a difference between `` tag  and other body sprays , this advertisement make consumers to think that `` tag  is better than other body sprays .so , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
