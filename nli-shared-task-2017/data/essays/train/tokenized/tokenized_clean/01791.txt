there is a famous aphorism that says `` jack of all trades but master of none  .i agree with this saying and hence donot think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .instead , one should specialize in a single subject .firstly , in today s dog-eat-dog world , it is important for a person to get ahead in the rat race .specializing in a single subject helps an individual to have exclusive knowledge of that subject and hence he will secure more lucrative offers in the field of employment .the demand increases and the supply being less , the individual is rewarded amply for his spcialization .also , there is an abundance of academic topics to choose from and very little time to pay total attention to them .gaining knowledge about many subjects is simply impractical .secondly , if a person concentrates on myriad subjects at the same time , unless he is an exceptionally brilliant individual , there are chances of his getting overwhelmed with the sheer diversity in the subjects that he has to deal with .for instance , it is a widely known fact that leonardo da vinci was a true genius and had mastered various fields ranging from science to art , which is evident in his works ; from model aircrafts , to bridges , to the `` vetruvian man  , to `` mona lisa  .this goes to show that unless an individual is confident about his capabilities , that is he can deal with a vast number of subjects like da vinci did , he should not bite off more than he can chew .also , from the scientific view point , the average human brain can process only a limited amount of information at a time and that too about a certain number of topics .though it is proven that we use only 10 % of our brain capacity , why not focus the remaining 90 % on a single subject and master it ?dealing with too many topics at one time could lead to confusion and chaos and could result in frustration for the individual .moreover , if a person has specialized knowledge about a particular subject , he can work in collaboration with specialists from other fields , hence enabling him to socialize as he simultaneously distributes his knowlede to others .in this process he also gains knowledge of other fields .finally , i think that a person should have a basic awareness and not a thorough knowledge of as many subjects as he possibly can .in this day and age , specialization is the key to a successful academic , professional and social life .
