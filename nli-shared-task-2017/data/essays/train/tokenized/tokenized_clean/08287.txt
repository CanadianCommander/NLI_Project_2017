i agree with this statement .because i think there is so many cars in this world .so there is many problems occured because of that .if people see this writing there are gets angry because they are use car everyday .car is necessary item for human now .but do you think that really car is necessary item ?no .it destroy the nature and also cause lot s of biologic problem .and also there are so many car accident .i do nt know well about car .but i know it cause lot s of problems .now i m live in osaka in japan .lot s of people using bycicle to go where .also many cars there .i think ride a bycicle is a good idea to protect nature .and also i feel if cars get increase , people have to make a road or roadway for car run .so they cut the trees or digging mountains , and so on .if cars wo nt be decrease , there is no nature .so i agree with ` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ..
