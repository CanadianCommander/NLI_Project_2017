the present generation of young people grew up in an increasing affluent world .because of this , many people have the impression that young people nowadays are spoiled and selfish .however , i think this is an unfaired opinion .amittedly , there are spoiled breds among young people , but most of them are willing , and even eager , to spending time to help their communities .firstly , the vibrancy of local and international community-involvment programs ( cips ) proves that young people nowadays are willing to help their communities .for example , in many schools , the response for short-term or even long-term cips is often so overwhelming that selection proess is necessary .also , many students are willing to get out of their comfort zone to help out in villages where living conditions are extremely poor .this shows their willingness to spend their time to help more .secondly , many students are commited to various programs over a very long period of time .for example , some students in singpore continue to be a member of the interact club from secondary school to junior college , over six years .they typically take part in different programs , for example , giving out tuitions or helping our at an old folks  home , twice a week .again , these students show that young people are willing to sacrifice a large amout of time for their communities .thirdly , many young people have the intention to be social workers , or at least volunteers .those who have participated in cips or other volunteery work find such activities enrich their experiences .while they help the weak groups in their communities , they gain satsifaction of helping others .as a result , they want to do more and even condier social worker as a career choice .a social worker at her twenties i know had the aspiration of being a social worker after she started in a program for ophans .she felt strongly to commit more time after graduating from university .thus , young people do give time to help their communities .in conclusion , the young are not as selfish as many people think .as they benefit from society , they want to give back , too .they have the passion to help their communities and are willing to commit themselves for community-involvement programs .
