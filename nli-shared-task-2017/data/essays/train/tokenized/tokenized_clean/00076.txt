in life we see and fall down in al lot situations that show us that the world is moving and changing .this is because of people that can feel when is the moment to do or to try to do something new and unknown .there are nt a lot of corageous people but we can see and we have to admit that these people exist and improve our society taking risk .if they had nt been existed , we probably would nt have had what we have right now so , i think that a good example might be leonardo davinci .he lived a long time ago and he was considered a mad man with a lot of strange ideas .nowadays we have the possibility of using his ideas and to adfirm that he was and he continues to be a genious .he continues to be a genious because we are already following his knowledge to do usefull and important things , but when he was alive he took a lot of risks because all that he wanted to do , all that he said , all that he wrote was new and considered by normal people strange , crazy or even stupid .another example might be dante alighieri .he is the father of the italian language and he started to write in italian language when other people were using the old one .probably he was considered mad too , but if he had nt written the `` divina commedia  , we would nt have spoken how we are doing today .he was really corageous and tried to explore other ways to do something and to improve his work and he finally did it .he wrote one of the most important book of the italian literature .at the end of the day , to achieve the success we have to take risks and to try new things .in my opinion , we could nt and must nt continue to use and do what we already know how to do well and we have to follow the examples of our masters .
