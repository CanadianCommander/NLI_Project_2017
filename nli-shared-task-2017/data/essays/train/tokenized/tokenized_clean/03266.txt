i am agree with the idea that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today for differents reasons .first , people are more concerned about the pollution on the environement than years ago , and they see as problem that we have with the higer temperatures since few years ago .some people made the decission to use the car only for a specific and relevants situations .they use the public transport to go to work , they discoverd that with bus or metro they arrive faster , and they above the trafic in many cities .second , health on sociaty it is every day more important .many people use a diferents ways to try to be feet on their daily week .it is became more popular use the bike as personal transport .in many european cities as dublin , barcelona , paris . ..goverments ate concerned and the are preparing the streets for people who use the bike .also it is a good idea for have less pollution on the cities and trafic more fluent .other people prefer to walk or runn when they go to work and they dont have to use the car , they keep feet without of cost .it is a big descision when you decide to buy a car .they are very nice and handy bthey are very expensive thing to have .cost a lot money the insurance and petrol , it is other reason for why i think in twenty years we will have less cars on the streets .
