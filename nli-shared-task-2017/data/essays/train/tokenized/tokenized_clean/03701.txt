i definately agree with the statement that the traveling in group by a guide is the best , even though some people think they would like to make a trip individually .there are two reasons for this : cost of the travel and the chance of making friends .firstly , i would like to point out that the cost of the group travelling is lower that that of private travelling .in many famous sightseeing places , there are discounting systems .for example , the fee to see a famous garden in kanazawa , japan is 1000 yen for individual visitors but is 300 yen for group visitors .furthermore , the rent of the sightseeing bus is extremely inexpensive .in general , the rental cost is set cheaper for the group travellers .if a traveller is going to take a bus or train , he or she has to pay more money to move to the other places .the second reason is that we have many chances of making good friends during the group travelling .in the bus or train , a tour guide is generally explain the history and the viewpoint of the next visiting place .the member of the group can listen to the explanation and discuss what they would like to see .this conversation will help people to make friends .during my group trip to kyoto , i talked to many ladies and discuss the history of the city .they listened carefully and want to know more about it .after the trip , i married one of them .moreover , we will have a chance to sharing the experience of the travel .we can exchange the e-mail address to others to send pictures .for all reasons , a group travelling is the best .
