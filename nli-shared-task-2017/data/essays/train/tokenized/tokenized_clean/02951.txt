definitly , people who is successful take their life in continuos challenge .sometimes , someone ask why he / or she can get everything that he/or she wants and i ca nt .in my opinion , the answer is very simple .it is neccessary work very hard for get my goals .people successful have three esential characteristics that the frustrated people not .the first is take risk all the time , second they are confident in themself and the last they are positive .first , people successful said yes for almost everything to do ! .for example , i was working in a project in the laboratory of pathology , but a partner to my field inviting to work in a different project .i worked with him without though in the inconvenients to result .when i accepted , i meant to studied harder and long hours to compensate my deficiencies in something new .however , i did and we finished the project and published it .secondly , usually these people are confident in themself .they do nt feel scare to begin something .in fact , they always are in continuing challenge and never think in fail .they know very well their limits and capabilities .in addition , these charachteristic let them to work in best advantages than the rest of people .for instance , i followed the trayectory to famous basketball player .he knew his capability and deffects better than anyone , so he worked specifically in his deffects until he improved .as result , he was the best basketball player to the year .this point is relevant for being successful , if i know my limitations .i need to work harder all the time with it .third , being positive is giving to me an excellent capacity to learning useful things for my goals .in other words , i can get fails , but i take it , such experience for try again .in short , i agree with the statement people successful have to be confident , positive and be anger to take risk always .
