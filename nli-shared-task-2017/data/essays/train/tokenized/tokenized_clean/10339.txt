`` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are todaywhile reading the statement saying `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  , each person can have their own opinion .personally i disagree with that statement .i will show my point of view in his essay .after witnessing the huge evolution of transportation and communication , we are nowadays very much concerned about the environemental problems that are caused by this evolution .however , people ca nt stop using transportation methods though it destroys the environement .for the past twenty years , we have seen that the number of cars in use is increasing .in fact nowadays it has become an essential part of our lives .twenty years ago , each family had a car , whereas nowadays each member of the family has his own car , which did nt only increse the environemantal probems but we are also facing a huge number of car accidents which , most of the time can lead to death .on another hand , cars are being used nowadays to travel .many people think that cars are saffer than airplanes .and sometimes cars could be used to take big or heavy things when airplanes ca nt handle the weight .people today are very attached to their cars .in fact , people can personalise their cars , by the color , the car model , the seats . ..it became part of our identity .people are more and more attached to their cars , and that s why i do nt see how in twenty years there could be fewer cars in use than there are today .i personally disagree with this statement because i think that cars became part of our lives .if we come to think about it , we all use the car on a daily basis , at least once a day . .the only way to have fewer cars in use in the next twent years is having an evention that would replace the car , which ca nt really be made in a short period of twenty years .
