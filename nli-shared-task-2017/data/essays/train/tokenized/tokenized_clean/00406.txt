since i lack of experiences in young people participation in other countries , let me focus the topic geographically .in colombia , young people involving into their communities is quite common .but , it is specially clear to see in low classes people .this phenomena is not present in high classes youngs , as it is in low classes youngs .my opinion is , i think the youngs who participate helping their community and contributing to its development are people who see that in their community something is missing and the think , they feel , they can do something in order to improve some life conditions .for instance , a boy who likes playing football goes every weekend to the field .once he sees it without grass , it can be that he encourages other people playing with him to do something for improve this situation .then , they can collect some money from neighbors and buy the grass and fix a date to plant the grass and this way the may have a better field .on the other hand , high class young people are not in touch with problems , because most of the times they are already solved by their parents .so they do not feel the need to fix something because everything around them is fixed .besides , their priorities lie on studies , parties and some other aspects of life that do not include their communities .also , somehow their good economical situation makes them more individual , losing in some way the communitiy sense .taking the same example like above , a rich boy goes playing football in the social club , where his parents have some share .this club will have for sure an excellent field with recently cutted , soft grass .so this boy will not worry about grass .he probably will worry about wether he will use the sauna or not , and if he will go to the pool with their colleagues after the game .the situation illustrated is a common example of everyday life and a different way to see it depending on the observer .for people who likes to participate , community sense is very important .people who do not , simply do not mind .
