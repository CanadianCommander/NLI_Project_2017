how a travel depends on the travel guide .in these day , most of people enjoys travelling other place using packed tour .in such travel there are a tour guide who explain how the travel is valuable and what is to be seen , or what is to be taken a photo .in my case , i made some plan that contain where to go , and what to see , by myself , because it is less expensive and have more free choices to alter the plan .in such self planned travel , there are some unwanted problems .they needs too much preparation and research before going the travel .travelling by packed tour makes you more easily and have lots of fun to meet and make some friends while travelling .and there are no need for difficulties of planning , and reduce prestudy for the travel .also there are some other benefits .if there are smart travel guide , who knows the hidden danger and can make adequete caution to the group .and there are lots of fun to talking with group and the guide .sometime there are risks for travelling unknown place by oneself , so i think the most important thing is not travelling alone , but travelling with group .mostly the photos which are taken with the smart or beautiful guide become one of the beautiful memory of the travel .
