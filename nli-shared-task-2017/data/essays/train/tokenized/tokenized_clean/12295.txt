although students in the same class take same courses under identical circumstances in terms of instructor , teaching aids and experience , and assigned textbooks , two groups of students may arise after that course .during and after the course , some students will focus on understanding ideas and concepts , while others will be content of accepting absolute facts undoubtly .i belong to the first type of students , and hence i strongly agree with the statement .when you take a course , whether it is at university or school , with intention in your mind to just receive passively new facts then to ga back home , then allow me to tell you that you are missing the point !students who want the instructor to merely plug in data and information into their brains in class , with no deep and profound interest in the topic , are on their way to become dummy as machines .they will never raise relevant questions in lectures nor participate actively in any class discussion .this , in effect , will lead them to the what so-called cramming .exam crammers may enjoy good results , in some situations , for a while , but they will regret it in the soon future .i believe that learning is about understanding new material , questioning results and facts , knowing how things work or why they are the way they are , then moving to your own conclusions and evaluation .on the other hand , if your purpose of taking any course is to comprehend it to the most , then you are on the right track .students who dive into this deeper level of understanding will excell , not only in academic life , but also in the professional one .thorough examination of the topic you are studying will get you beyond mathematical equations , if you are studying technology , or beyond clusters of words and paragraphs if you deal with literature .information will make much more sense to your mind , and you will feel the real power of knowledge when you study in order to understand , not just to pass the next exam .in conclusion , understanding the underlying concepts and definitions behind any learning topic is more solid and lasting than going through facts quickly .the benefits are promising and will become more evident in the students future .
