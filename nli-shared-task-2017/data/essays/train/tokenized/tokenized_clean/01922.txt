the issue at hand is that the youngsters of the present age do nt devote enough time for helping their communities .this issue is of significant importance because it questions our ability to carry forward our ancient traditions to the younger generations .i personally agree with the above argument .there are many reasons for which i agree to the statement .first , the youngsters nowadays hardly get time to spend in helping their communities .this is mainly because they are most of the time involved in academics or even over burdened by them .they have hardly any time to help their communities , let alone relax .they are overburdened with assignments and tests in their courses most of the time .being an undergraduate , i hardly find any time for other activities due to my busy academic schedule .secondly , the youngsters today are less inclined towards the propogation of their community culture .this is mainly because of the various factors , the main reason being the lack of interest on part of the parents .it is the parents  duty to instill the feeling of belongingness towards their own community and culture .this can be attributed to the fact that the parents are also occupied with their works and hardly find time to spend with their children .the parents should also encourage children to participate in cultural events .however , the parents rarely show interest in such issues .another reason for this could be that the interactions and regular meetings between communities have declined gradually .this can be attributed to the increased amount of migration of people to distant urban places in search of greener pastures .the long distance also provides hindrance to the regular meetings of the communities .after my family migrated to the city , we could not find time to regularly meet our relatives since the city was far away from our village .in conclusion , i feel that all the above factors have eventually led to the lack of time for the youngsters in helping their communities
