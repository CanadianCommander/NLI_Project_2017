i agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .having knowledge in a broad number of academic subject not only constitues an all rounded person , but also paves the way for the success in specializing in one specific subject .to acquire a truly thorough understanding of a specific subject , the knowledge of that subject alone is not enough .it is in conjuction with other subjects that gives academics a greater understanding of what they are currently dealing with .if one only focuses one s studies in a specific subject , their method of thought would only be limited to that particular subject .for example , a mathematician might only be familiar with the methological deduction of a problem , and hence be unable to understand matters with an imaginative mind .should the mathematician develop his mind in different ways , say through art or writing , he might be able to develop mathematics further .for example , the klein s bottle , named ( not suprisingly ) after klein is a mathematical concept which is not applicable in the real world .yet it has been and still is an important mathematical concept and puzzle which forms the bases of further mathematical investigation .if mathematicians follow a logical and structural line of thought , the klein s bottle would have never been thought of and mathematics would not be able to further itself .furthermore , take philosophy for example , it has become apparent that to become a successful philosopher , one must acquire skills from various subjects .kant and heidegger amongst other prominent philosophers have had their say on the subject .they believe in order to become a successful philosopher , one must acquire skills from mathematics and science , an ability or a means to comprehend the world , a method of logical mental training that is crucial to the functioning of a clear-minded philosopher .given the proliferation of academic institutions that faciliate research and learning in all sorts of areas , each discipline is slowly beginning to exhaust itself in its subject matters .also , the technological advancements have lead us to be living in an ever changing environment , resulting in many new inter-disciplinary connections .for example , even the development of a robot dog takes into account the psychological effects it will have on humans , and creates a more acceptable model .( hence the connection between the engineering and psychology ) .with the above two reasons , it is even more crucial that in order to truly succeed at ` specializing  in one subject , not only does on need to delve into the contents of it , but also in other academic subjects .in conclusion , even if a person wants to specialize in a specific subject or be an all rounded person , it is crucial to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
