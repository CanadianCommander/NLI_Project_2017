in general i agree that most advertisements let people think that products are better as they are in reality .there are three different types of publicity that makes its products better as they are .the first group of advertisement is the one that simply lies about the qualities of a certain product .it says that products are able to do things that are not true to make the product seem better .a product is better the more things it can do .today often it is not enough if people can use a certain machine just to do one thing .because people need many things today and they do not have a lack of space ( and often also a lack of money ) to buy for everything a new machine .so today a mobile phone need to have a camera , a radio , a alarm clock and many things more in addition to a telephone .so often today companies use lies to make the product seem better as it is .the consequence of this is that the customers are disapointed and do not buy products of this company anymore and do not recomment this firms to their friends .so the company often is not able to survive a long time .there is a second type of publicity .many companies exagerate when they discribe their product .one way for exageration is to make the advertised thing seem nicer on a picture or at television as it is in reality .many technical products look after a short time of use very old .in the advertisement a shaver looks very new although the man in the publicity say that he is using it already for a long time , a year or so .or often products look bigger or packagings give the impression that they are fuller as they are in reality .the consequences of those advertisements are not so grave .people are used to the fact that advertisements exagerate and ofthen people do not complain because of those details if they like the product in general .those exagerations are not essential .the third group of publicity are also lies but this group differs from the second group mentioned above .those lies are lies that people do not believe .a company sometimes says impossible things about a product just to make it famous and to let the people think about it .a very famous example is a drink that is called red bull .the advertisemet says that if somebody drinks red bull he is supposed to get wings and to fly .but everybody knows that today it is not possible ( or not yet ) to drink something and then be able to fly .so that is a lye ( it can be called also a white lie ) that nobody believes .it can be also seen as a strong exaggeration that does not harm anybody .finally it think that most companies make products seem muck better in the advertisements as they really are .but today companies often do not have another possibility as to do so .because there are so many advertisements and people just look at the ones which seem interesting and innovative to them .so there is a big battle of the best advertisement .
