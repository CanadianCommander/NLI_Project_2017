i believe that it is always better to do such things than just read or look at .i definately disagree with it is more important for students to know the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .i feel this way because , just to learn the concepts students might lose their attention or interests , and to learn facts is very effective .first , students often prefer to do some activities than be in the class , which means that if they learn only the concepts and ideas will lead them to not concentrate on .for instance , in the computer class , most students do not really want to know how the system operates , why it is , and so on .it make them to lose interesting .on the other hand , if they go on to the computer and look how it operates for real and use computers , it get much more attention and interests to the computer class .second , to learn the facts is much more efficient to most people .education is always like to know what kind of educate can be more effectiveness on it .the answer for this is doing `` real  things .let s think about the brain .in what way do you remember things better ?read the passage , learning all the concepts , or do something with using all your five senses and exprience ?i believe that experiecne helps you to remember meterial much better .here is a good example of that .before i came to canada , i did kno nothing about computers .since i had to use computer to get done my homework and to chat with friends back in korea , it made me to be so familiar with computers .now i can even fix up and tune up the computer .if i only read books about computer and tried to unerstand concept i could never be that good at it .as the conclusion , understanding concepts might lose people s interests , and do real thing is much more effective than other stuff , it is more important for students to learn facts than understand ideas and concepts .we have to realize what is always better in what ways and try to bring them in the real world .by having mroe activities and experienced will make education to be a lot successful .
