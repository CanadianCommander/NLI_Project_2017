i have had always a lot of discussions with my teachers about the statement whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i found it always not neccessary to learn so much details about a certain idea or concept while my teachers on the other side often thought it is very important .here are some reasons why i think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .the first point is that in my opinion it does nt prove that you have understood the whole system when you just have to write down some key words in an exam as you have to do it when you just have to learn facts .when you have to write down in an essay how a concept or idea works it is a real prove for the student and for the teacher that the student is able to connect things properly .therefore learning whole ideas or concepts is more effective for both sides , the teachers and the students .in addition i think it is more interesting to learn a whole idea and not only facts and statements on this idea because during learning this idea you will as well try to understand how this idea was build up .by trying to understand this your head is able to learn this more easy because there is a connection from this point on .to summarize , since it is not this boring to learn an idea than it is to learn facts without any connection , the student will be able to learn faster .an other reason why i prefer learning ideas is that i can use them in the daily life .with this knowledge for example i can understand things better .for instance the earth quakes which occur in california because of the san andreas fault from time to time .if i would have just learned that there are earthquakes and not the reasons and the concept why , i would nt have been able to understand the things they explained in the news last week about a little earthqhuake there .so i think that learning concepts or ideas improves my general knowledge .all in all i came to the conclusion when discussing this topic with my teachers that the solution lays somewhere in between .since there are sometimes students who have understood the concept but ca nt give an example how they can use this concept in life .this is an experience a teacher a teacher have had .that s why you should have to understand the concept and fill this concept in a second step with facts .
