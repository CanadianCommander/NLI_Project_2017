i agree with the statement .in many years , since cars were created and got on sale , people have used them and had them in their lives as their legs to go where they want to go .and cars are also contribute to carry stuffs faster and easier , not just people .today , cars are needed by world and peoples lives as i wrote .but you know what cars need to move .that is gass .people also have used much gass along with cars since they started to ride cars .but it led oils that creates gass to be used up from underground of the earth faster .if people did nt touch , it would nt happen .but spending or wasting of gass is still going on now .so , wasting of oils caused using up of them .that is about why countries that have oils is making the oil ( gass ) prices higher and higher .then , who need more cars that uses gass even more than now in the future ?looking at the plobrem , scientists are trying to find or create new kind of fuels to move the cars for gass .for example , there is an interestion way to get new fuels .they are finding the way out to get fuels form suger .when suger gets heated up , it makes a kind of alcohole .and that can be used for cars only if they are mixed with gass .now , suger alcoholes ca nt be new fuel being used by itself , but scientists believe that they will finally sucssed making them completed and people will be able to start using them to ride their cars .actually , this work is going well now by the scientists .and that s why i said people wo nt need any more cars moved by gass .that can be said that it is not so far people start riding cars with new fuels , i consider .otherwise , people wo nt be able to have their lives like right now with cars .from the reasons i wrote avobe , i agree with the idea in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
