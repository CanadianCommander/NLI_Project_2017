`` new things  make you excited and `` take risk  does not scare you at all .there many successful people around the world , what is common between them is that they tried new things and took risks .i strongly agree with that statement with following reasons : new things does not need to be compared and bothered by competitors .looking through inventions around the wourld .nothing existed before it had invented .so you would not imagen and think what it looks like or how it works before someone announce a new things .inventor is always using their imaginations to make new product .it comes not only their mind but also people s demands .although they feel worry until thier investment is achieved form people , they feel excite to make new things .once it has appeared in public , there is no comparable thing in the market .so that it is easy to get great reputation from public .i had worked at coordination company in japan , this company was found for coordinate japanese tv and commercial company or production to film in africa .when we established this company , people said `` nobody want to go to africa and public are not interested in africa at all  .during the first year was hard time for us .but from the second year , we gradually got customer who goes to africa .more and more take tv people to africa , more and more publics are interested in africa .as a result , we had a big african festival in tokyo collaborate with many african embassies and japanese key tv stations .since our company is the only one in japan , we can constantly get a work and never bother about competetors .although we had to make difficult dicision and take risks to try new things .it produce benefits of uncomparerable and no competitors .
