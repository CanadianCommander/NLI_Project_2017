i aqgree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i think that i m not alone in this matter .it happens almost every day .we are bombarding in so many ways with so many atractive products advertisements , that appeals our senses and pockets that it s almost impossible to resist .in one occasion , an andvertisement called my attention in a magazinne ; the picture , specifications , value and over everthing the total garantee of complete satisfaction or the money will be refunded no questions abou it , cought me up .i bought the product and i got it , of course , it was nt the the way they pictured it literally .i m thanked and glad , that there are laws which protect consummers from this type of commercialization ; that s why the manufactures knows that not every body will be pleased to have their product and they give us the option to return it .with this previous experince , i think before to buy .i preffer to see , touch and evaluate the product before to buy it .i ca nt say that always is like this , of course there are products that supports what they proclaim , but i think that there are not to many
