in my opinion , being an specialist in specific subject is much more important than having a broad knowledge .that s because modern society wants specialist .at the previous time , such as 19 century , slight and broad information about all range of academic subject would make out efficient solution and perspective view of the problem .but the world has changed .we can get that kind of knowledge in internet , very easily .it s not wealth anymore .so , having a normal knowledge about all over the academic subject can not makes you a needed person .when you were teenager , school ( or teacher ) teaches you all kind of subject such as english , mathmatics , biology , art , etc .but when you get in to university , you have to choose your major and study deeply in that parts .why the education programme is changed general things to specific thing ?university makes a leader not a just normal citizen .when you roll as a leader , you need a specialized knowledge about your major .the society goes to diversity , they need an specialist on several parts to solve complexe probleme .so the importance of specialist is emphrased .if you want to be a needed person , you have to study your own subject , and be specialist .that way will make you wealth people .
