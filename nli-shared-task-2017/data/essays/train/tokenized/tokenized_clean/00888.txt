i totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .let me start it by supporting myself with a saying -  winners dont do different things , they do things differently  .history gives ample examples of people who chose a different pathway for them altogether to achieve succes in what they believed .taking risks comes in way of trying out at new things .of course people are worried because of unseen worries by selecting a path less travelled .quoting names of few people hailing from different regions of society and from different disciplines but successful in there deeds - mahatma gandhi , elbert einstein , wright brothers , henry ford , bill gates , sachin tendulkar , michael schumacher .all these people achieved success .success does not only come from a studies oriented field which is clear from the examples stated above .every one is not created with a same bent of mind , there are people wgo are strong in sports and other extra curricular activities .they perform well in those fields but only if they choose to take a risk of choosing a track different from the usual .there lies the risk but it is only psychological if they are ready to work gard towards it .who said success cant be achieved in sports ?who said freedom could not be achieved with non violence ?no one choosing to do a regular task would believe the fact that a brick layer s son ( michael schumacher ) would be a success synonym with car racing .ideas develop in thoughts and thoughts have to differ to develop new ideas , and wright brothers are perfect example for that - noone thought of flying in air but their different approach led to the gretest inventions of all time - the aeroplane .all these factors sum upto a success story .new things and ideas and taking risks only lead to development .
