there are a lot of things that a good student have to do ; indeed , i think that to study in the right way ia a very difficult thing to do .it s important for students to understand ideas and concept .it s important , in other word , to learn a lot of information about all the subjects that a student is studing .for example a math student have to know , and to learn , and in particular way , to understand very well all the rules of his subject .if i think to my personal experience , it s very important for me to study carefully , for a lot of reasons , but two are the most important .fist of all for my personal knoledge , because only studying , in my opinion , i can know a lot of different things and i can open my mind .second , only studying carefully , i can learn different and often difficult information .on the other hand , it s important to learn facts too .it s important to verify all the topic studied , in reality .it s important to do practice about all the topics that a student have studied .the math student , after have studied a rule , have to do a lot of exercises about it to understand it , and at the same time it s important to know what mathematics have done in their life , for example what they had studied .it s important to read newspaper and to have information from the reality .an economy student have to know how business are going now in the world , and have nt only study economy from books .in conclusion i disagree with the statement because i think that both of these concepts are important .if you study something and do nt do practice on the same topic or you have no notice about facts , you ca nt undertand in the right way this topic .in the same way if you know facts , but you have nt study before , you are nt study in the right way .
