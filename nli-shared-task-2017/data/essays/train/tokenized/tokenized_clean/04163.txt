the process of learning changes through the education of everybody .at the beginning , at kindergarden , you just learn processes and how you can manage certain tasks , like cutting out or painting a nice , cute picture .later in pre-school and junior-high you have to learn facts to get a basic knowledge in all parts , which are important in life and are of interest for your later developement .but the latest in high school , under ideal conditions , everybody should nt just learn facts and figures .just stuying numbers and notes gives you the opportunity to have an answere ready to each question but that does nt mean you are able to explain what you have studied neither can you transfer your facts and figures to other interesting fields .i totally agree with the statement , that ideas and concepts are much more important .they make you able to generalize what you know and learn interdisciplinary .an example would be , if you know about the political system of europe and can contrast it with other political systems and have really understood the concepts you can easyly judge the monedary politics of countries and why money and law can make a difference .this just by adding your knowledge of math and governmental studies with your knowledge of law .with just knowing facts about the political systems and not having understood the process , this combination and explaination would not be easy to make .besides , by not just studying facts , you will be able to adapt what you know much more easier to fields and areas you have nt heard of .i think , especially in college , this is really important .it helps you connect everything you see and learn and gives you the abillity to take part in complex discussions .from my own experince , i know that this overall problem is disscussed controvercial .although some people might think is makes more sense , having all the facts about a topic ready , i prefer being able to explain everything in my own words , because i have understood what i am talking about .this usually goes to show if somebody asks me to explain something he has nt understood .if i ca nt put it in my own words , me too , do nt really have a clue of what i have studied .of course , it takes a lot more time and passion to read about a topic , but you can say you got the whole idea behind it and i strongly believe it s worth it .by doing so , i also keept that knowledge for a much longer time than the knowledge i have from learning facts .this means that i usually ferget those after taking the test i have learned them for .versus the understanding i have from figuring out a topic by trying to get the ideas and concepts behind it .this topic i usually keep for a long long time .all in all , the decision to just learn facts or the whole concept has to be made by every individual because it is also a matter of learning habits .i have decided and a rather study ideas than facts .
