since students start learning thing in the schools , they have the responsbeality to learn everything they should know ; therefore , students are suppose to understand ideas and concepts more than just knowing the facy .there are some reasons why i think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the fact .first of all , students that understanding ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interesting in that subject .for example , once studnets understand the ideas of how math work , they can do the math easier and faster than others who do nt understand the idea .also , if students knows what the concept is in a history event , they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it .they can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is .secondly , i do nt believe students would learn well if they just learn the facts .for instance , many subjects like history , geoeraphey and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts .if students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to good marks on the subjects .further more , if students do not learn the subjexts well , they can easily fail the courses and lost their interests to them either in the history , math , science , and even english calsses .based on the two reasons that i mentioned above , i suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does lot more important than only know the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects .
