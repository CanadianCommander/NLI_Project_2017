i would rather agree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .why ?because sometimes some fields are complimentary .you ca nt study a science field or an economic subject without knowing what is next to it .let s take an exemple : molecular biology .to be a molecular biologist you have to deal with interactions of molecules within the cell , so you do have to know about the cell .also you have to know about physics to be able to interact with the cell without breaking the cell wall or to harm the organites within the cell .then also you have to know a bit of chemestry to know at least how the molecules you are working with might interact with some others particles .and molecular biology might work along with medical fields too , specially cancerology and treating genetics diseases .also , i think that in everyday life you ca nt just talk about one field .to me having a conversation implies that you have knowledge about someting more than the area you work in .it means also an exchange of opinons , and if you keep on saying the same stuff to everyone , you would soon be out of speech .you would bore people .and also who might talk to you ?your work collegues might not want to discuss of work after work .nor would your friends if you keep on saying the same things .nevertheless knowing about several fields does not mean you kave to know everything about each field .you just can not , you will keep being a specialist in your own field but having a knowledge about other domains , not necesserely related to yours , for exemple you can know italian and work as an acountant .so you would be given better job opportunities , and probably allowed to go to italy .you have to exceed expectations , and k
