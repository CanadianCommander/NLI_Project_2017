although it is important to have thorough knowledge of a specific subject , it is essential to have a general wisdom of diverse academic themes .the world is becoming more competitive every day and we are demanded to have a greater range of abilities .examples such as globalization and socialization are important to illustrate this point .thanks to technology , the world is becoming unified .the relationship between countries s economies is increasing exponentially .because of this we find now that many companies are working globally and have established headquarters in several parts of the worlds .for this reason , we are now forced to learn at least two or three languages in order to successfully relate with consumers from other places .if a person is good at selling a certain product , his skills would be useless if he could not communicate properly with a buyer that did not speak his language .this example shows the importance of having at least some knowledge concerning other academic subjects , in this case languages .not only in our work life is it important to have general knowledge but also in our private : when we go to a party or a reunion , we like to socialize with a lot of people .because of this , all sorts of topics of conversation are discussed .the conversation can be about any academic area as long as it is in the interest of the speakers .if a person wants to join a conversation about biology , for example , he has to know something about the subject , otherwise he will be forced to listen and will be reluctant to participate .if we have a general knowledge about several themes , then we speak our minds without any doubt and therefore , we will enjoy the party more .it is clear that by being familiar with diverse subjects or themes , we will make our life much easier .not only is it important when it comes to work , but general knowledge can be applied to something as common as a reunion .a person that is cultured always creates a good impression no matter what is the ocassion .
