i completely agree with the statement .although i can not be one hundred percent positive about this fact i think there is a clear trend towards reducing the use of cars in our society .i must admit that i completely support it there are several reasons that support my opinion .first , there is an evident increasing trend in terms of transport diversification that has a direct impac in the reduction of the use of the car .tube , aeroplanes , urban buses , fast trains . ..are new ways of transport addressable to the public that did nt exist before .when my parents were young going from madrid to barcelona on a plane was unbelievable as there were just one flight during the day and they were extremely expensive .nowadays , with the drop in prices of flight tickets , nearly everybody can afford it .the same happened with the tube .in the past , just a few cities had tube systems whereas currently , most cities have underground or are planning to open it or increase the number of lines second , governments from most countries and the european union institutions are continuously encouraging the public transport and the fewer use of cars .in my opinion , this is considerably reasonable taking into account the pollution that cars generate , the congestions and the high number of cars accident .for example , in some cities as london , frankfurt , rome , etc . ..to access to the city centre , citizens have to pay a certain amount of money , which clearly show the government willingness to reduce the number of cars third , as new communication systems develop ( internet , mobile phones . .. )the need to actually move from one place to another ( let s say for a meeting ) reduces and the need to use cars reduces as well for all the reasons explained above i think that there would be fewer use cars in use in the future .big car manufacturers as toyota , ford or mercedes . ..will have to struggle in the future in order to achive good economic performance .i am pretty sure that they will try to encourage the car sale offering attractive discounts etc . ..but i do not think that they will be able to stop what it s already an increasing tremd
