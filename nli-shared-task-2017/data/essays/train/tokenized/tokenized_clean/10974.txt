i think travel in a group led bay a tour guide is the best way the tour guide is a good assitance of tourists .because , during the trip the places are strange to those visitor they do not have any ideal about the place they are in .everytime when people go on a trip in the new area , always get the tour guide .the tour guide konws the detail of the area where they in .it mainly include : the induction of the area you are travelling , the map of the area , the landmark of famous scence of view , even the hospital , police station , hotel , and so on .follow the tour guide , the tourists can do a quiete perfect travel plane , find out the most beautiful or most desirable place easily , chose the fastest traffic to get there , these or saves time and money .and the places chosen by the tour guide are all valuable , which are the places the visitor must go .if the tourists without the guide they may miss the good view or funny case .and when the tourists traveled in group it easier to organize some funny activities .like a party near the beach .the more people the more happy atmosphere .during the trip the tourists can make friend with each other , even a starting of love .it is kind of good communication between people especially for those people in the city , buzy with their work all day .but something sad is that recently , the tour guide becomes a commercial pormotion gradually .like , the guide cheat the visitor with the local shop onwer , this kind of issue always happened .sometimes the tour guide s oppinion may not suitable .because everyone has their own taste , the place chosen by the tour guide the tourist may not like .and with in a group it has limitied freedom everyone must act follow the schdule , when the tourist travelling on one , he do not need care others , just go to everywhere he want .though it has some short , it still a good chose for tourists
