with in today s busy and hard life many people suffer their life instead of enjoying it in my country becouse of economical and other kinds of problems but i think i am the one of the luckiest who can enjoy a part of it .i do nt see the issue as an age matter but i take it as the ability or opportunuty to enjoy the life .although it s meaning chances person to person , enjoying life means being happy , loving someone and marry with her , having a healty baby and going to a concert or a movie for me .and i recon these things are all about money at the begining and human effect comes next .i mean if you do nt have enough money to do these things then you may not experience their pleasure so you ca nt be satisfied .another point is the human effect which relates the issue most and it means wish or want of a person to be happy in his or her life .for example if you have money and wish to go to outside for a dinner , then it is so simple for you to do this .otherwise if you have money but no wish or vice verse then you can not have a good night so i think lifestyle does not depent on age .in adition to these two major points , i must state that your social enviroment has also good or bad effects on your life .for example you may live in a place where there is no movie therefore you can not go to a movie even if you have maney and wish .in summary , i live my life as much as i can enjoy it and this depends on my opportunties but so many people may not take a lot of it s good points in my country and i belive that enjoying life is all about your wish and ability to do so .
