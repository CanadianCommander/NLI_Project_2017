progress we enjoy today can be attributed to some scholars .those individuals who understood the basic concept and ideas of their respective fields and thrived to develop them .there , however , is an imposing question of which is important for students whether to learn the basic ideas and concepts or mere facts .as a buildings strength is determined by its foundation basic idea and concept are sufficient enough for us to learn the facts .students should be taught the importance of these basics as much of the facts we know today are drawn by logical reasoning .many philosopher stress over this idea .facts which do not provide us with the understanding of how it works are merely of any use .for example , if a student doesnot know how an electrical engine is started and what principle involves in its working but knows the mere fact of its uses there is no point in his learning .moreover , with the rapid improvement in todays world it is the basic ideas and concepts that are followed rather than facts .for example , consider system application process ( sap ) which is revised and updated every time so that it keeps it competetors abay .if the programmer knows only facts on which command leads to which result then he wil face problem in the upgraded version but if he knows the concept on which procedure the compliler works then he can also use the upgraded version though with some difficulty in the beginning .finally , it is through these , ideas and concepts , that the student will , perhaps , draw inferences on how some of the basic things work and work innovative ways rahter than thinking like a stereotype .thus it is teach the students the concepts and ideas rather than mere facts which is not advisable .
