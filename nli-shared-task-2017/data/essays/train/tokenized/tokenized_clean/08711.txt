i agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .certainly , there are many reasons to discourage people from using and owning cars .the first reason is pollution .cars burn fossil fuels which give out lots of greenhouse gases and other pollutants .as people become more aware of the environment , more and more people are against the idea of using cars now and in the future .the second reason discouaging the usage of cars is the depletion of resources .the number of years we will be running out of petroleum is calculated and it is shortened again and again due to rising demand .the price of oil skyrockets in recent years , and so does the price of gasoline .suvs are no longer favoured by the consumers and more and more people gave up driving their cars totally or reduce their usage of cars due to higher oil price .as the number of cars on road increases steadily , road conjestion and parking space have become serious problems in many countries , especially in fast developing countries like china and india .it is quite normal for a driver in shanghai to take two hours to complete a twenty minutes drive in conjestion .finding a vacant parking place can take up to half an hour in the central part of shanghai .unsurprisingly that many drivers get frustrated and give up private driving .however , solutions to the problems of the current cars have been implemented and some of them are working .hybrid cars invented by toyota are selling fast , because the hybrid car saves energy and use less gasoline .but the problem of depletion of oil is not directly addressed here as the electricity needed to charge the hybrid cars is generated mainly using oil .oil price will still increase and discourage people to drive cars .
