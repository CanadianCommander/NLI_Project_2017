nature , the greatest creator in this universe , and the most powerful force of god to exersice his powers on earth has allowed millions of species to flourish on this planet .homo sapiens , now so called the rulers of this planet , do have a lot of dissimilarity among its own kind .these dissimilar groups form communitites .the biggest responsibility of a man born in a community during the ancient or medival ages was to work for the development of his community and try to show its superiority to others .but with the advent of modern technologies and the world shrinking into a global village , the social structure and thinking of man changed .now he is no more confined to a particular region or to a particular community .he moves out explores the whole world and tries to interact with other communities in the form of adapting their culture and even having marriage alliances .the offsprings thus are not much attached to the communities of their parents but they have a stronger penchant to carry on the voyage of exploring and intermingling with other communites , which their ancistors started .but the biggest community , a man belongs is mankind .and contributing to its causes has been and will always be the biggest responsibility of each and every homo sapien dwelling on earth .the race of earning more material resources has left today s youth with less time to fulfill its own responsibility towards its community .its displays shear lack of courage and determination on the part of the youth .profession excellence to an individual means much more then investing his time and resources to attain communal excellence .this is indeed not the only face of the coin .we can always observe a lot of social service being offered to the needy and to some weaker communties .the youth surely is not showing personal contribution for the causes of his community but they are indeed contributing as organisations .many organisations inspired by experienced personal have encouraged the youth for communal activities .so , it is apparent that prefession involvement has surely shown the way to the youth to contribute to their community .yet , if few youngsters are not willing to take out time to serve the community , then they do not deserve the right to survive in the big communtiy called mankind .
