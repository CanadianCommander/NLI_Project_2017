the above statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do  it is not right .i disagree with this statement .many of the old people enjoy with thier life than youngers .in the oldage the people have leave all the burdens and they are spending their own interested work .infact younger have more responsibilities and work in that age , sometimes they ca nt enjoy because they dont want to loose their official work .forexample , long toor we want to go , in that time spending fifteen days of time for that , that is not sufficiant for all the youngers .some of them are missing for thier own impertent things but old people are spending maximum time to that toor .not only toors but also in daily things .moreover , old people enjoy with childrens and playing with them .they can act like a child like playing criket , chess etc. they can enjoy thier own way .old people work in their young age and then taking the rest in this old age with their interesting activities and abilities .i conclude that , older people also enjoy .enjoyable things and ways are different but they can also enjoy .not young people enjoy life more than older people .young people and old people can enjoy themselves in thier own ways , styles and adjustments .
