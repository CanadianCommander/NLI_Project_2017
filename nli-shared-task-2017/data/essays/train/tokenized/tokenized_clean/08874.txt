it is not easy saying whether an advertisement makes a product seem better than it actually is or not , since at first sight , few of us could really be able to find any possible difference between what is proposed to us on television and what it is .anyway i will try to answer the question and to give you some examples in order to have it clearer .in my point of view , it could be possible that most of advertisements try to mislead the final consumer .this is due mainly to a few reasons , such as the strong impact of television on the audience and the increasing commercial interests which play a key role in nowadays society .the former motivation , could be easily demonstrated taking into consideration ads regarding toys or anything aimed to children and younger groups , which are the most vulnerable attendance .it might be enough launching some new products through advertisement during the cartoon time in order to convince children to buy it , being aware that a children is not able to know whether that ad faithfully reproduce the desired toy .the other reason , could be referred to a wide range of other items , which can be related to house keeping , cars , insurances and so on .as a matter of fact the commercial aim hiden in about most of activities , push producers to use as many means as possible in order to reach a huge number of customers .this can be achieved by companies using a strategy such as showing a product in a way which could be believable but not totally true , taking advantage of weakness both of the weakness of people and of the strong of television .in conclusion , even if there is no certainty about this topic and even if i tried to set it out just from a television angle , without taking into consideration newspapers , i say that i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than reality .
