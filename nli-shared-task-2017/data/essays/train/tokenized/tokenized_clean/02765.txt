the art of making advertisements is one of the most important things to sell a product nowdays .people of this century is really involve in the advances of tecnology ; so , instead of reading a book , most of us are watching television or navegating by internet .this tecnologies , and also the street , is full of advertisements and we ca nt avoid seen or listenining them .as i said before , we are all the time in touch with advertisements and i think that this way of salling a product is the one that gives more benefits to a company .thats why i agree that companies do their best to announce their products in the andvertisements better than they are .for example , you can see and advertisement of a shampoo that sais that it would `` leave your hair very straight and soft  as the model that they show .as a fact , you can be sure that the moldel did nt only use the shampoo to look beautiful , but the company needs to reflect how people wants to look like and they will use other products to get the best impression on the audience .we have to be very careful with advertisements because as i said , in most of the casses they are not showing the truth .most of the time are a strategy of marketing of the product and , if we are clear about it , we wo nt get dissapointed when the product do nt have the quality that the advertisement shows .
