in my view the success depends on the area where he is working t. so , i belive `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already they know how to do well  is true in some cases and it is not better in some other cases .firstly , taking a sports man in to concideration he should adopt some new methods to improve his skills in his game rather than trying for some other games .so here the sports man is suggested to carry his carrier in the same field without going to other fields and taking risks .on the other hand , let us see how the success comes from the new things .for example , white brothers invented aeroplane as it is new to the world they were praised by the world .and later several people have made some improvements to that and those people who made improvements to aeroplane are not so much praised as the white brothers .this is because the basic and the idea is given by the white brithers and the others just have made some modifications .those people who have made some improvement also may get fame but not to the extant the white brothers got .the people those who follow the procedure given by others may not get succed as much as the people who give the basic idea .we should note that going for new things give succes but it may or may not be changing the field of intrest .in software field they need to change their domain frequently to give their best outputs .so here they need to try for new things and take risks .they need to change from one domain to other very frequently .in conclusion , the things give success if it is new and it dosnt matter it is his new area or not .so , in some cases improving their field is prefered and in some cases goin for new things is prefered
