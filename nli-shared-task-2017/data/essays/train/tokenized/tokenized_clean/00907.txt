this statement is quite extreme .of course there s people meant to be inventors like edison or da vinci .but those great persons were living in another time .the last century have witnessed a large part of the most brilliant inventions that can be made .now we re living in a reproduction era .as we can create we upgrade things from the past centuries in order to give them an other utility or aspect .make it thinner , stronger , more attractive or affordable but not revolutionnary .for instance , cinema was nt invented by one person .it was a hundred year of effort which gave it its actual shape , which , i think , is far from being the final one .in its first year people find it absurd and reserved to sideshows but daring director made it a real art .from da vinci s  camera oscura  to lumiere s cinematographe there s a whole world of experimentation .we need this kind of daring person .how can we know that an object have reached its final shape ?how can we put frontiers to creation ?thirty years ago , it seems unbelievable to imagine having a phone call outside .now it s essential , people ca nt live without cell phone .that s the evolution process of creation which is a permanent process .it s not given to anyone to succeed in making new things .it required courage but also lots of imagination and self-confidence .it s a huge work on yourself and who you ( think you ) are .inventing reliable things occurred once in a lifetime but upgrading is possible .we need both kind of people to go on evolving .some are meant to invent , so to upgrade of transform but both are important for our mankind .men ca nt live without creating of he s giving up the greatest quality he had been given , the quality of dreaming of something else and make this dream come true .
