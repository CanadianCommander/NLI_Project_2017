i do nt think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by three reasons .cars are expanded too much to cut off from our lives .as many people know , cars are very convinient and usefull machine .in japan you can get a drivers lisence for no reasons except if your are older than 18 .many people has a dream to drive a car especially if you are a male .so it is impossible to say that you can not use a car for daily life .in a several years , i think cars wo nt use a gasoline than now .it is true that cars are not good for environment .but many car companys are triing to make a new type of a car .for example , hybride car .in the future , there may be a car that moves only by a electricities and not by gasoline .this can prevent a green-house effect .so there will be any reasons for not useing a car .if you do nt use a car for transport , there should be a alternative transportation .not useing a car means you have to use a different transportation to go somewhere .in japan trains are very common , but it is not so common to use a trains in other countries as in japan .for instante , america .these are my opnion for the statement .
