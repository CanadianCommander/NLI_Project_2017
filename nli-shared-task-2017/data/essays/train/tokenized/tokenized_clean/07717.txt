what should one focus on , facts or ideas ?that question remains one of the trickyest issues of pedagogy .some tend to put forwards facts , others ideas and one s ability to understand and explain ideas .the problem is not only pedagogical , it is also philosophical .both of them facts and ideas are pretty useful to one s education , yet should one deserve more graces than the other ?facts are necessary to the comprehension of any matter .how could one get the idea of the roman empire was without any facts ?accordingly , knowledge transmission should not leave facts aside for its appreciation a reality .an assertion few historians could contradict .however too many facts tend to be disturbing .the expert who always focuses on the same facts allows himself one single reality .his comprehension of the situation can not be innovative and his behaviour will remain static .facts lead to exception .on the other hand , understanding ideas , can help one understand issues he might not be familiar with .understanding the dynamics of the fall of the roman empire can help one explaining another situation .ideas have a got a plasticity that facts do nt have .but the notion of idea itself remains quite blur .for a philosopher , ideas and concepts are facts .in that letter heidegger uses this concept whereas in this lectures he did nt .why ?he asks .that same professor while having spent too much time in the pool of ideas has made it a tank full of facts .one has to be cautious with ideas as well .moreover , ideas tend to lead us to abstraction .even though abstraction is attractive , it can end up on dramatic mistakes .the commitment of several french intellectuals along with communism testifies of it .students should therefore be as keen on facts as they should be on ideas .one does not prevail on the other .they should be intertwined .
