i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .not many young people are seen in community activities , and it seems like their interest is not at their local .three reasons can be thought of when thinking about this issue .firstly , young people seem to be busy with their own life , and has less interest in their own communities .this is because their everyday life is basically at the achool or university .there , they study on subjects they have interest in , and they may also be participating in a circle or an after school activitiy .it can be guessed that young people spend more time there , instead of helping out at local communities .secondly , the community itself is not systematically organized for young people to participate .the problem of japanese society now is that the local communities are not working out in many places because people have less contact with their neighbors .for example , in big cities with people living in high building appartments , it is normal for people to not know most of the people who live there .you might see some people once in a while , but in a busy life , there is rarely a chance to really get together to form a community .therefore , young people do not spend time to help out in their communities .lastly , the local communities are mainly run by older people , such as people who have retired jobs and have more time .these people gather and organize community activities and spread it to neighbors .for example , it takes time to organize an event in the community .you need to plan out things to do , and also go knock on doors to ask for participation .when there are not enough people , you struggle more and have to work harder .so it is natural to say that people who have more time has more chance to participate and help out in the communitiy .this might be one of the reasons that youg people spend less time in community when compared with older people .from these three points that i have stated above , i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .young people might be energetic and be a big help , but when their interest is somewhere else , it is difficult to bring back their attention .
