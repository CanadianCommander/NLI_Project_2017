this essay will examine the question of whether or not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .it seems pretty obvious that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the first example that comes to mind are the pictures of food at fast food restaurants .one sees a perfectly looking hamburger in the picture , with fresh lettuce and tomatos and a enormous piece of meat , but when you actually get the hamburger you find yourself dissapointed looking at a squashed hamburguer bread with barely anything in it .we could add many more amusing examples .for instance consider all the weight-loss products .the advertisement shows a before and an after picture of the person using the product .the before picture is of a heavy ugly looking man , and the after picture is of a handsome fit man ( usually it is not even the same person ) .in fact the person who actually buys the weight-loss product will soon discover that the miracle solution to his weight problem is nothing but a sham .the simple truth is that companies have to lie a little in order to get attention for their products .it is a whole different question whether or not these exagerations or glorifications or even straight - out lies will actually help sell the product .it seems clear that consumers will stop buying a certain product that is made to look good in an advertisement if in reality it does nt work or is much worse than it appeared to be .so producers have to realize that overdoing it on the exageration will end up backfiring on them .companies must add a little truth into their advertisements in order to make their products more appealing to consumers , even if that means reducing the charm of their product .after all , the consumer will make the company suffer if the product it attempts to sell is garbage compared to the advertisement .
