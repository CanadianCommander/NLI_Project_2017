nowadays we can watch at television a great deal of advertisements for a lot of products .consequently , we can wonder whether the products we see at television are really good or not .i totally disagree with advertisements because they turn people to be stupid .most people buy products only because they have seen them at television and think that they are good .most of time the products are not really so good .for example , there are a lot of advertisements for food whereas everybody knows that these products are very bad for one s health .that is why i think that advertisement is really a con and is here only to attract naive people and so that businessmen might make a lot of money on those poor people .moreover , in my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .western countries are living under the reign of money .money attracts money , that is capitalism and this is one of the reasons why advertisement exists .in the other hand , food scandals are more or less the consequences of advertised products .for example , i can quote the foot and mouse disease or the mad cow s disease .it can also be added that because of the bad quality of certain products , some unscrupulous people dare to send these  rubbish  to lower developped countries and it is a shame
