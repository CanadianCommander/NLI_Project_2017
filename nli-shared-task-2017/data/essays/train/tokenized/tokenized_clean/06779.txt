today you found a lot of products on the market .many firms give you a big variety .on the one hand there are different kinds of products .on the other hand , there are differences within one group of product .in the following paragraphs , i explain , why i agree with the statement , that is told .an important aspect of a product is the function , that means , whether the product could work in the way , it is bought for or not .in regarding to that , most advertisements do not underline the function ; they replace the main point with other extra facts .sometimes it is impossible to find out which product is the best or functional .to explaint it in a clear way , let us use an example .a mobil phone is a important part of modern life .if you want to use it only for phoning , than you do not need a camera .but such an additional function can confuse you .but it is important to know , that it could be differed between several countries .another main point is that products with advertisment cost sometimes more money , than similar products without the advertisment .you have to find out , if you need the advertisment .sometimes it costs less money to buy the advertisment seperat .if you want to have a personal computer , it cost less money , if you buy for example a painting programm seperate than as a part of the personal computer .as a result of those reasons i agree with the statement .i think you have to find out , what you want to have and for what use you need the product .also , a comparison between two products or more but of the same kind of product could help you to find out your personal solution .the products can be from different firms .
