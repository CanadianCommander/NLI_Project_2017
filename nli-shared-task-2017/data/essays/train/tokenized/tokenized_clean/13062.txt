i agree with the statement according to which most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .i have often made the experience of disappointment in front of a real item that i had only seen on a television screen or on a billboard .and for sure , i am not the only one to come to the conclusion that advertisement is just about misrepresentation .every day , one has the occasion to see , for example , a poster that presents the wonderful characteristics of some new beauty cream and the terrific effects it will have on the reduction of lines and dark circles .the fact is that the efficiency of such potions have never thoroughly been proved , and that their using has never prevented anyone from reading the traces of time on the face of an old woman .but nowadays , advertisement is a necessary evil in consumer societies .indeed , the goal of producers is to sell more and more every day .advertisers are hired to achieve this goal .they try to present the product so as to create a desire , even a longing for it , so that people buy it as soon as they can .they repeat the operation in order to accelerate the process , and to earn more money .advertisement , then , necessarily uses spectacular words and emphatic images to make people dream .advertisement , for some people , only sell dreams .hence the habitual disappointment when consumer face products as they really are .advertisement then is often a legal issue .the problem consists in knowing if the advertisement is mere puff and blow , or if it really corrisponds to a visaul form of contract .if such was the case , the advertiser would maybe be liable for making a fraudulent misrepresentation , and one could clame for damages .
