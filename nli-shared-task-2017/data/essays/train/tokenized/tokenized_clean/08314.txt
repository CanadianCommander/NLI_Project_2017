i agree .in this rapidly changing world with higher degree of sophisticated benefits , comforts , luxuries and entertainment , young people are not sufficiently motivated to lend a helping hand to the community in which they live in .the changing dynamics of world in terms of pace , the benefits money can bring , young people are getting attracted to them and started pursuing money earning habits or past time activities from a younger age not witnessed earlier .right from schooling a ` comprasion attitude  in terms of quality or higher rank is commendable , yet it becomes deplorable when it is described or implanted in the younger minds as a trigger to money earning activity .such an impression in the early stage lasts long and effectively works in the minds of younger generation in pursuit of that goal .another stage that younger prople fall prey to this attitude is when they are deprived of certain minimum comforts their peers are enjoying .this may make them parasites and kill or supress their natural concern or feeling for others .the wide variety of entertainment available now a days keeps away from helping the community , rather spend as per their wish to derive some pleasure .though nothing wrong in spending for one s own entertainment or comfort or benefit or luxury , being a part of society contributing to the society is like paying back to the parents .the attitude of paying back and concern for others also gives pleasure and creates a healthy atmosphere .this type of metamorphosis can be brought out by collective effort and higher degree of introspection .it becomes the bounden duty of the parents and teachers to explain the moral and social values of the system and ensure that such qulaities get inculcated gradually in younger generation .by explaining and making them understandable about the pleasures of sharing and helping the needy , younger generation can be made more responsible and acquire these divine qualities .
