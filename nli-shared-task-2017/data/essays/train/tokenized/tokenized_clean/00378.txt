i dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than old  .in the fast moving era everything in the universe is at constant change .everyone wants to learn more and more inorder to compete with the computer generation .if person has good job skills he or she is considered as intellegent .other wise they are beeing considered as mere pippets .so i feel older generation is enjoying more than young people .while i was in college i almost spent most of my week ends doing some assignments or preparing for presentations .my grand-father used to ask me to go with him for live conserts .which takes place in the other end of our street .but i never used to go .because i have to work hard inorder to get good grades .he used to talk about those shows for many days .he truely enjoyed those times .if one wants to enjoy he needs money .he has to think about many things , if he is the only one who is earning in the house .he has to devide his salary to house hold expenses , children education and also to pay taxes .but when he gets old most of the expences will be eliminated .like children education and taxes .so this is the time they will see some money in their hand .so they try to enjoy it for their own life .not only that lately many young people are suffering from lot of stress because of work load .even if they get vacation they are not able enjoy that time because of stress .which inturn leads to many more health problems like high blood pressure or diabetis in their early ages .but elderly are far away from all this work related stress as they are nolonger working .whoever have no tensions in life they enjoy the most .in my guess thet are old people .according to me elderly people in our comminity are enjoying the most than young generation .they get sufficient to go to clubs or entertainment centers to pass their time which is not possible for youngsters .
