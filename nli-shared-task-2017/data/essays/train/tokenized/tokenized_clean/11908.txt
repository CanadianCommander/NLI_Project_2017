it is often believed that successful people love to take risks and new challenges than to carry on with their regular routine .i agree with this statement and feel that success does play an improtant role in accepting challenges in life success in any field of life , helps one to think more positive and confident about his/her decision making ability .it urges one to look for something more in life .i can give an example here .when i was a kid , i wanted to learn to ride a bicycle .after many attempts and repeated falling , i finally got grips with my problem .it made me happy and i was elated at my achievement .but my urge did not stop here .now i wanted to learn riding a bike , because i felt i can take on this challege effectively .if i was not successful the first time , i might have not taken any step to learn something new .even in a professional environment , the things which u already know make it a routine rather than a challenge .what keeps any successful man/woman going on in his/her field of work is the enthusiasm to find new challenges and his ability to pursue those challenges .today there is cure for cancer .this could have been possible only because of successful solution by various researchers .there has to be a success step to climb on for future combacts .there are people like bill gates who saw potential in software , got success which enabled him to expand his creative ideas .so to some it up , being successful not only gives confidence in taking up new challenges , but also helps in exploring the creative side of a person .it gives an edge from other people there is an assurance that your idea worked in previous effort , the risk involved is conciderably less .
