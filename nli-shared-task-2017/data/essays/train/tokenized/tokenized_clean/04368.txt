first of all , we have to determine whether we are supposing to be in a high school or in a college situation .that definition makes a great difference on my opinion .in fact , if we are in the high school case , i think it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .the reason is that high school students have to primarily go over as many subjects as they can to realize which are the ones they are most interested in .second , a wide knowledge of subjects gives the students a wider view , it `` opens  their mind , and get them the opportunity to increase their culture level .however , this is not valid for senior high school students because once they reach the last school year before college , they should now focus on what they would like to study in the future .for instance , if a student wants to study advertising at the university , he should start taking art classes , or economics lessons , so that to receive an introduction , a perspective of what he will study the following years .on the other hand , talking about college situation , i disagree with the statement since i believe that , once you graduate from high school and you get prepared for the university , you should concentrate yourself on a specific subject .that does not mean , by the way , that you do not have to study other subjects .it simply mean that you have to channel your studies on the subject you will need in your future job .taking the previous example , if i want to become an art director in an advertising agency , i will not continue studying languages , maths , physical education , and the other subjects i was used to study at the high school .instead of them , i will choose subjects that directly concern with advertising , such as the history of advertising , the economic method of advertising , and other subjects that best fit whit my future job .in conclusion , i believe that having a broad , wide knowledge of many academic subjects is very important for it let us make up our minds about our future , but once realized our primarily interests , we should focus on that ones and start becoming who we want to become .
