i dissagree with the statement that `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .now in present generation the need of a car is more essential for each and every individual .the car has become an essential body to transportation .so the increasing demand among the public will lead to manifacturing the number off cars .as the population grows we need more cars , for transportation .because the public transportation in the country has failed , people need more cars for transportation , safely and in aproper time .we can also go in cars where ever we like to go , what ever time to reach .for example , my father uses a car to go to hospital .so as my mother uses to go to office .so for different reasons we use cars , if there is need for the car how can the number off cars could decrease in the next twenty years .cars now adays are used by many people to save the time , to go to job and the other places .cars are use full togo along with the family to a picknic .cars are the main public transportation in the united states , as the public transportation has failed to transport the public .therefore the number of cars are not going to decrease in the next twenty years .they are going to become the double the number off cars present today on the roads .so the government has to regulate new laws to regulate the pollution that the cars are going ti produse .
