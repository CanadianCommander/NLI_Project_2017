at the school or at the university , we often have to learn things , and we are judged upon this capacity .however i think that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .first of all , an automatic learning of events , dates , or facts , is only the proof of a good capacity to memorise . ..but to my mind it does not reveal an aptitude to solve a problem or to understand a situation .even if having a good memory is a quality , it ca nt be sufficient .then , it is clear that understanding concepts is a good way to help the students structuring their ideas .unless understanding an event , it will be very difficult to memorise it !how to understand a situation or a problem without knowing how it functions ?learning facts without understanding them would be the revelation of a lack of intelligence .moreover , the aim of the university is to prepare the students to have a job in their future life , in which they will probably need capacities of understanding and reacting in front of a situation more than pure memory .it is clear that in all works you need capacities of memory , but to understand the situation and to act in consequences is much more useful .finally , we can say that if learning facts is really the basis of the education , in my opinion it is not sufficient , and to understand what we learn is the more important .we need to know concepts and reasonments to structure our thinking .i think that the university and the school should make an effort to teach us how to think by ourselves , more than to teach us events , dates , that we will forget .
