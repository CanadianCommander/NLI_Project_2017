i am agree with this statement .because nowadays peoples has so many convinient tools and living under the good enviroments .tipically in young peoples like school ages , they do nt have to work for to living .so i think , young people nowadays and all age peoples can take enough time to helping their communities .on the other hand , i think a small part of young people dose not have or can not make enough time to helping their communities .my conclusion of above line come from the wonder of their life style .a small number of nowadays young people living in so stressful world .for example , pressure of there job norma , working skedules , etc .recentry people become phycometry disease so easily .something of our life style become strange from old time .now , i think we needs re-thing about our community and our relatively .most of us forgets our heartfull rerationships and our true meanings of life .i think we can use community relationships for our rehabilitations of emotional problems .so finally i agree again this statements with hopes for future .
