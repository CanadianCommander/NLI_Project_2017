as my opinion , learning fact is more important than understanding concepts .there are some reasons .first , the fact can make people have deep impression .everyone will have a deep impression when he meets the difficulties .as you solve the problems , you will undersdtand more about the ideas or concept you learned .solving the difficulty is also the energy for learning .you will be confident after you solve it .second , the ideas we learned in school are conceptional .they are the conclusion after experment or research .they are the base of knowledge .after school , you will have basic knowledge to face the fact you will happen in the future .although ideas are the parment elements in your study , you have to face any difficulty in your career .third , faceing difficulties and solving them will make you more completely .you have lots of experience that you will have a high position in the company .the experience will promote you to have a higher level .when i graduated from school , i found a job in bicycle industry .at the begining , i faced a lot of problems that i do nt know what to do .so , i tried to ask my coworker and found solution in the text book .after my co-workers  help , i finally solve the problems .after that , i enjoyed faceing problem no matter how tough that is .by this kind of experience , i discover that i learn a lot and more mature .that made me more satisfied about my work .the company also gave a promotion and looked forward to another improvment .
