how successful are you ?have you ever felt that you are successful enough that you do nt need to try other things and become successful in other things you did not try before .well , you are not really a successful if you think what you succeeded in is enough .successful people are those who worked hard to accomplimish and achieve their goals .as a matter of fact , you wo nt become successful unless you work hard for what you want to achieve .you can become successful if you really worked hard for what you want .successful people tend to try new things other than the ones they already succeeded in , because as successfuls , they truly believe that they have to keep working hard to achieve more goals and have various careers where they succeeded in , even if they had to pay their own risk on the trials of becoming successful in more careers .successful s ambitions do not stop at a particular point , they always have ambitions and they always want to achieve more no matter how much risk this will cause them .they believe that to success , you have to try , risk and work hard , and they work based on that theory .moreoever , if successful people tried new things and they failed , they would nt be discouraged and they would try the same thing again and again , until they succeed .it is a matter of challange .successful people always like to take challanges and achieve their goals in any case , and they do not accept failure .they might fail , but they wo nt lose hope .they keep their hopes as high as they were and try again on the same thing , until they success and become successful in another thing .all in all , i personally think that since successful people are optimistic , hard working , smart , and like challenging , they will always want to try new things and take risks rather than just convincing themselves that what they have succeeded in is enough .they would do more things than what they already know how to do well , and i believe that they will success one time even if they failed several times .
