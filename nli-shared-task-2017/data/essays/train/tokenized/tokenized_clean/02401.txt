in the past , young people used to help their parents and their communities .but nowadays it has changed .i agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities because of many reasons .helping the community is a very important thing to do but nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .firstly , nowadays young people have a lot of activities .they go the college and after that they have homeworks to do .a lot of young people have to find a job during their studies because they do nt have enough money to pay them .and after working , young people do not have anought time to do anything else .for example i am doing an european mba in a management schoolm and to pay ; y studies , i have to work all evenings and all week end .i also have to do my assignments and it s a huge work .i think that in the past young people had more time to help their community .they did nt had as many things to do as we do nowadays .i am sure that the problem is the time because young people often want to help their communities but they ca nt .to conclude the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is right .nevertheless they have many things to do and when they can , they like to be helpfull , for their communities or for their parents
