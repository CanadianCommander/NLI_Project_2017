while there may be some advantages to learing many disciplines of academic subjects , i think that it is much better to study specifi subject .there are two reasons for this : its practicality and its effectiveness .first of all , the reason why it is much more beneficial to study specified subjects rather than broader areas comes from its practicality .for example , it will be much easier to find a good job if you concentrate on studying a limited area of academic subjects .a recent survay shows that about 80 % of large firms in japan want people who have their own specialities not broader knowledge of many academic areas .in addition , it is much easiler to help other people if you focus on studying a narrow area of academic subjects .from my experience , i found it true .for example , i could contribute to a group work by using my expertise that is mass media studies .the study group that researches on the effect of the animation in japan after the second world war , needs some people whose expertise is the recent history of the animation .because my major is deeply related to the subject , i could help them .it is obvious that it is very difficult to support them without concentrating on the specific area .secondly , another reason why it is much more advantageous to learn a specific area results from its effectiveness .it is clear that it is difficult to remember all of the area that you have laerned before .according to a scientific data , your brain much more effectively memorizes a specified subject instead of a broader areas in the long run .therefore , it must be a waste of time to study a broad range of accademic areas .furthermore , it is also evident that focusing on a specific subject leads to learing a broader area of academic subjects .many great scholars such as kant , asserted that it is essential to scrutinize a specific area to understand the broader areas .i found it true form my experience , too .in conclusion , i agree with the idea that it is much more beneficial to specialize a specific subject because of its practicality and effectiveness .
