many of the companies believe that , the advertisement for the a product is crucial , vital for its presentation to the customers .and most of the customers believe the scenes created by the advertisements wil come true when they buy this particular product .considering the reasons behind these advertising activities makes me to believe that too much of advertisement about one particular item indicates that it should have at least defects to cover .addition to this , i will support my opinion based on the facts that ; the life styles that are promoted by the companies , the reliability of the information presented and the threats to the uniqueness of our lives .first of all , i am against the notion of the belief that , buying a product will change my life forever ( until the new product comes into scene ) .many of the women customers believe that , by using a particular brand of shampoo , they will have a hair like rapunzel , or the fourty-year-old women will become `` chicks  by using anti-aging facial creams .so do we have fourty-year-old women around ?with wrinkles ?subsequently , the advertisements try to sell the consumers the life style that is shown on the tv , not just the product itself .secondly , i am sure about that , the scenes we watch are not totally true .the photography of the colorful , delightful food are mostly shot at the time when the food is half cooked .also , the hair in the shampoo advertisement was first cleaned , polished and finally probably made with a sophisticated hair designer .every type of hair will look as the same as it appeared in the ad , if processed that much .consequently , advertisements are harmful for our unique lives .out traditional clothes , our grandmother medications , all . .the colors people like to wear should not be changed over seasons with fashion .do you belive that we wear the 60s clothes nowadays because of the advertisement we saw on each day , regarding the new fashion of the year ?everyone in this world will soon wear a jean in the future .it is not so diffucult to estimate what we will be wearing in the next future , just the same type of cloth .to conclude , the advertisements are harmful for our lives , in the way that the life styles that they offer , the scenes that they create and threatens the uniqueness of our lives .
