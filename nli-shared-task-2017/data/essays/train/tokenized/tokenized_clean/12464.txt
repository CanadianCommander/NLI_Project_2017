it is better to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what we know how to perfoem well .i agree with the statement and i belivetrying new things may lead to discoveries .society has developed a lot only because of the trying new things by many people .although there is a lot of risk involved in the trying new thing , but that may lead to many discoveries .when i was studying in the college , all of my team in the class discovered a new thing about an antibiotic .we tried many experiments in the lab and later we succeded and that new antibiotic got patent rights also .we faced so many risks in our work , but at last we succeded .like wise many discoveries , for ex : medicines , cell phones , internet , etc , made our lives more sofisticated and changed our way of lives in an unbelievable manner .all this discoveries have may risks involved in their work .by trying many new thing by the succesful people , they remained as a role model for the next generation .they will also involed in learning new thing from the school age onwards and they will try to imply that .weather a person may succed or failed , but trying is important .consider an example , computer was invented by charless babbage , which is very useful instrument in this century .later so many scientists developed the computer and mde that easy to every one .in this century , we can not imagine our lives with out computer .so many scients may have faced too many risks in developing a computer .they are all role models to this generation people .so now people are inventing i-pod s , lap tops , etc.trying new thing would not stopped at one stage .it is passing from one generation to the nextin ancients times , farmers tried to cultivate a variety of crops , which improved our standard of life today .now people are trying to developenew biotechnology products to improve the quality of the food .like wise trying in every field lead to the change in the society .in the conclusion , eventhough many risks may involve in trying new things , but that many lead to succesful things .i suggest every one to try some thing new , sothat the society or thenext generation people may benefit about that .that fruit-ful results may change our lives .
