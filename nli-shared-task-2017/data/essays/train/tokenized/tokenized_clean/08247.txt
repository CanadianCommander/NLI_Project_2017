i agree with the statement because i have seen this events in many oportunities .there are important differences between successful people and no successful people .first , they are alweys doing new or different things .second , they are taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .of course , there are nt only a success  method , depend of the person and his/her situation but this is important .first , the successful people is notorious because usually they are doing things news .for instances , when all the people are doing big computers , had people that are thinking about to do personals computers .steve wosniak , steve jobs and another people are doing meetings and clubs for to talk about big changes in the world with the computers .they are thinking about building and selling personal computers .they found successful companies such as apple and microsoft .so , they did things new .second , the successful people are taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .this is true .for instances , when wosniak is bigining with his emprise he must decided about his job in hp .he loved his job and he was loyal with hp but , he mus take the risk and to left his job in hp in order to found and was working in this own emprise .he take the risk .he left his job and he found his own emprise and finally he had success .
