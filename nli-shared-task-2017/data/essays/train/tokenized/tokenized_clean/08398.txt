in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in an academic study .there are several advantages of both paths , however specializing in one topic would enable us to concentrate on one subject and to deal with its details closer .the main reason behind my belief is that there is not enough time to learn everything and have a deep understanding of every subject .by the increase in the knowledge in acedemic subjects , we have to have more time to consider all spheres of one specific subject .for instance , a political science student could not have a deep understanding of the middle east culture and politics in an education period of four years .in addition to his undergraduate education , he has to have a research in middle east and should attend to a university or an institute which is specialized on middle east .actually an avarege life of a person is not sufficient to have a perfect knowledge of one specific subject .in modern societies , the division of labor demands more specialized individuals and the society is evolving into a hegemony of technocrats .beginning with the movement of rationalization in the nineteenth century and with the improvement of technology , we have more detailed subjects to deal with , contary to pre-modern times .so , there it is not only my preference to get specialized in one specific subject , but it is a necessity for the society .the details are increasing and we ought to get consistent with this development .we also need to consider that specializing in one specific subject would be meaningless , if it is so independent from the context which it is belonged to .for example , it would be meaningless to know everything about the history and the culture of the middle east , if the person would not have the enough information about the history of the whole world and the relation between civilizations .in conclusion , as a result of the development of the modern societies , people have to specialize in one specific subject .because there is not enough time to deal with many academic subjects .
