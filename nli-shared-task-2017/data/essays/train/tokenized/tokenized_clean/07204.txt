it is a must-have !who of us has not been influenced once by a photo or a spot that leaded him/her to buy a product ?i think everybody was blended once in his life and bought something that was not that good than he/she has supposed .in my opinion this is a normal trick by the marketing section of the companies letting things look better than they really are .but why do they do this ?the cause is that if you want to sell a product that you have designed or produced you want the attention of everyone for that product .it should be a must-have for the whole world .this is only possible when it is praised as a phaenomenal thing .because now the people are attracted to that and want to buy it .what could be more distinguishing than having a product that could work perfectly but noone wants to have it because it is suggested as a boring thing in an advertisment .showing products as very interresting should work better for rising your selling numbers and that is what it is all about - selling things for a higher profit .an other thing is that you must have a more specialized product that the other companies have because noone would recognize yours if it is not supposed to be the best .a problem with making produkts ` shine  is that these untruth information should not be too extreme because this leads to a bad picture of the producing company and the people that had made a wrong decision because they beliefed in the advertisement are not willing to buy future products of that company making things better is a normal way of selling but the suggested information of the advertisement should not be so far away from the truth because this will not help you in the future .
