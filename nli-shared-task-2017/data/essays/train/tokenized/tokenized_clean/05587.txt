i storongly gree the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the attractive advertisements in commercial tv , newspaper , and magazine sometime make products seem much better and attept to buy them .there are three reasons why i think so and let me explain each of them with examples .first , advertisements are pretend their real characters .macdonald is good example .their advertisement are looks tasty , less expensive , getting healthy using some vegetables .i m also lovein it .however , they use the artificial taste in the strawberry milk shake to pretend the taste .additionally they serve the food with a lot of carbonhydrate in humbergar and fried potato , and sugar in beverage , such as coke .i think no condumer knows how affect the damage for their health , especially diabate for young teenagers .second , advertisements give consumers wit additional better image for products .for example , currently , 99 % cacao chocolate is very popular for consumers in my home country , japan and looks tasty using organic pure cacao .the advertisement also indicate the taste of proximity pure cacao as the products .so , i bought the three package of them in the grocery store .however , the taste is quite bitter and hard to eat the complete one package .i feel some frustrations to the manufacturer and commercial companies which created the advertisement .third , advertisements sometime say false facts using the products .one mushroom , agarics , had been believed as effective treatmnent for cancer , stomach cancer in particular .the company also showd this is effective rather than the medicine or surgery .however , goverment shows this is not effective , sometime cause the additional diseases for patient .the president in the company said that he also believe the efficiency of the mushroom and reputation from other pharmal company .i think that the company or manufacturers are required to research the benefit of the products , even they seemed much better .in conclusion , i strongly agree the statement above .however , manufacturers need to sell the products and sometime need exaggerate phrase in the advertisement .we do not need any phrase magic in the advertisements in terms of the consumers , i hope company shold not try to deceive the consumers and just honestry to labour in the company and consumers .
