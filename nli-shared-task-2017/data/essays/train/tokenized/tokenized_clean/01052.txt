young people are different from before .in the past young people were working for own community ; however many things to have fun with friends especially in tokyo .in my opinion , i am agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i have two reasons that support my position .young people started to hang around in big city not near by their house and they ca nt think about other people .there is a city whose name is ikebukuro .this city has many arcade park , caraoke , poll barn and so on .the city is best place to hang out or date for young people .i also the one who think same way with young people think .in my ecperience , i was always haging out with friends at ikebukuro and come back home late .at that time i have never interested about my community .i was thinking that it is nt fun at all if i help my community .is there any benefit if i do so ?i couldn `` t understand people who help their community .i think there must be more people who think same way with mine .i think young people became more selfish than before .they work just for their lives , not for their family and they ca nt feel any love from family .this leads to hanging around only with friends .in my experience , i was always hanging around with friends .i could nt feel any love from my family .therefore , i could nt have any interested about my community ; however , people helped me during examination season for college .they gave me a lots of informations about college and especially my family helped me to find a college which fit my preference .i was doing this job by myself but i could feel love from my family and people who are in my community .in conclusion , young people startet to hang around only big city not to involve their community and became more selfish than before .
