when compared to the past in modern societies people are so selfish which means they are ignoring their reponsibilities for their communities such as helping .that can exactly be true when young people are considered .since they are going to be the adults of the future .why do not they give enough time to their responsibilities to the community ?it can be discussed in two different aspects .firstly , they do not have enough time to give .because they donot organize their time according to their duties for the community .they spend all their time to their professional work or entertainment .first they are giving much more their attentions to their other works especially to their professional works .for example a teenager spends most of his time in school and a young adult in his office .furthermore they spend their times also on entertainment .since entertainment issues take their attetion much more then helping their community .and entertainment makes happy them much more then helping community .secondly , they are ignoring their duties because they think that somebody can do that for them .firstly their parents does also their duties for community and they get accustomed to this situation .secondly , they think that they can not make it by their own and they are not capable of successing in their duties .to illustrate , in some social problems that require their helps , as an individual they think it is impossible to handle .on the other hand , these reasons suits their way of life .in modern societies , people live as an individual not as an community so ignoring duties for community make much sense for them .to conclude , young people are ignoring their responsibilities such as helping their community because of their not equally organized life style and their way of life .it can be inferred that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
