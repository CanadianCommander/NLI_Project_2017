learning facts makes the students to understand ideas easily .facts act as a foundation to any subject .any subject lies in the boundaries of facts .so i think that leaning facts improves the ability of a student to understand the ideas and learn the concepts .water changes its state from one form to another form i.e water is a liquid state and ice is a solid state of water and this is considered as a fact .if students are not aware with this fact how can they understand the concepts of transforming the state of water and methods used to transform .the student can not understand or develop the idea of changing the state of the water .when the foundation of the building is not laid properly then it collapes as the time passes .in the same way if the students are not perfect in the basic concepts of the theories they my face problems when they go deeper into their subject .understanding ideas and concepts come into picture if the student is perfect with their basics , those are facts .when the student want to develop new ideas or concepts they should check whether their concepts obey the facts proposed earlier in that feild .when a new concept or theory is proposed , it is accepted by the people only if it obeys the basic rules .the concept is verfied by testing it at several conditions and is checked whether the concept obeys the basic facts at all conditions .the concept is then accepted if it satisfies the conditions .facts are never misleaded but ideas have a chance to mislead or can be proved wrong at different conditions , but facts can not be changed or misleaded at any costs .facts are as true as the earth is sperical , but in ancient time a concept of earth being flat was proposed , later it proved wrong and a fact that the earth is sperical was stated .thus learning facts plays an important role in learning than understanding ideas and concepts .
