the statement that young people have a greater ability to enjoy life than older people clearly is an issue worthy of discussion .in the following essay i try to give examples supporting and opposing this fact .in the beginning of this short passage it is necessary to state what can indicate enjoying ones life .the most intuitive points are of course the amount of time spent on activities , which bring fun to an individual .examples for this can be sports , cultural activities such as theater or visiting the movie theater , social activities such as meeting with friends or visits in clubs , bars or discos .the actual amount of time spent on each activity clearly counts toward the young people .yet it should not receive much attention , since growing age comes along with growing responsibility .we shall therefore try to acknowledge the subjective feeling of fun deriving from each activity for the individual .when it comes to sports , a difference between old and young people is not clearly distinguisable without thorough research , which can not be conducted at this point .most older people lie great emphasis on sports in order to stay healthy or free their minds by physical challenge .one could argue , that young people are taking the particular sport to a higher level , but this clearly does not support the idea of a greater enjoing .every sport is enjoyable for the conducting individual , even if it is being practised at a very low level .focusing on the cultural activities , a general viewpoint is necessary .in general the age of the individual determines its taste .therefore the activities chosen are highly dependent on a individuals age .again the type of activity chosen can not determine whether one individual receives a higher reward in terms of fun from its choice , than the other individual does from the other choice .the third category stated above indicates the greatest difference between age groups .it is clearly observable and commonly known , that from a certain age onwards less emphasis is being laid upon going out a night and visiting bars , clubs or discos with friends .from a younger point of view this could be seen as a lack of fun in ones life .to conclude this paragraph the differences in behavior between old and young people are clearly visible .yet this observation is lacking evidence that young people actually enjoy life more than older people .thus this statement can not be backed by thorough reasoning .the difference in behavior do not indicate more fun in life on one or the other side .yet the positive correlation between age and responsibility could make it harder for older people to conduct fun activities .
