it is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .some people think , as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events , they can enjoy everything more than older people do .other people oppose this point .as for me , i agree to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .on the one hand , young people believe that older people can enjoy life more than they can .when i was a girl , i used to think that my parents and my grand parents are very lucky , because they did nt have homeworks , and could do whatever they want to do .i remember when i was 13 i said to my mom that i want to be 30 right now , because at this age , nothing were forbidden to me .i was so fed up to hear the adults saying `` you can not do this , you are too young  , or `` you can not stay here , we are discussing about a subject that you can not understand !!i was very upset , and thought that would be great to be older so that i can really enjoy life .however , i do not see it this way now .it seems to me that being young is synonym of being free , being independant .we can do whatever we want to without being always anxious . .is that good ?am i suppose to do this ?i really believe in the fact that , as young people are less aware of the seriousness of certain events , it is easier for them to enjoy life .moreover , since we are still young , we have everything to discover .it is great and amazing to discover some new country for example when we have the opportunity to travel , to learn different cultures from all around the world .furthermore , as we do not have children yet , we feel free to go out at night for parties , to do many things we wo nt be able to do in the future .indeed , day after day , we would certainly feel bored to do always the same things , and we would not enjoy it likely .last but not least , even if we have to study a lot , even if we have to work hard and may feel depressed time by time , i must recognise that it is even more interesting than staying at home everyday .it is more exciting to live without knowing what we will do tomorrow , than live everyday likely .on the whole , i admit that i agree with the statement , because i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do as it is the first time they had discovered everything .carpe diem
