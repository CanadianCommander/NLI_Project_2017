some people agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .while other people disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i would personally agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .first reason is keeping clean air .for example , when i was a university student , i lived in tokyo .there were a lot of car around our university .i always went to school by bus which went through big traffic .one day , i was headache and i went to hospital .in fact , duty air caused my headache .therefore , i moved to country-side , village , which has clean air .and i could get good health .it is important for me to breath fresh air .as the above example demonstrates that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .second resons is safely to grow up children .many car is very deingerus for childin conclusion , i definitely agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .
