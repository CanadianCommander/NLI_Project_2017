since this statement is not very definite it is not easy to say if i agree or disagree .what i am saying is that not all young people are the same .neither old people are .at first , i asked myself the question : who is young and who is old - how old is old , how old is young ?if you ask a teenager he will propably tell you that everybody over 25 is old and if you ask a 40 year old he will say that 60 is old .in the following part of my answer i will thing of young people beening up to 30 years and old people are all the persons beeing older than that .and there is still one big problem : not all people under 30 are the same , neither are the people over 30 .i think young people always had fun .young people go partying , they enjoy `` sex , drungs and rockn roll  , they travel the world , they play sports and enjoy their lives .young people always have done such things .my generation did , my parents generation did , my gradparents generation did my kids will probalbly do too one day .it is different with old people : in past days the people worked a lot and once they retired they died soon .they somethimes went on vacation , but that was it .today old people start to enjoy their lifes , too .since the population gets older and older there are so many old people who can spent their remaining time with nice things .some move to a nice warm place in the south , some travel and do cruses , others start going to university again .in todays time people of all ages have the chance to enjoy their lifes .there are always people who do nt know how to enjoy life , but that does nt depent on their age .in the mainstream both , young and old people , enjoy there lifes .i can not say who does more because they do it in a different way .
