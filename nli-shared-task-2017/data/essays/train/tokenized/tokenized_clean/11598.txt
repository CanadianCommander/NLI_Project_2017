i have to difine what is success or who is successful .in this essay , iwould like to define the success as people who could get a lot of money in business or who could get the fame and status .there are many people who could suceed in some particular field .i feel that most of them did new things and carried out the new planning .therefore , i agree with the statement .the first reason i agree to successful people always try to new things and take risks is because just following what people already know how to do well never leads to success .doing exact the same thing with other people doing do nt people grow up .in other words , the people who do nt grow up can not suceed in any fields .the second reason why i think successful people try new things and take risks is because most of people who do nt suceed think that they do nt want to take risks .they choose the safer way .i believe that succeeding in some field always associates with some risks like financial , time , human relationship , and so forth .if success doest associate with risks , everyone could suceed .success is not so easy task in the society .in conclusion , i strongly believe that successful people try to new things althogh there are some risks in what they try to do .fearing some risks donest lead to suceess .
