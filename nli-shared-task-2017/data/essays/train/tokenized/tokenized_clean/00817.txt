most advertisements present us great products .advertisements use scientific explanation to make us buy them .however most people do not believe it .indeed , we live in a society where speed comes first .virtual image is a perfect example .everything is made to gain time .the way of life , inflicted by society , kills the imagination .advertisements create many false declarations and we can see when we buy a product that it is completely different .it is generally always the same thing with advertisements .the more a product is shown on the television , the more it is to avoid .advertising is made to earn money , consequently the product can not be as great as it seems to be .in my opinion , the speed of images prevent us from thinking and will cause the disappearance of human qualities .
