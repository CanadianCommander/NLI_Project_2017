i agree that sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .because of sucessful people think much than other people , sucessful people do nt affread fail , and sucessful people believe that high risk would get higher return .first of all , sucessful people think much than other people .for example , people who have a lot of ideas or think what will be happen when they are doing thing before thay take action to do things will make them more easily to resolve the problems .these people are confident to face variable problems when they are action to do things , because they already predict they these problems may happen and they already think how to resolve these problems .second , sucessful people do nt affraid fail .sucessful people feel that fails are good expirence to make them far away doing these wrong ways again .they can learn fail experience from doing thing fail , and they will look for new ways to recover formor wrong ways to approach sucess .some people give up their action when they are fall in problems and dispoint or argue that no one could give then hands .thes people are afraid fail and could nt learn how to become sucess from fails .finally , sucessful people belive that high risk would get higher return .people who have above two abilities will love high risk , because the two above abilities would make them have higher properbility doing high risk thing to get higher return .they do nt do things only what they already know , and they do things in risk to get better return .
