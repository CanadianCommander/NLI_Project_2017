nowadays most students understand ideas and concepts but generally they do not know facts .i think it can become a real problem .as far as i am concerned i think that most students know ideas and concepts .indeed they are more taught in the universities .i think they are the first point in a teachers lecture .with this point students can understand facts .however i think we shuold bear in mind facts .they are important too .for instance if all presidents or rulers knew the history of the world they could avoid doing the same mistake .wars are proof of this .moreover facts are also important on economic grounds .for instance in order to make forecasts .indeed facts are always the same if we consider a long period .but after a fact we have to analyse it with concepts .on the other hand i think that students prefer learn facts .it is more interessant because it is coto conclude i think that the both are very important fot our futur .it is a question with a real stake .
