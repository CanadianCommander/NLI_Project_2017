although many people think older people can not enjoy life as much as younger , i think they can .often one thinks that old people are bored .almost everyone can talk about grandma looking out of the window the whole day watching unknown people passing the street .of course not all grandmas do that .but what about the younger ones ?is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a tv half a day and watch unknown persons discussing in a talk show .would not many consider watching tv to be amusement ?the grandma at the window might as well have fun and probably she thinks the younger ones are bored because they need to watch tv .maybe for her the man that passes by all day at 10:30 and is always in a rush means a big fascination . ..still it leaves the point that not many old persons are observerd in discos , rock concerts or in the movies .but the other way round not many young people are seen in theaters , hiking in the nature or in the cinema when the old western movie from 1950 is shown .maybe drinking a tea in a silent undisturbed atmosphere is great enjoyment for the older , while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud rock music in the background .there are of course many more examples , but those are rather dependant on the lifestyle and personal likes and dislikes people develope while getting older , than to the total amount of enjoyment they offer to differently aged groups .in my view it is a bit too general to discuss just old and young , it just does not take into account the many varieties life has to offer .each person is individually different and general views might fit for many but not for every single human being .nevertheless as discussed above i think that there are different ways of enjoying life and those are quite different , if compared to people at different ages .but ultimately the level of enjoyment people get from life does not depend on the age and is therefore equal for the old and young .
