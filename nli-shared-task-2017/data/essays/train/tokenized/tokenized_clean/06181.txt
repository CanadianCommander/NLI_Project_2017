i totally agree with the statement .i think that a student would acolmpish more with this technique of learning .this way he/she will not memorize while learning but rather understand how the person invented the theory .this ; is an effective way of learning but a teacher would not have the time for teaching every person in the class where that theory came for and what was the way of thinking .by teaching like this the teacher opens the theory in to debate and students will ask tonnes of questions .eventually there will be no left because every student will have different kinds of questions and some of them will deny the theory due to the lack of experiments and proofs .in the other hand ; writing some equations on the board and making the students memorize them will be much easier because the students ca nt question but the they wo nt any more then they are given which shuts their minds to thinking and improving the theory .at the end they forget what they have learned throughout the year because they have memorized .finally ; this way of learnig is only for the students who have the abundant resources of teachers who can argue with them and for the student who does not study only for the exam and who wants to learn for life .
