i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than tehy really are , and it is definately a requirement for company to sell its products more .the company has to introduce its products in a best way to attract customers , and to make most profits .what will you do , if you have to introduce yourself in a interview at the colleage where you want to go ?i can tell most of people introduce themselves in a best way that they can get into the colleages where they want to go .this is same as why the products are different from the advertisement .the company has to introduce its new items in a best way to attract people s eyes .did you ever go into clothes shop , which has only looking bad clothes ?because people usually think from what they see , the company put its best efforts to make its products look great .for exmaple , the advertisement of boy s toys has great backgrounds and sound effection , so when i was young i used to buy after i saw adverstisement of toys .how about the food s advertisement ?from the advertisements , everysingle food looks great , because the foods are colored with special inks , so they looks much better than they really are .as i mentioned with two examples , the advertisements make look much better the products on tv shows , and i can tell everysingle adverstisements is made up for making looks better company s item .there are many people who blame about the advertisement because of the difference between real products and products from the tv , however , we need to understand the difference .therefore , making products seem much better than how products really are ture and understandable .
