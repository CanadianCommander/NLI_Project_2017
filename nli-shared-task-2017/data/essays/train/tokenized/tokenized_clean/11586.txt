travelling can serve many purposes , ranging from pleasure and academic to businesses .a guided tour is often part of the former example of travelling ; for one s pleasure or academic purpose .the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide , however ; if i had the choice , i would rather travel alone .this is because of freedom that solo travel provides : freedom of planning your own travel , and freedom of avoiding problems caused by other group members .first , a benifit of travelling alone is that it gives you the freedom to plan your own travel .since you are the only one who ` singed up  for the tour , you are free to decide on the places you want to go to , when to go there , and what to do when you get there .as an example , when i went to hawaii last summer , i decided to go there on my own , rather than joining a group tour .because of that , i was able to see what i wanted to see ; the beaches to surf , rather than going shopping malls , which the tour focused .also , i was able to pick when i wanted to go , unlike the fixed dates indicated on those tours .by travelling alone , i was able to enjoy my stay in hawaii based on the greater magnitude of freedom i had .second , travelling alone gives you an additional degree of freedom since you are free from problems caused by others ; the possible costs i may have to incur due to actions of others .imagine a scenario where i decided to sign up for a group tour to hawaii .the schedule of which plane to take and what time the bus would come and pick me up at honolulu international has already been planned out .but it s not just my schedule ; it s the entire group s schedule .let s say that several selfish people decided to show up late .the whole tour has to suffer from the possible consequences caused by those individuals ; perhaps skiiping an activity we wanted to do or even delaying the trip entirely .it would nt make sense if the tour had to give up going to the beach because some individual was taking too long deciding on whether she should get a pink or a white coach bag .by traveling alone , i am able to avoid possible problems caused by irresponsible companions .on the statement of `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ,  i disagree in respect to the lack of freedom i would get from travelling in a group .travelling alone would allow you to plan your own trip , ( the freedom of choosing the activity and its day ) and avoid possible problems caused by accompanying tourists ( such as skipping or delaying an activity . )unless i am certain that the tour somewhat follows an agenda similar to that of mine , i would not consider traveling on a group tour led by a guide .
