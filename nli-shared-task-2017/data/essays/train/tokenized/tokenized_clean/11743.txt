i disagree with the statement , because for me is ever necessary to take some risks and try new things to have succes and not only when you know how to do well .in fact for me , if you dontt try one thing , you do nt try another things because you do nt have the experience that the precedent thing can give to you .for example , if you do nt try to use a bycicle , you do nt learn to go whit it , and after you do nt learn to use a scooter , becaus is more difficult than use a bycicle .but if you learn to go whit a bycicle , after you can use also the scooter ; so you can use both of them .the experiences that you try to do , help you for enthire your life .this is the main reason because i say that is important to take risks and try new things and new adventures .and for me also the worst experiences are important because also this experiences help you not to commit the same errors another times .in fact , for example , if you drik mich alchool befor drive , and after you make ani incident , you learn that you do nt drink any alchool befor you drive for the next time .so , in the end , to take succes , for me is important find to try the higest numbers of thing you can do
