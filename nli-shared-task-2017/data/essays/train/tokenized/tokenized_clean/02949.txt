i disagree with the statment that in twenty years will be a fewer cars in use than today .cars are important now for humanity and they will be important till we find something more effective to bring us or our goods from a to b , but that will not happen in the next twenty years .cars are also important to people because they mean freedom .with my car i am able to get to every point in the world it makes me mobile and more available to the world .in the next twenty years the population an earth will increase .more people also means there will be a bigger need for cars .people will ask for them because they are available and companys are going to satisfy this needs in matter to make profit .they statment could be formed by the fact that our fossile resources are getting less but i am sure mankind will find a solution for this problem .companys already started to test optional resources instead of the tradional ones .if our fossile resources are empty we will just switch to another one so that is not a point why there should be less cars in twenty years .another fact why i think we will not see less cars in the twenty years is the reason we need cars .we need them to bring goods to the destination we need them .our hunger for resources like water and food will increase in twenty years because we gonna be more people on this planet .since we live in cities and not on farms anymore this resources need to come to us .we have to transport them from there origion to there destination .cars are the best solution for this problem because the are the cheapest solution to solve this problem so far and i am sure that will not change in the next twenty years .i disagree with the statment there will be fewer cars in twenty years because we need cars to satisfy our need on resources on the fastest and profitablest way we can .also i am sure we wound see less cars because we dont wanna give them up cars give us the feeling of being free and people do not want to lose this feeling .
