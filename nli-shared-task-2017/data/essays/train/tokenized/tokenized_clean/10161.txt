i support this opinion that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .to learn one special subject sometime might lead to bright future , for example in terms of invention in science .if someone who do nt devote oneself into one special subject , most of amazing invention was not created .but in general we need to have broad knowledge .one reason is focuing on one particular subject makes predjudes , and such kind of person can not make flat decision in proper manner .i ve learn a lot of things thoroughout learning for example moral study , world history , asian history , japanese history , math , chemistry , physics , art , art history , japanese civil low , internatioal low or what ever .to learn broadly is important to realize `` truth  between broad range of knoledge .this is just a very simple example , but we can learn tons of things from the world history , for example , but if we do nt have any hi-leveled background in literature , we can not understand the way of thinking that we see on the text book of history .also , from leaning moral study and biology , somebody can find out heart of affection .to learn many things would be very good opportunity to find our own tarent out .needless to say , if everybody can find out their own talent without seeng many things , but it is not realistic .some scientists found out their talent or their way to live in the future , but it is too rare case .in general we human being should know a lot of things to reach their own principal .this is not only for personal issue , but also for all people in the world .so i agree this opinion .
