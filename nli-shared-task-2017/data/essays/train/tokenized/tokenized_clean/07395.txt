i do nt think young people enjoy life more than older people do .usually , when we think to younger people , we imagine them in their life cycle span of adolescence and early maturity .in this period of life most of them do nt work , they are economically maintend by family and they study at school and university .being a student offer the chance to know a lot of people , make new friends and increase possibilities to find a partner ; so young people have a lot of social interactions .with all this mates they explore the world and live new experiences almost every day , for example their first tour at night without the presence of parents , the first party with both male and females , the first love , new strong emotions and feelings ; their moods vary continually and make their life full of excitment .looks that youth is best part of life but , personally i think it is nt so for two reasons .the first because youth is also the most turbulent period of the entire life .all the biological changes make the adolescent so insicure and from a psychological point of view he is so fragile .young people do nt only enjoy parties and free time but they also suffer a lot .frustrations , delusions , psychological complex lead the young to experiment a lot of pain .the other reason i think youth is nt the most funny period of life is because every part of life can be funny , every period is important and has its specifical beauty , even senility .this statement could sound too much rethorical at a first glance but i think it s true .older people have other possibilitie of entertainment that youngers do nt have .for example having a job and being retribuited can bring mature people to have much more money to spend for their hobbies .and they are also more wise and they sometime know how to cope better with life adversities .
