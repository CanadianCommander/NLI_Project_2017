i dont think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because every day the number of people who use cars is increasing as i see .when i go out i with my friend , i can not hear her because of the car voices .wherever i look i see cars covered all around me .and we see that it is getting worse and worse day by day.10 years ago i couldnt see so many cars on the roads but today people have to wait for hours to arrive home because of the heavy traffic .the situation is just for my country .if we think about all the countries in the world , the number of cars is horrible .in china most people use bcycles outside .but they are alone .even if thet do that cars in use are increasing .if only all people in the world did that .if they did , the roads would be very quiet and also the atmosfhere would be cleaner .but if we look today it is impossible that there will be fewer cars in use .unlike today the number of cars in use will have been so increased that we will not walk on the streets .if it will continue like this it will damage the environment , too .we are damaging whole world and in twenty years we will not find anywhere to live .using cars is also cause the decreasing in petrol .we are consuming so much petrol that it will not be enough .so we can not drive our cars without it .maybe it will be better because if there is no petrol there will be no cars .i think people have to be educated about this .while they are doing this they do not know that they are damaging both the environment and the atmosfher .
