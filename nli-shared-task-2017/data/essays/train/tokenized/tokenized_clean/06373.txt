cars play very important role in our lives .although they cause a lot of problems , for examples , traffic problems and pollution , they still one of the most convenient tool for us .i can not imagine if we dont have cars in our lives , what our lives will be .in twenty years , we may find solution to deal with the problems , wich are caused by cars .however , it does nt means cars will be fewer in use than there are today .first , as the main economy support , cars are very important to many countries , not only the developed countries , but also the developing countries .now , the consumption of cars is increasing in many developing country .for example , china , according to a report for chinese consumption this year , cars become the chief production for chinese to spend money on .more and more companies to sell their cars in china than before .china has a large number of populations in the world .as a result , there will be more cars in use in the future .on the other hand , although we can use other trasportations , such as subways , electronic buses , even bikes , which are common in china , we can not ignore the great use of cars .cars are no doutly the most convenient tools for us .we can drive car anytime to anywhere .unlike subways , which has limit of places , we can reach where we want to directly and without time restrict .it is true that cars cause many problems , one of the biggest problems is pollutions .i think with the improvement of science techonology , cars will become more available than today .in fact , a lot of country and companies devote large amount of money to reseach new cars wich will reduce pollution effectively .in sum , cars will not be few , but more in use in the future .because they are the primary economy support and most convenient and necessary tools for people s lives .
