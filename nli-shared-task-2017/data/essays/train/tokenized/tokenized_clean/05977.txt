i do not agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .in fact , i believe that these days young people feel more responsible towards their communities and try to contribute towards them .these days , because of the advent of faster and better means of communication and transport , young people stay well connected with the world around .by means of tv channels , internet etc , young people are more informed about whats happening in their communities .this awareness , has also made them more responsible .for example , whenever some accident or a catastrophe occures somewhere then the news is spread very fast because of the faster means of communication .and one can see that there are several young people who willingly provide help in such situations .they provide services to the hospitals , are ready to donate blood and what not .clearly enough , in this case they are contributing a lot to their communities .the current young generation has grown in an atmosphere which is more free and liberal than ever before .they have always experienced this freedom of choosing what they want to do .and so they also choose the kind of community which they want to belong to and also in what ways they want to connect to their community .obviously when a work is done by free will and not by force , it is done more willingly and in a more inspired way .so in this case since whatever the young people do for their communities is done out of free will and not by force , so they do it in a more inspired and dedicated way .and hence they spend more time helping out their communties .for example , these days young people have opened up different kind of community centers or groups for helping their community or society in different ways , for example centers for animal rights , center for education for the poor and so on .all these groups or centers are made out of interest and motivation , and so the young people who work in it work with great devotion and zeal which is clearly visible in the amount of work such centers do these days .so clearly young people these days are more informed , free and motivated and it clearly reflects in the amount of time they devote to helping out their communities in their own way .
