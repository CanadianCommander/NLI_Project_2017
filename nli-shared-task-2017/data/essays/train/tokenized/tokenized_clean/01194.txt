it is likely that to specialize in one specific subject is beneficial for people who have decided to develop their carreers in a certain area , but i think that , in general , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more helpful in our lives .first of all , to obtain a great number of academic encourages us to have many options or choices with regard to our intellectual activities as well as our careers .if one has knowledge of only one fierld , he or she can not revise the direction of life .for example , my old friend had a prominent knowledge about iron industry and he decided to get into a certain large iron company .fortunately he joined the largest company in japan , but the iron industry faced a serious recession later , which required him to take advantage of another skill or knowledge which he did not have .i think people ought to be as versitile as possible , and ramify their lives according to condirions and phenominon .secondly , to develop a diverse sequence of knowledge help us find what we would have never found .when i worked for a life insurance conpany , i was studying the neiboring industries such as the property / casuality insurance , mutual funds , and investment banking .then , the idea that it is possible to make a innovative products by mixing the features of each industry had occured to me .and eventually , i became one of the member of our project in which we established a financial holding company under which there are now several financial institutions .in addition , i am in charge of product development , especially high-brid product which consists of both life insurance and mutual fund .in conllusion , for the reasons pointed out above , i definitely think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
