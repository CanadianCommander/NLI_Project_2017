enjoying the life is more dependent on the factors like age , culture , workatmosphere and many more .if one counts all the above factors it s more obvious that young people enjoy life more than older people do .a young person will be having the zeal to develope himself among the competitive world , here a person undergoes lots of pressure and stress may due to the work or due to the climate they work under .so most of the people tries new ways to relief themselve s from stress and strain so they outmost try to opt entertainment such as movies , parties and every possible way to get relief from the day to day work .young people enjoy not only with the people of their age group , or of the same culture , but they mingle with each and everyone , they find out new ways for entertainment .they tend to locate different places and attend parties .on the other hand old people tend to a similiar age group , they enjoy sitting with together and participate in religious function s .they donot feel that much stress or strain as the young people do .as youngster s would be more energetic than the old people thay do have lot of aspect s for entertainment and fun , they have their unique way to celebrate , share their ideas and cultures which most of the old people wouldnt prefer .mostly old people constrain themselves to a limited part , it does nt mean that they wont have fun and they do nt enjoy .they will have their own way of life and their own prespective of living .they constraint themselves to the religious function s , or else with the small get-to-gether with the family member s .most of the old peole prefer pleasent and stress life after their dutie s , they prefer clam and pleasent atmosphere arround them .in my point of view the statement given can be stated as the contradiction of the past and the present life of a man , since every old person is a youngster once a time before in the past .as a conclusion i want to agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy the life more than old people do  .since it s not the comprasion of past and present but it s a comparision between two races such as old and new faces of a person .i would end this by concluding that `` young people enjoy more than the old people do  .
