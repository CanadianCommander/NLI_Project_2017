some people believe that it is better to have broader knowledge than specialize knowledge , others think not .in my opinion , i would agree with this statement .there are many reasons as followed .to begin with , we could combine many different knowledge into one way .if we learn as many academic subjects as we can , we might put them together one day , and inventions will happened .take the invention of cellphones for example .as we know , somone invented traditional phones , he used his academic field to invent it .but , nowadays , we increase the profits on many special kinds of cellphones .that is , what will make commercial profits ?it is not only the professional part but also combines others , such as ads and designs .in addition , we can communicate with each other by using other several academic knowledges .in the other words , our friends may appriciate us because of our wide knowlege .we will not have a good social relationship if we only concentrate on our own field .it is because that we are too boring to stay with .thus , we should get more and more academic subjects as we can , then we can chat with any kinds of friends who take part in different fields .however , we should also specialize our academic subjects .it is because that when we work in our professional part , we should give a confidence to our customers , it is impossible that we put too many emphasis on other things but can not answer any questions which our customers asked .moreover , we should study hard to our own academic field and we could get a better job than broader knowledge .as all reasons i have mentioned above , the first is that it is important that having broad knowledge to combine them into a new one .the second reason is that it is easier to communicate with any kinds of persons .furthermore , if you want to get a better job , you should specialize your academic subjects .
