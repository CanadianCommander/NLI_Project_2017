i agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ..first , a broader knowledge of many academic subjects enables an individual to be diverse : being involved in different projects , conversations , and work groups .by concentrating on one single subject specifically , a person might always be involved with the same people , performing the same tasks , and thinking in a similar way .by having knowledge , as broad as it might be , of different subjects , an individual is rescued from monotony and involved in interesting and dynamic conversations and group work .let us say that a student is specializing in biology .if he only works on this specific academic subject he might grow tired of having the same conversations and working on the same types of projects .if , on the other hand , he included some subjects on engineering and arts , for example , he would get involved in different conversations , making his life more interesting and helping him grow , maybe even in the area of his preference , biology .second , knowledge of many different subjects enables one to know , identify , and appreciate the connection and relationship between different subjects .this is especially important in problem solving .for example , a specialist in manufacturing processes might normally deal with problems related to equipment , tolerances , and procedures .faced with a problem not related to what he would normally deal with , this person might feel overwhelmed and not know how to deal with the problem .however , if this individual decided to acquire a general knowledge about logistics , administration , and human resources he might know , at least , what direction to take in order to solve the problem .knowing an array of different academic subjects in a broad level compared to specializing on a specific subject , ensures diversity , scope expansion and more developed problem solving skills .
