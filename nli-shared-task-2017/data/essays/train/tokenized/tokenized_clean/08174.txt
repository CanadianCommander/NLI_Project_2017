i do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do .first of all i think that young people have something that frequently is not possesed by elderly ; that is good health .good health means basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new countries .it means also the possibility to practice new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air .for example but it is also necessary to live with dignity .secondly , young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends , go dancing , practice known sports , stay up late without any problem .moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems in concentrating and remembering the things they learn .this problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new things reading books , which i believe it is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy .another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lacks in older people .to end up i would like to touch a very important issue that sadly affects our developed countries .in several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartments or even wostly in retirement houses .the frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded as unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen as a possible to enjoy life .
