getting the problem solved by your self i s appriciatedi take the pleasure of disagreeing with the statement because the student can understand ideas and concepts when he is taught by someone else but not by him self , when he wants to learn he has to workout by himself to learn the facts .if he is taught by someone else he might not be that able to explain the same thing to the other person that effectively .he might gho wroung but when he tries to explain the things which he himself had learned he can be more effective and can easily explain what he learnt .for example :the person can not sit on the swmming pool and just understand the idea of swmming , he can learn swmming if and only if he himself get in to water and tries to swim .in the same manner he ca nt just guide his fellow person to sit beside the pool and understand `` how to swim ?  they are sometyhings that should be done by learning only , like learning bicycle , swmming , hourse riding etc . .a person can not sit on the poolside and measure the depth of the pool he can do this only if he jump and see the depth of the pool .the things that lags with the concet and ideas are that they dont have the essence of doing the things practically .`` the first person who came on the earth do not have any concept or ideas  the thing is he got the ideas only when he started doings the things .these works gave birth to the ideas and concepts.i would like to discuess one thing here what i fthe scientists would not work out for the things and sit with an idea he can not go forward and invent these lots of things for us .learning facts gave birth to the concepts and ideas .if fact if the child dont know how to ride a cycle he could sit at a conner and listen to the concepty but can not ride the cycle unless he try it out .for emaxple a group of friend go aroung to a racing club there they found that the idea and the concept that they had is diffferent they will be shocked to see the club i fthey r lerned practically they can drive the car in the race .here i end my topic .
