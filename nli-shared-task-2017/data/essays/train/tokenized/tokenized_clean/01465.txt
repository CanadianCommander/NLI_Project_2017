i think that young people enjoy life more than old people .there is lots of reasons for this which are genrally based on advantages of being young .let me explain these reasons one by one .first of all young people not as experienced as old ones .because they are lack of experience , everything appears something new to them and they enjoy dicovering these new things .for example for a young people to go to a new country can be so much enjoyable because he is doing something new .a new experience which may create unfamilliar feelings .but on the other hand it is not that much attractive for an old man who had this kind of experience several times .secondly young people have less responsibilities which give them more fredom .a young people generally only have his or her responsibility .so he can make his programs without depending to others .he do nt need to take care of a baby or shedule his holiday acording to child s school like old people .fredom is also one of the key words that makes life more enjoyable .an other reason is energy of young people .the energy of young people also an advantage which makes them enjoy life more than olders .when people are young they have energy to do everything .at it is not only an individual advantage .as all young pepole have this energy they can create more positive atmosphere than older people can .so they can also benefit from this advantage by using synergy of group .they can make parties till late hours , dance and laugh all together .they are capable of this activities with their long lasting energies .as a conclusion it is obvious that young people have so much advantages to enjoy the life more than old people but there is no need to feel jelious about it .in fact sooner or later young peop will get older .as once older people were young .
