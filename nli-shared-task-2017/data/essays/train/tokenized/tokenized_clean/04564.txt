i agree to the statement .there are many steps on developing students  cognitive capacity .students are learning from imitating their parents and teachers .and they are learning the facts by taking lessons from them .leaning facts is very important .students learn from historical facts and scientific facts .those facts that they have learned may stimulate the students  cognitive capacity and interest .but when they learn only facts without understanding ideas and concepts they just memorize and simply accumuklate them to their knowledge .`` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .when students understand ideas and cncepts it is harder for them to forget the facts than they just learn facts .when students understand ideas and concepts , they can learn why the facts come to exist and how to develop from the facts to the further levels of knowledge .there are basic ideas and concepts underlying the facts .students should know them to connect the facts that are related to .knowledge is accumulation of facts .but students need to apply the facts that they have learned into thier real lives .to apply the facts that they have learned into their lives they must understand ideas and concepts underlying the facts .when they understand ideas and concepts they can develop more from what they have learned .further inquiry based on the facts that they have learned with ideas and concepts will stimulate their academic interest and help them advance their learning and achievement .understanding ideas and concepts also help students to organize what they have leraned and how to relate to one another in their cognitive organization .later on they can deliver and teach what they have learned to anohte students or their students who want to know more about the facts .teaching ideas and concepts to their friends and students will help them learn more easily from them .therefore understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learing facts .
