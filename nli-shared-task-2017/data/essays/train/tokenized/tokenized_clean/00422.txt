i do not agree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide  .firstly , because i do not think that anyone could pretend order travel either alone or in a group .traveling is one of the pleasure that is generally at your own discretion .if people does not feel comfortable to travel in a group , it does not means that they are not going to enjoy their trip .for them , traveling in a group could be the best way to waste your money and time .one are not going to be able to do everything one wants .secondly , for people who like traveling in a group , they could like to travel with people they know .so they would have somewhat the same interest , and will be most likely able to do the same thing .in that case , they could want to prepare their trip by researching all the information they need before leaving .for example , they would looking about the hotels , where to eat , what are the attractions , and so on .thus , they will avoid the need of a tour guide .they will ends with the satisfaction of planning their trip , and seing only what they wanted to .finally , travel in a group led by a tour guide could be expensive .a tour guide usually also has his `` own path  .it is a generic pathway made for everyone .it usually have a lack of flexibility .for instance , with a tour guide people have usually a tight schedule .the tour guide tries to show everything in a very short amount of time .therefore , one has to be in good health condition in order to accomplish what could be viewed sometimes as painful path .in conclusion , i personnally believe that the best way to travel depends on individuals .one could be a solitar , and enjoy the pleasure of traveling alone .other people enjoy just the fact of researching , planning to travel with friends .and finally , the fact that a tour guide is not personal and only show what it wants to shows , are the three main reason what i do not agree with the statement .
