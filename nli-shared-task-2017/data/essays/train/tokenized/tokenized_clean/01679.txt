i do not agree with the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do .even though the young certainly are in better position to enjoy life in terms of their physical conditions , that is better health than the old , but this is clearly not the only factor to enjoy life .let me provide a few reasons i do not agree with the statement .first of all , one great factor to enjy life is financial resourses .to put simplest , it is very difficult or even impossible to enjoy life to the full without enough money .this is obvious , because , say , who would pursue enjoyment f life under serious financial pressure or with constant worries about making both ends meet .under that kind of circumstances , it would be realistically very challenging to do so .since most , if not all , of the old have relatively more financial resources that they have acccumulated by years  of employment , savings , properties , etc. , they are in better position to enjoy life than most young peple in terms of financial resorces .secondly , as they have lived long enough to know what life is , they generally have better or more appropriate perspectives , values , insight into life .quite obviously , with their extensive expereince of all sorts and education , learning , and so forth , they do have wisdom , which is so important and valuable in living a god life .this is definitely a positive factor in enjoying life to the full .
