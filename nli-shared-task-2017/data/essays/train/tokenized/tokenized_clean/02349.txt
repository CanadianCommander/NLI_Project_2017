nowadays it s verry common to travel in a group .it s possible to travel all over the world in many different groups .for many people it s the best way to travel .they mean it s more interesting and it s also easier to organize .you just have to go to a travel agent and sign up for the trip .for me it s not the right way to travel .i like to go my own way may be together with a friend .i do nt like to travel in a big group .together with a friend you have more freedom to organize your own route .on the other hand , it s normaly much cheaper .the first reason i prefer to travel for myself is the freedom .i had the expirience in a group .we just saw that what the guide want to show .all the places we saw were verry crowded with other tourists .when you organize a trip together with a friend you can choose your own route , you can decide what you will see .you also can choose some hidden places , but this places are sometimes much more interesting .you can choose places they are not so crowded with many other people .you can say when you will arrive and when you will go .you are more independent when you travel for yourself .the second reason is because it s normaly cheaper to travel for yourself .i prefer to sleep in a hostel .i was last week in hawaii .i slept in a hostel .one night was just twenty dollars .to travel with a group in hawaii is verry expensive .i could afford this trip to hawaii just because i selpt in a hostel .otherwise the trip would be to expensive .when you sleep in a hostel you can normaly use a kitchen there .the food is this way also much cheaper .normaly you spend an abundant amount of money just to feed yourself .when you cook for yourself it s cheaper and you can cook what ever you like .you can take also a public bus to travel .this way is much cheaper than a expensive tourbus .in conclusion i prefer to travel for myself because i can go my own way .i m not dependent form a whole group and a guide .it s also affordable for my wallet .traveling is verry nice and every person sould do .
