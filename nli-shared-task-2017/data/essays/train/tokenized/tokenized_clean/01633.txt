people are doing things in different way and they learn new things and face the consequences from that things .different people are doing in different manners .successful people try new things and take risks .some people are doing what they know and how to do well .these people are not taking any advices from other people .those people are not fairly success in their careers .but successful people are always trying new things and take risks from that and get well on that .for example successful people are always trying the new things and take risks from that experience and from that experience they will try again and finally they succeed on that .some times these people are trying new things and risks are more from that .these risks are some times giving the negative results and will give the negative consequences also .but these consequences will give the good lesson for doing again that experiment .they know the where it is the mistake and where it is correct for getting the good results .i agree with this statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .for example i have seen one of my professor he was doing always the new crossings in different crops .he always try to do that which characters are crossed with characters and how it improve the yield parameters in that crops .he always try this crossings and face some of the risks in that crossing programmes and finally his release the varities of rice .from this onwards i thought successful people are always trying new things and face the riska and finally they get on well that experiments .
