when you are a student , there are many different ways in which you plan your studying or , in the other hand , the way your teachers or professors help you to do it .i believe that when you are a teacher you must have some points clear when teaching your students and with that i mean that you must understand that is more importan that students understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .when a student learn concepts , he or she is able to manage general ideas and adapt what he or she have learned to solve or explain some other situations that will come in his future life , when the student learns things simply as a fact , that idea can not be adapted or foccused to understand or explain other topics .when the student starts a process of learning there are different forms in which they keep the information they recieve .the first one is understanding ideas .they need to understand the general idea of the topic and they must be able to relate it to common daily things .understanding ideas will help the student to work with the principal idea of the topic , it will help him to see the main point and will help the student define in an accurate manner the caracteristics of it , that means , he will be able to give a concept .when we talk about an specific topic some times is very difficult for the students to express what they are thinking , you can have the idea but you can not transmit it to other people .if a student learns only facts , probably those facts are unique , that learning will only be useful in that specific situaction , you can not generalize , so de student will not be able to use that knowledge in order to solve any other problem .what is necessary for the students is to catch the precise information , that means , to get the concept clear , to understand the main idea and over all , the student must be able to transmit that knowledge to other people .that is why is very important that they understand ideas and concepts .when a student is capable of transmiting the information he learned ( ideas and concepts ) to other people we can say that he really learned what we expected .
