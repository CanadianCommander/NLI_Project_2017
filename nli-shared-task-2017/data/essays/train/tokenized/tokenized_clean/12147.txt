the actual word is a word of stress , activities , and business .most of current young people have activities and daly occupations , but i believe that amoung those young people some have time to help their community .i realize that time is precieus and because of that i may be influence by that reason to say that i have no time for others , but it is not the case .for example , i am involve in a student union and one of my duties is to bring some love around .also , there are differents ways to spreed this love .for example , sheltering homeless people by providing them with food , clothes , and covers .by that kind of of positive actions i get involve in the good of my communities .next , it is more ofen young people that organize car wash or parties to raise money for example to ameliorate their school , or environment of work .this is a evidence that shows they are involve in what is happening around them .finally , even babysitting is a way to help your commmunity .you help a familly , neighbours that are in difficulty by giving them your help .so in that way you help around you mand youin conclusion , by getting involve in my society i realize how it works , where are the issues , and try to solve them thanks to different kind of experiences .i also believe that after have done something great , i feel better , proud about myslef because i have been busy but for something that will help around .i am sure that a bunch of young will be agree with me because of the positive sens .
