i disagree with the following statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because our world is packed with information to learn and to understand .also to get an idea of something like an animal we need facts and not ideas .first main point is , that our world consists of information and anything is filled with information .facts are easier to learn .on the other hand , sometimes it is also an advantage to know the idea and concept behind a project or a war .to illustrate , i like to know the facts and not to imagine why and what the reason for the war was .aditionally , the only thing people and i have to know are the facts .i take the war as an example .many people are talking about what the idea behind the war was , but that is not interesting , just when it started and how many boats the americans had and when the d-day really was .the idea behind all those things i really dont want to know .facts can also learn me to learn .for example , i sit at home and have to learn french .although the language is difficult , i do not ask me the question how the language could have had such a evolution , i just learn it .fact by fact .the second main point why i disagree with the shown statement is , eventhought information and concepts are good or helpful , i never learn everything right .to learn i need facts and not curios ideas and silly answers .for example in school , all the teacher learn us facts and not ideas .to know something about a flour or a lake , a ocean or an animal i and all the other people need the facts to understand the topic of what we are sudying .in conclusion , i think everyone need both like ideas and concepts and facts , but to step up in our life i need to learn and to learn you need facts .facts are the base for our knowledge .thats the reason why i disagree .
