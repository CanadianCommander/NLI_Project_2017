i disagree with the opinion that number of cars in use after 20 years will be less than what it is today .instead i believe that the number of cars in use will rise and will be much more than what it is today .i have number of reasons to support my opinion .the world population is growing at a high rate .since population and number of vehicles bear a direct correclation , i expect that with more people , more cars will be bought and used .it may be argued that more population does not automatically mean more buying power .but it should be noted the countries with high population such as india and china are experiencing high economic growth rates .this means that progressively , more and more proportion of population will have better buying power .this in turn means that there would be a bigger and bigger segment that will be able to afford cars and therefore buy cars .the cost of producing cars is also declining .again with cheaper cars , there will be more people who will be able to afford cars and therefore buy them .besides with research in identifying cheaper energy alternatives to petrol , the cost of running car is also expected to come down which will further encourage people to buy cars .the government spending on developing road infrastructure will also promote the car sales .governments tend to spend lesser on public transport as compared to constructing highways .this indirectly promotes car sales as limited and congested public transport drives people to buy their own vehicle .hence more cars will be used to avoid the inconvinience caused by public transport .also there are social reasons leading to disintegration of joint families into unitary families .besides the women that were previously more confined to home are joining the work force and moving out .this means that while previously one family of say 10 people could do with one or two cars , now a family of 5 needs two cars .the continued disintegration and women moving out of home will therefore fuel car sales even further .besides , as humans get wealthier , they look for more convenient options .it can not be denied that car provides the flexibility to take you right through to the destination as opposed to public transport such as train and trams where a person needs to walk to a stop or station , board the train or tram , then get down at destination station and again walk to his final destination .with more wealth , people will definitely demand more convenience and hence shift to cars .for all the reasons above , i strongly feel that there would be more and more cars with every passing day .cars are today most flexible and convenient way to travel .for number of cars to go down , there has be a even more convenient alternative .since i do not see any such alternative in next 20 or even 50 years , i see more and more cars hitting the road .
