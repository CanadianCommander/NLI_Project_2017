in my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subjects .firstly , in many academic subjects , you need a overview about several topics to understand the relationship within one topic and between different themes .i study economics at the university of applied sciene in nuremberg .for example in finance i have to know the theoretic basics in finance but i also need the knowledge of mathematics , tax and law .so i am not only specified on one subject .during the semster , we have many differnt subjects which all stands in relationship to economics .for example , marketing , finance , law , tax , accouting .english , general mangament etc .secondly , it is not sure , that someone always get a job in that subject that he has studied .so it is possible , that he had studied finance but now works in a marketing department .the situation on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledge .my friend studied logistics and now he is working as banker , but while his studytime he must vistited lectures of finance and assurance .so he has not that problems to work in this field .but there are also subjects in which it is better , when you are specified .for instance in medical : it is not possible , that every doctor knows everything .you need someone for skin deases but also someone who has knowlegde about cancer .in this case it is of advantage , when you have a specific knowledge .on the other hand it so for the human brain impossible all to know .in a conclusion it is to say , that it depends on the subject and how deep the subect is related to others .on the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledge , on the other hand it can be useful to be specialise in one academic field .
