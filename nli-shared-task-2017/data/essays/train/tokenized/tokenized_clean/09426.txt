gaining knowledge is a never ending process .hence knowledge is considered to be divine .knowledge has played an important role in life , which the humans always tried to attain .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a very good sign .knowledge is attained in various phases of life .from an adolescent stage in primary school to the graduate level .considering the aspect of undergraduate study in a field of science , consists of various academic subjects to learn .they form a pretty important basic block in the learning process .in this period of study each and every student is exposed to the different academic subjects that he/she is pursuing .each and every subject he/she learns is connected to different subjects .these subjects provides a variety of information which the students gain in the period of their study .if the study is restricted to a single subject being specialized then no of questions are left unanswered that are related to the respective field of undergraduate study .i agree with the gaining of knowledge with no of academic subjects is better than to specialize in a single or specific subject .specializing in a single subject in undergraduate level will lead to complex problems of the student not having enough information in developing a model which the student usually pursues in life .once the undergraduate study is pursued by a student , the student is more aware of different subjects and the knowledge he has gained in period of his study .all the knowledge he has gained is only a superficial layer that acts upon the student .the requirement of specializing in a single subject arises now .jack of all trades master of none  .the quote gives us an illustration of how the student is incomplete without a specialization of a particular subject .in conclusion having a broad knowledge with no of academic subjects is as much necessary as that of specialization in a particular subject .the study has to be in done in different periods rather in a single time .
