everyone lives in a communty that consists of peoples , in which , all the people , old and young , are supposed to join the community activities , and to help their community in many of aspects .however , nowadays , it is argued that young people do not contribute to their community than in old days i agree with this opinion , since i believe the young people do not have enough time , do not have enough chances to communicate with others in the community , and also lack of the good motivation to help their comunity .first , the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before , they have to work very hard to compete their peers , which make them really lack of time to have other activities insteading of working or studying .they spend all the time in the classrooms or office .and even when they go home at night , they will be so tired that can only go sleep at home instead of going outside to help their communities .the other reason is that , nowadays the communities in human society seem have less chance for the people , especially for the young people , to communicate with each other .for some stupid reaons , such as security , all the buildings in the cities are built like prisons .all the doors are locked so firmly that even the mice could nt get in .the people living in these `` prisons  are usally not familiar with their neighbors even their are living in the next doors .this makes the young people do not consider their community as their own , and thus might not show up publicly so ofte .that s why they do nt even have the chnace to help their community .finally , the people of all society , including the young people of course , become less and less motivated to help their communities .as the economic development of our society , the people more and more focus on money as the value of the life , while disregard the good reputation they might earn from the society .usualy the young people will obtain nothing except some apreciation form their community if they do contribute to it .this make them feel valueless to help the community , and thus spend less and less time to take part in the community activities .to summerize , the young people indeed contribute less time to help their comunities , and i think it s the problem of our cultrure nowadays , which actually encourage the people disregard their communities , and do not allow the people have enough time to paticipate the activites of their communities .i think it would be better for our future , if the young people can do more for their coummnities .
