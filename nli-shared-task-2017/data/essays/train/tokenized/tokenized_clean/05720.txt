have i ever been lost in foreing country ?some people may think the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , however other might support that it is not the best way .fortuhermore it is seemed clear to me that it is most efficient and useful idea .because of having a no knowledge about the place where people plan to visit and having a good experience .the first point i would like to make about the idea , there are several advantages about visiting with tour guide in a group led .first of all i agree this statement .hence in other country which we have no idea about how the life is there .because of the criminal activities or any accident such as getting lost .being sick and not available to speak native language .consequently i had experience about visiting to other countrt which is eygpt for touristic reason .i got lost when i was 14 years old and i couldnt speak arabic or french even english .thus i had rough time with finding my parents and guide can help and take care of us .on the other hand , i have a habit that i would like to discover everything because i believe that this is the best way of learning so because of what had happened me .i had changed my mind and i am supporting the main idea of text .because we have never gone there and the guide have been there more than us , which means we have less information than guide .clearly i have had experience about being lost , i had changed my mind to be a person who has a more knowlegde than i have so that i can enjoy and learn easyly .furthermore i would go next time with group led with a guide .
