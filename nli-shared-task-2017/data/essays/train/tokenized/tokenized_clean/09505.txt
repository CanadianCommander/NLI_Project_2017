i think that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of specializing in one specific subject for many reasons like : people will know more about life and about who things work , also , they will be more prepared to serve their society better because they know more , finally , they will help in developing thier societies because they are more educatied .first , when we give people broad knowledg , they will know more information then if we only give them one specific subject to study .they will be know a lot of information which they need in their daily life but if you specify your subject , there will be a lot of things you dont know about or have not heared about .if people had broad knowledge , they will be mor prepared and will help and assist their societies .during thier work time , general iformation which is gained through broad academic studying will help the worker a lot to do their jobs in a better way .unlike specifing which will lead into a narrow stock of information .when you train people and teach them about everything , they will becom a great help in developing thier societies .there will be more thinkers and inventors who can connect between large sums of information and that in it s self will help societies to develop and will benefit future generations .but if we only studied one specific subject , people will not be as helpful as if they studied more and gained more knowledge .finalley , for those reasons , i think we should give people a broad range of academic subjects ineasted of specializing in one specific subject .
