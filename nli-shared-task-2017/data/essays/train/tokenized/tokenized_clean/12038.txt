event though it is really important to understand ideas and concepts because they represent the basis of knowledge , i disagree with the statement because i think that learning the facts is as much important , as well .i have several reasons for my statement .first , i think that the facts enables students to understand a concept , because it is more concrete , it is a kind of illustration in a lesson .for instance for concepts in science , such as chemistry , it is not possible to understand a concept without experimenting a fact that illustrates the concept .the concept of status modification for solids , liquids or gaz can only be assimilated when we have learnt that water evaporates at 100 degrees and is frozen at 0 degree .secondly , students remember easier the facts than the concepts , because it is more interesting and less academic for him .for example , during field trips , students have good memories of their trip because they considered it as an entertainment even if the purpose of the trip was to teach an academic lesson .afterwards , students would remain the concepts because they would remain the trip and what they have seen during it .finally , it is more practical and efficient to learn facts than learn ideas .ideas and concepts are abstract notions that are difficult to learn and to represent in the mind .because they are very exhaustive in books , it is difficult to learn and to understand it without facts .if we take the example of children that learn ideas and concepts all the time at school , we notice that they know their lesson appropriately but finally they do not really understand what they have been learnt in class .so in my opinion , the best way to study is to learn facts as much as understand the ideas because they depend on each other .
