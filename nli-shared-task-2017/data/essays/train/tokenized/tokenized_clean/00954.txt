i agree with this sentence .even though most of young people have enough time to give a help for theif communities , they does nt do , i think .most of young people have time for themselves .for example , they play sports , see movies , and so on .they always enjoy `` their time  .there are few young people who have such `` time  .but in most cases , they do nt help their communities .because , of course , it is funnier to play sports , see movies .probably they do nt argue that they have enough time to help their communities , but in fact they do nt think that they want to spend `` thier time  on helping their communities , i think .we can understand this when we think a young person who is really busy .he does nt have time to do many things .naturally , he wants to do something he like to do and probably he does it .there are nt many young people who like to help their communities , i think .then , why do people help theire communities ?it is because these people have much thanks to their communities .they want to do `` reply  to their communities .so they spend their time on helping their communitiies .so , i argue that it is important to educate young people .for example , i think that it s good to make time to know work of their communities as one of school works .young people do nt know work of their communities well .so , they do nt have enough thanks to spend their `` precious  time on helping their communities .that is , it is necessary that young peple know local work of the people who help their communities very well .i agree with this sentence because of these reasons .
