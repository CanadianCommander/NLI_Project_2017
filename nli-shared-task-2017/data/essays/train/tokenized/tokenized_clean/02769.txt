it may be true that everyone wants to be successful .but to become succeed is not easy .if we refer to some people who have succeed in their life , we can find that what they did in order to succeed is not as same and simple as normal people do .it is common that people who were successful have a common trait .that is , they tried new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i agree to this .we can find the evidence of the statement as we read the articles of the lives of famous people such as thomas edison who was a genious in invention .also , there is a rule in the business that successful business people try new things and take risks .i remember readinig an article about the life of thomas edison when i was young .while reading it , i did nt understand why thomas edison tried to hatch an egg by himself , do experiments in the train , and other `` unpredictable  things he did .however , i now know that trying new things like him led to him as one of the successful people in the world , in invention .it is because he learned from his tryouts .he sometimes failed and succeed .when he failed , he learned why he failed from what he did by figuring out what went wrong , what needs to be improved , and so on .for example , he failed to hatch an egg because there is a certain conditions required to hatch an egg , the condition that hens have .on the other hand , when he succeeded , he become more confident encourage himself to try other things .without these traits , he would not be one of the successful people .in business studies , i learned that it is one of the facts that a successful business person tries new things and take risks , which is fairly true .for example , if a person wants to start running a business in ice-cream market , he should have superior and interesting ideas that catch the attention of consumers .to find unique ideas , he tries new things such as making new flavours of ice-cream which people did nt taste before , making interesting shape of the ice-cream , and so on .moreover , he should assume that he will be responsible for taking risks as he try new things .if his idea fails , then he should replace the financial problems resulted from the failure .however , as he get over these factors , he will later became a successful businessman in ice-cream industry .people want to be successful but it is true that most of them do nt know how to succeed .for them , i want to suggest to try new things and take risks , as statement said .
