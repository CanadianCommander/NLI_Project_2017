i totaly agree with that statement .people can find more things to do when they are young .also , young people can have more abilities to do something enjoyable than older people .that could be silly something to say when i am young because i do nt have any experiences maybe that question must be asked older people .they would compere this better than me .but , of course , i have some ideas and information to say .for example , i play soccer and really love it i ca nt think one day i am going to quit it .i mean l always think i ll never be old .but , i know that is impossible .so , one day we will not be able to do what we want to do right now .even to think about that is horrible for me .that s why as a young person i have been trying to enjoy until i lose my abilities and power .on the other hand i do nt mean older people can not find anything to enjoy .otherwise , that would be better thing to commit a suicide for them .even altough everthing when there is a life there is a hope .people must be strong and keep their energy for ever .of course there must be some good things to enjoy for older people .in same ways , they can make themselves happy and they can put themselves in enjoyable life .that depends on their personalities that can be changeable from person to person .finally ; considering everthing , as for me , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
