it is true that facts could be helpful sometimes .it is for example quite good to know some important dates of history or some names of important politicans .however , i completely agree with the statement that it has a bigger effect for students to understand ideas and concepts !there are several reasons why i think so .one is that if a student really understands a concept he can adopit it to new issues or circumstances .a good example is the concept of fieldwork , the basic method in anthropology .if i had learnt just the facts about that method , for example who invented it and so on , i would have had a lot of problems during my first real fieldwork in cameroon .but because i learnt the concept and ideas behind , i could adopt it do my specific situation .another reason why i prefer understanding concepts to learning facts is that during that process of understanding you will made up your own opinion and you will create your own ideas .so understanding is an important basis or fundament for further research questions or further thoughts in other areas and by the way you will learn all the important facts anyway , i am sure .as a last reason it is just much more interesting to learn concepts than facts .so all the classes and books i have taken or read which were based on concepts and ideas , i really loved .and i can still remember the things and topics written in these books !but the facts i had to learn for some multiple choice tests i forgot the day after . .for all these reasons i think it is much more efficient and fascinating to learn and understand ideas and concepts on scientific issues during university time .and , after all , i think it will be much more useful for a further academic or other kind of career .
