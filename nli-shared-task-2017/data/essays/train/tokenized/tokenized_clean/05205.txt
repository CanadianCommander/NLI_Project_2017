i totally agree with the following statement .first of all , if you are someone who takes risks , you are someone who likes challenges , who are not affraid to experiment .from my point of new , it s a main quality if you have projects and want to be successful in them .for example , if you have a new concept for a business project , you take the risk your project wo nt work , but you also can be really amazed if it works : coming up with a new concept for projects that works means that you succeed in doing something new .in other words , beside the fact your project worked , you have a personal success feeling .also , people who come up with business ideas ( for example some kind of restaurants such as the first fast food , the first bar where you can read while drinking a coffee . .. )took the risk to give all of them and ending with nothing .but they tried , they believed in a new project and they finally succeeded so much that they became rich and also could , in the case of restaurants do franchising and extend what became a chain restaurant all over the world .however , some people prefer to keep doing what they already know to do , they do nt feel taking risk trying something new that may not work .this kind of people prefers the security , and i totally understand this feeling but from my point of view , if you keep doing what you know , you can end laking of confidence and be afraid of changing your life : keeping the same job and not trying to have a higher position , going to the same places not to risk to be desappointed by another place ( i m talking for example about a restaurant or your holidays destination ) .in conclusion , even if i understand the feeling of being secure , i do nt think this kind of people can be successful .so , from my point of view , the more you take risks , the more chances you have to succeed in your life
