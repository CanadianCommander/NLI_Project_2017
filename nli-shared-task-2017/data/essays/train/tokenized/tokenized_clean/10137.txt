i believe that both thsese points are important at certain level of study .if a person is going through his postgraduation or phd studies .he should be more specific towards his subject and intrerest .while during undergraduation studies , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subject .while studying in undergraduate program , we should have knowledge of many academic subjects .it helps us to immply that knowledge in our specialization subject .i have completed my bpharm .in this under graduate program i studied all the subjects like pharmaceutical analysis , pharmaceutics , pharmacology and biopharmaceutics .now i am planning to do my masters in pharmaceutics subject .and these other subjects will help me in any instance .because basically they all are related with research .pharmaceutics is related with new drug research but pharmacology deals with the effect of the drugs on human body .so there is one kind of interdepandability present between other subjects and specialized subject .now if we think about masters and phd program .it is neccesary to choose one specific subject .it is better to gain deep knowledge in specific subject if your aim is towards research and developement .without the depth knowledge of subject , it is not possible to make our carrier in research .at this level of study we are given special training for work .if we take the example of doctors .the only doctors and surgeons with the masters degree in chemotherapy can cure the patient from cancer , which is not possible for the general practitioner .doctors with specialization in anesthesia in medical field has decreased the death and and coma cases , which used to occure due to improper introduction of anesthesia .if we take another example of proffesors .the proffesor in history subject cant give knowledge about the mathemics subject .so i believe that the both kind of knowledge is required at different level of studies .both have important at different level of studies .
