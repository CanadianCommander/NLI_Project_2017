whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject has been controversial among many peoplr .howener , i basically disagree with the statement that broad knowledge is better .i have two reasons for this .this is because andmost of all , the age want specialist than generalist .as a matter fact , too many people know a lot of things , but they do nt have deep knowledge .furthermore , without specialized knowledge , one can not succeed in some field .accordingly , we should focus on the specific subject .for example , if student just learn about general idea and do nt study in-depth information , they would can not fantasticaly function in their field .from my thinking , i am sure that concentrate on specific subject is very very important .in addition , by focusing on some narrowed field , one can build his or her power of concentration .generally , poeple who do nt have power of focus are not likely to success in their field .besides , when we focus our body and mentality are strengthened .therefore , it is wise for us to concentrate on the specific subject .it is reported that 79 % people in the u.s live healthy and soundly when they focus on the specific subject .from this data , i realized that it is essential that concentrating on the specific subject .to sum up , i strongly support the perspective that it is better to have one specific knowledge than have broad knowledge .this is because it helps to succeed and live healthy .therefore , having the specific knowledge is one of the factors having positive influences on our education ,.
