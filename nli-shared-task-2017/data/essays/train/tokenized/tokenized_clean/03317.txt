with the development of the society , more and more people started to pay attention to how to success and what successful people usually do .recently , the issue whether the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well has been brought into focus .when it comes to this question , the majority people think the successful people can be successful because the new things give them a lot oppotunities .however , others regard doing what you do well as a better choice .as far as i am concerned , the successful people like to do what they do well .to begin with , successful people do what they do well will give them more chances to be successful .when you do something a lot , you will recognize it more details .you will know why it works like that , and how it works , so when you met some problems , you do nt need to worry about it .you can solve it yourself .and you can do it better than others .all of this will give you more oppotunities to success .one of my friends do the things what he is familiar with all the time , although he spent a lot time on it , he successful because of it .he does this better than others , the things he made is low price and hige quality .so a lot of people like to choose his product .aslo , successful people like to do the things what they know how to do well because they will have less risks .most of the people do nt want to take more risks in today s world .the risks may give them much pressure , and may let them lost everything they have .however , by doing the things what they know how to do well will be safer and aslo can earn lots of money .there are many people try to do new thing , whereas most of them ca nt success and lose what they have before .so these examples tells us we should do something we know it well .although , there are many advantages of doing familiar things mentioned above , trying new things also has its own benifits .nevertheless , jundging from all the evidence offered , we aslo can draw a conclusion that successful people prefer to doing what they already know how to do well .
