when people think of successful people , they think of a person who is willing to try new things and taking risks in life , a person who always jumps out of the comfort zone where he or she is so used to .i completely agree with this statement .in the business realm , new oppotunies are always there but lie in the hidden , unknown and risky areas .many people may see the oppotunity , but only successful ones are willing to take the risk to explore it .nowadays everyone is talking about the double-digit ecnomic growth of china and i believe no one on earth can not see the oppotunities there .however , only a small handful of them could actually take the action to jump into this unkown territory and strike great success .when students graduate from college , they usually think of finding a job related to their major .rarely do we see students are willing to explore new domains or unknown areas for more oppotunities .however , it is usually from these small group of students who are willing to experiment new things where successful people emerge .take my personal experience as an example .when i graduated with a computer engineering degree , i did not go routinely to search for an it or engineering job , but instead , i jumped into a very new field called `` bioinformatics  by spending another two years in graduate schools for a master degree .it was a daring move at that time because there was virtually zero `` bioinformatics  industry in the country i live in .however , two years later , i embraced the prosperous of the field .our society needs all kinds of people .sometimes we can not judge a person s success by measuring how much money he or she earns .there are many great successful people out there doing notable work to our society , the poor people and the environment .many of them had their careers , and had lived their life comfortably .but they did not choose to live on that way , but jumped out of the comfortable zone and did something more marvelous .in conclusion , with all the above discussions and examples made in different domains , i totally agree with the statement that successful people are those who are willing to experimenting new things and taking risks .
