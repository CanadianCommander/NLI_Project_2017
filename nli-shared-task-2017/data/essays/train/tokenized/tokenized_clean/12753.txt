i think that enjoying life is not a matter of age .when we talk about young people we usually think of fun , happines and party .on the other hand , when we talk about old people we think of , streess , work , family and bore .first of all , i think that to enjoy life means to do all the things that can make you happy everyday of your life , accepting things as they come , and if we can , making thing better .what i m saying is that not only young people can enjoy life , not only they have dreams , not only they can accomplish their goals .in fact some young people do nt enjoy their lives at all , maybe because they have nt found yet their goals in life or maybe because they do nt have any motivation to do so .second , i do nt think that someone is able to enjoy life more than others .you can enjoy life or you do nt enjoy it at all .in fact enjoying life is a question of attitude , how you face the reality , how you decide to carry your life , with all the problems and all the happiness it could bring .young or old , i think that we all pursuit the same goal ^ to be happy ^ , and i am sure that if you want to be happy you will enjoy every moment of your life , doing the things that you like and dislike , making your world a better place for yourself and the people you love , taking care of the things and the people you appreciate .all those things are a sing that you are enjoying your life .whatever you do , if you do it with pleasure , you are enjoying your life .in conclusion , i think that everybody , young , old , black or white , can choose how to enjoy life .
