i disagree with the statement .i know that older people works hard and have to take care of the family , bills and other stuff .but student s also have to study , obey parents and young people s life is limited .i born in korea .and my parents told me that i should be happy because i do not have to work .but they do not know what young people are going through .this was the typical life of mine before i come to u.s.a , go to school 8 , come home 3 : 30 , go tutoring from 4 until 8 , and then go to another tutoring .when i get home it s 1 a.m .maybe older people think that we live happy life we have no life for fact .and reason that we do nt have life is because of adults .we are told to do what our parents tell us to do .they tell us if you study hard you will have better life later .moreover , younger people have limited life young people can not work if their parents do nt allow them to work or drive .olders life are not they can do whatever they want .their life is made by their choice .older can chose wether they want to work or not .nobody is going to say ,  hey !!!you have to work !  because they are adult nobody can control them .they have their own right to be that way .however , think about the young people like high school students .they have to study for sat , psat , act , toefl ...etc. we also need to worry about friendship , look , love , and college payments .so many thing to worry about and the pressure of the parents .young people do not have the freedom of choice and they are attached to lots of tests to worry about .i bet old people do nt think that test is enjoy of their lives .for these reasons , the statement should change like this `` old people enjoy life more than younger people do  .
