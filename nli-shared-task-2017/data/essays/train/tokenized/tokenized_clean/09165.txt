i m disagree with the statement because all of people can enjoy their life , young people and old people .often young people are not near old people because they have a different outlook of life .young and old people can enjoy themselves but in a different ways .if i can do an example , i want to mention a different kind of things that can enjoy old people and young people .young people are actracted often by sports , cinema , crowd , noise thinks , they want always smile .young people looking for a new hard experiences , they are dinamics and they want to do always something new .old people in the past like the same things , but now after twenty years they are tired and now they like the relax things , like fishing , sleeping , reading , playing cards and they enjoy themselves also more than younger people .this can be an idea of the difference between the two different kind of people .in a particular case the rules of the people can be the opposite .some young people can have the same bahaviour as old people and old people can have the same behaviour of young people .if you are seventy years old end you are not unfit , you can do the samethings of a teenager , are nt you ?i saw an old person playing football very well for two hours and after going to swim .it is possible , in a few case but it is possible .instead recently i met a young person that prefers a sedentary life , i do nt know why but he stands for a lot of hours sitting on his harchair and he reads two books or more in one day .it is possible ?this are a particular situation in wich people have a strange behaviour but normally if you are a young boy you must do the young boy and if you are an old `` boy  you must do the hold boy .
