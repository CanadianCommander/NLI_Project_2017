i certainly do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .by the time people get older and more mature , they tend to enjoy life in a different way .they appreciate certain thinks which young people might not .moreover , do such statements depend on the circumstances people live in when they are young compared to those when they get older .beginning with the last arguement , the most important arguement , is enjoying life very much linked to the personal sitation .do people have a good family life ?how is the financial situation ?at this point major differences can occur .when people grow up in unstable family circumstances with a lack of money and less perspectives , life is not as enjoyable as a life as an adult , when people are able to influence how they want to live , how they want to study or how they want to live with their families .young people certainly do not have many choices concerning those matters , because they are dependant on their families .additionally , does an adult enjoy life differently .other thinks are much more appreciated when people get older .they might not be able to experience new things as much interesting and entertaining as older young people might , but they have other opportunities .thinks like going to theatres , balletts or operas are good possibilities to have fun and more enjoyable for adults than for young people .art in general is differently perceived by each group .moreover , can more mature people go on holidays or trips alone and generally don not need any kind of supervision .the aspect of freedom and the opportunities linked to it is probably one of the most important arguements in contrast of the above statement .although this freedom is linked with more commitments and responsibilities , such as the need of earning money and caring for a family with children .taking all these aspects into account , i can not support the arguement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .firstly , is the statement not detailled enough to be applicable for every situation and secondly is it a question of possibilities how to have fun .
