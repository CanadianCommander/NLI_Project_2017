selecting the number of subjects will basically depend upon many factors .however , selecting one specific subject and working over it would help to get complete command over the subject .but i personally believe that having command over many subjects would be better .firstly , it can help in making furthur studies .by choosing many subjects we can have command over a number of topics which can help us to use it effectively .for example , when i was in graduation i had a chance to take either one subject or two subjects .i then felt to take two subjects one as my major other as the minor .which helped me to learn both finance and marketing .i also felt the importance of selecting the two subjects when i want to make out the project in final semister .which helped me to work for two subject , which are finance and marketing .so i was able to prepare two projects which inturn helped me to keep up my final grades .secondly , it will increase our knowledge .when we study about more subjects it can increase our knowledge about all of them .when i was in school days we used to have general knowledge and moral science as our extra subjects .i felt great benefit of these subjects when i matured as a student .it helped me to participate in quiz competitions and also helped me to increase the helping nature where i learnt through moral science .lastly , it makes us to have a fruitfull career .when the time comes for me to make out a job , the command over different subjects can help me to secure a good job .where i can have a number of choices and i can choose the field which is good .so , it helps to have a good and fruitfull career .when i completed graduation , as i studied both marketing and finance as subjects in my graduation , it helped me to fetch a job in both the fields .so i had a choice to prefer .so , because of these reasons i prefer that learing about more subjects helps us in different ways .even though learing about a particular subject can bring specialisation , i still believe to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
