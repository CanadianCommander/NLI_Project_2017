when i was living in the united states , there was a short period of time , about a week or so , when i did nt have a car .to go to a supermarket , i had to walk for an hour , and imagine how bad it was to come home with four 5kg-plastic bags in both hands .i definitely needed a car in order to survive there .considering that cars are currently one of the major transportation tools among people in developed countries , i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because twenty years is just not enough time .to replace the existence of cars with other means of transportation would take more than twenty years to accomplish .it is said that the gas emitted by cars has a tremendously bad effect on the environment , a problem called `` global warming ,  and that countries are working to decrease the number of cars in use .however , in order to accomplish this goal , there needs to be other ways people can transport , such as trains and metro .it would be hard for any city governments to come up with a plan and to put that into action in twenty years .another thing that would be hard to change in twenty years is people s habits .when you have been using a car , for example , to drive to school everyday , you will find it hard to change the way you commute to other means , such as the train .it is hard for someone to make a change in their lifestyles , and he or she would need a definite reason for doing so .if the city made a law prohibiting the use of a car , this would sure drive the person to quit driving the car , but making that law in use would take more than twenty years .passing a law requires a lot of time .imagine the voices that would come about from the people when a plan to make this law arises .even if it does nt take a law to try to change people s awareness , i can not come up with another option .for the reasons i mentioned above , i believe it is impossible to decrease the number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years .to do so , there needs to be other ways people can tranport , which they could feel comfortable and convenient as cars .of course , there are places around the world , for example tokyo , where subways have been well developed and people do nt need cars to get around .however , from the experience i had in the united states , i would have to say that people there would nt like that .
