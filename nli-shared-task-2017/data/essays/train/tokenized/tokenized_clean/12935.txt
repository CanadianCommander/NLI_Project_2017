every person has their own definitions for enjoyment which might even change according to the various stages of lifes .i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .their is a vast age gap between the people compared who are in different phases of their lifes .young people enjoy life from their pure heart .they can do the activities which makes them happy , excited and feels them elevated on top of this world .no matter how small the task they have done they enjoy it completely .in contrast the expertise of life . , ie the old age people enjoy their life for the matter of satisfaction .at this age they start living for their children , their family .they will be ready everytime to compromise their dreams for the sake of their children .at this age they start thinking that they had lived their life completely now its the time of their children to live life , as the person grows older the problem of ego starts , he has to maintain his dignity according to his profession , the status in the society do matter , all these things deprives them from the pleasure that they could experience by doing few things which is really going to make them happy .young people , specially the children can perform certain activities which can not be posssible in the case of old age like asking few silly questions to their mothers which mothers do reply patiently , playing in muddy waters , children as such do not have any responsibilites on they shoulders .coming to the adolascents , they do enjoy lifes but here the definition of enjoyment changes .they imagine themselves as independent individuals who has entered a competitive world which is even filled with fun and entertainment .they have a huge responsibility on their shoulders of leading a successfull life .they are the young bloods who can party hard , work hard and accept the challenges of their lifes .in accomplishing them they gain experience and they even enjoy the difficulties faced by them .every person should enjoy till the time they are alive in this world .they should look their life as a challenge and face it darely and enjoy every aspect of it .young people enjoy more compared to others .
