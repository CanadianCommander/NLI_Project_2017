seeing how much energy a young person has , in contrast with an older one , you can think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .moreover , a young person seems to have less pressure on him , and the whole life-span in front of him , whereas an older one have already spent a great part of his time .so the statement seems to be right , but i am not of this opinion yet .in fact , i think older people can enjoy life more than young people , as long as they do not have physical impediments which are too big .when you have seen a lot of facts in your life and passed throught a lot of experiences , you gain a vision about life which allows you to appreciate every nice moment in your life .you are able to see the valuable things every days life can offer .on the contrary , when you are young and have still to show what you can become and what you can achieve , you have a lot of pressure on you .you are always trying to have more of everything , failing to appreciate what you have .too big ideals or goals make you not to see the beauty which surrounds you , because you are too concerned about finding your place in life .i can see that observing my parents , and the calm they have when they must front bad things .they know they have the ability to pass through bad situations , because they have already done so in the past , whereas any problem seems a new and diffucult one to me , because my lack of experience .of course a young body is more efficient than an old one .this fact would support the statemets quite well , but with all the improvements in medicine and in life style , i think it is not a crucial issue .lots of friends of my parents go biking every weekends , and they are probably better trained than me .moreover , you generally have more money to spend when you are older , and this is surely an important factor in how much you enjoy life .you have lots of beautiful things for free or at low prices , and money does not always mean happiness , of course .but some more money means the possibility of choosing what you want to do among a wider spectrum of things , and this is surely nice and helpful to enjoy life .
