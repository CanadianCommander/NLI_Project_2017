succesful people try new things and take risks .most important of succesful people s quilities are creative and activity .successful people always want to new thing and they are created .for example , in the korea .famouse musician moon jae sook , she is traditional korea instument ( gayagum ) player .acually gayagum is old instrument and the songs are not any more popuation .so , she was made of new song and she play .also she play westurn class music by gayagum .people surprised the gayagum s new sound .now , korea young traditional artist try make a new song .secondary , successful people are not only creative , but also they are activity .they do nt want just thinkig .if they got a idea , they make it reality .third , successful people has good people .recently most of important is relationship .varity relation ships are helpful all situation .so i agree that successful people try new things and take risk .
