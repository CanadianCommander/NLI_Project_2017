it is essential to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in order to specialize in one specific subject .once an indivudual has accquired a reasonable amount of knowledge on different academic subjects , concentrating on a specific area of interest can be estremely beneficial .a teenager that wants to study medicine has to complete four to five years of med-school in order to specialize on a specific area of medicine .this is simply an example which can be applied to any other career choice in order to demonstrate the importance of a how general knowledge and common sense contribute to the success of any professional .when someone concentrates all their attention on a specific subject , he is creating a social barrier for himself .this social barrier consists on the following : when attending a social event , the communication this individual will have will be limited to his specific subject of interest .he/she will not be able to have great imput in a conversation between the people present because he/she will be focused on another subject most of the time .when attending college , this changes .in my opinion , it is ideal to take one or two years of basic studies or liberal arts in order to have a strong base and be successful the following years .on the other hand , any professional that wants to be prosperous in his career , will have to , at one point or another , focus most of his attention on his major or profession .this does not mean that he/she will have to alienate himself from the world in order to do so .`` knowledge equals power  , and in order to say that someone is knowledgable , he has to have a vast scheem of interests and passions .when a balance in education and knwoledge is achieved , power and prosperity is the next step .
