in my opinion in twenty years there won  t be fewer cars in use than there are today .in such a short period of time nothing so important like using cars will be changed after all .many people think that in twenty years everything will be changed and we will have roboters doing our work .on the one hand it will be possible that we will use more technicals for many daily problems and there will be more technical discovery .but what can make our lifes more flexible and comfortable than cars ?how should we transport or export our products in other countrys or how do we get our post or go for holidays ?you ca nt reach any region of the country by bike or by plane is nt it ?and when we drive car we are faster in every situation of life .but on the other hand we hope that the use of cars will be fewer in a couple of years because they cause so much pollution and by time destroy our environment .everybody should use its cars only in situations which are essential not to drive to the neighbour e.g. but in my opinion it is nt impossible to realize all over the world .in addition what will be the cause of a fewer using in a few years ?that everybody has got a relationship to a partner in office so that they can drive together or do their weekly shopping tour together ?i do nt think so .for many people a car has a status of comfort and will help them in daily situations like bring their children to school when they live far away from there .from my point of view the using of cars will rise more in twenty years than everybody expected and not will be in a fewer use .
