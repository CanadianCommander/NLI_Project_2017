i agree with the statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing already what they knew .s uccessful people where ever they are in the world always they try new things because they are already succeeed in one field , they have enough money to take the risk and more over they lot of confidence to success the new things rather than take risk .successful people in one of the field get lot of experience from the field , like he will know how to get along with the employees and how to maintain his buisiness or company .how to convince the consumers with his product .by all this he will get experience how to run a company or business with the profit .and the profit is increased day by day then he will get lot of profit than the expenditure .then he will get a confidence , he feel like i can do new things , then he will start a new thing or business to help the people to give more jobs .eventhough he started a new buisiness he knew that if anything goes wrong he would have to take the risk .for example bill gates in usa , tata birla in india and reliance phone company owner beer bhai in india , these some of the buisiness magnets tried new things and faced risks doing lot of other things than what they know before .bill gates started developed small computer software and succeeded now he created many softwares and selling his products throught the world .tatabirla in india they started small buisiness in india manufacturing of cloths years ago , now they tried different new things like soaps , bed sheets , toothpastes , brushes , cloths and lot of other things we are using in the daily life , he became a big buisiness magnet in india .bheer bhai started his small local phone company in india , he tried new things became popular in the cell phones and long distance and even he is doing phone company buisiness with the usa and europe and with lot of other cuntries through out the world .my father also started agriculture on rice and he tried new things and took risks on cereala , oranges .always successflu peoplr
