from my point of view , young people enjoy their life more than people do .first off , confronted to less responsabilities than the grown-ups , they have plenty of time to enjoy life .thus , they just see the nice side of it .indeed , young people are usually neither married , nor parents .moreover , they do have parents who care for them and pay for them when they need .on the contrary , older people are less looked after and a part of their family is dead .they have to care for their survival .for instance , they must be sure to have enough money every day .all of this considered , young people have less to think about and that means , they have less problems about everyday s life .moreover , they do nt have lived much because of their age and everything has to be discovered .thus , they will have plenty of projects to acomplish such as travelling .when concerned about their future , they would make a lot of plans .as for me , dreams are very important .the goal you want to reach when you are young heve to be kept when growing older .for instance , i would like very much to study abroad and dicover a new culture .i am very attached in making souvenirs .i think when you are in an other country as every thing is new you will make a lot of souveirs in a short time .furthermore , you meat a lot of different people , actually imn my mind , young people are very interest in nez experiences whereas , older people have already made the larger part of their experiments .eventually , being young is a very confortable position .you can always relye on the perspective that you can possibly do in the future what you do nt have done yet .to conclude , i would say that feel very happy to be young .
