there are different ways to develop an activity or to approach to a problem .some people prefer to try new things and take risks .on the contrary , a more conservative group of people prefer only doing what they already know how to do well .but there may be succesful cases in both gropus .then , what is the best attitude ?when people stick to their own traditional methods they are able to solve basic , elemental problems , but do not have the psychological or intelectual resources to imagine a new possibility , a challenging solution or a new discovery .they fear failing , and feel more secure doing exactly what they have always done for a long time .these people do not innovate but maintain traditions and keep everything in its place and relatively under control .on the other hand when we try new things and ideas we touch different dimensions of the problem .we are not prejudiced by common opinions and statements and sometimes we can see or foresee completely different aspects of the situation .people who belong to this group are eager to take risks and do not fear failure , danger or doing special efforts in order to reach their goals .in this case , people have to be energetic , very enthusiastic about their ideas and good team leaders .personally , i think that in order to succed you should try something new each time .it is very rewarding when you discover something that maybe was so close that nobody could see .even though you may find that many people turn against you because they think your ideas are ridiculous or stupid , you have to insist and keep on working because at last , things will go well and something very good will happen .so , next time you have to solve a problem , i recommend trying something completely new for a change .
