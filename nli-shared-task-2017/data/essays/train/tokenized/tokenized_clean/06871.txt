the best way to travelthere are many different opinions on the ways for traveling .some people like to travel by themselves or with their friends while others enjoy their time with a company like a tour guide .those people who believe that the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide feel more comfortable and learned for they can travel and learn a lot of new information at the same time .however , i am one of those people who would rather travel alone or with my friends .the reason for this is because i do nt feel very comfortable when there is a tour guide around .firstly , i really like to have my friends or relatives around me while traveling because that s how i have fun .also , even when i do not know a lot about a place that i am planning to visit , i go online and get more information about that place .i read and get directions to find my way out easily rather than being with a tour guide .this is not necessarily because i do not like tour guides but it is just because i believe that i would have more fun while i spend time with people that i am very close .furthermore , i traveled many countries with and without tour guides .some of the places i went to are germany , russia , and holland .even though i had difficulty while traveling around because of not knowing the language , i still enjoyed my time during the vacation .on the other hand , when i was with a tour guide i felt like i was under a lot of pressure to listen to every detail that he provided .for instance , when i went on a tour in a museum in germany , i got very bored and tired because of the explicit and unessential amount of information provided by the tour guide .my tour guide kept trowing dates about the important buildings and no one really paid attention because everyone expected to learn some interesting facts rather than simple dates on the tour .i think i would have enjoyed my trip better if i was by myself .lastly , i like to have conversation with my friends while traveling .but when there is a tour guide and a group of people around me , i can not get chance to chat with my friends because talking would be very disrespectful .therefore , with a tour guide i can not really enjoy my time even though it is ver nice to learn new information about the places that i visit .
