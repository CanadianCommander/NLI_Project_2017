i do agree with the statements that succesful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is the calculated risk that a person takes that shows his confidence and attitude towards life .trying out new things keeps a person from getting bored with the routine type of work .taking new risks always has a chance for growth not only in what he/she is doing but also as a person .i can state my own experience as an example .i ve always been a topper in high school with excellence in mathematics .after graduating from high school most were taking up engineering and accounts for undergraduation .i realised i had an interest in sciences and dared to take the risk to face the competion to enter into a medical school .finally not only did i get into one of the top medical schools with 98.5 % but also got a financial aid .all through the way i believed in myself and never let my confidence fall apart .and then i realised that i had a taste for music , which led me to become a disc jockey .i used it as a way to relax my tensions from my academic curriculum .people thought how can a ` ld be doctor possibly be a dj .well , i know it sounds weird , but i wanted to try someting new .it was just the start and the list went on from organising medical camps , awareness campaigns to starting a student organisation for sincerity , service and development .although you need discipline , hardwork and patience to reach goals , it is the difference which you make that matters .it shows the attitude towards life and the confidence with which we move ahead .successful people are confident people with a positive attitude who try out something new always and try to make a difference in others  lives .every new task is a challenge for proficiency and confidence .they always want to see life in a broader prespective filled with challenges .as a matter of fact , everybody should try out new things , which will develop their attitude towards life and will make them a better person .
