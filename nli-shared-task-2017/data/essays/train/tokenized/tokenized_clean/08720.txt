the world changes very fast .the people change with the world and they have to adapt them in the society on the best way .young people nowadays have different task to do from the people who were young in the past .today the life is very frenetic and a huge number of the actions and activities are really different respect 20 years ago .a young person have to go to collage or university , maybe he have to work if he wants to pay his study or others activities .the free time is not a lot so , when a student is free , he use to go out with his friends and to think about the enjoy activities like to go to disco or listening to music .someone can think that it is selfish but i am sure that a young person must have a leasure time .however the time can be spent for the communities .it s quite true that a lot of young people do nt like help their communities .the young newadays people are not all lazy .i can explane this point by a clear example .last week i went to a rock party which was organized by one of my best friends .he worked a lot becouse this event was wonderful , but he did it with others guys .the party was a music competition .the people were a lot and everyone was very happy because the players were fantastic and the organization too .in conclusion i think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy .the free time is less and the things to do are more .the young people mistake is to think that to do something for the communities is bored .fortunately there are some people who think different !
