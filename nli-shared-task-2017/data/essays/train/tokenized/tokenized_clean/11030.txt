i agree with the statement .i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the companies often mislead the customers by putting exceptions in very small prints , by over exaggerating , and by using famous actors and athletes in their advertisements .first of all , when i pay close attentions to advertisements , i often see advertisements with very small prints at the bottom that are hard to see .those prints states exceptions .for example , the advertisement may say , `` 80 % of people lose weight by using this product !however , i may see a print at the bottom that says , `` this is not based on scientific data .this is just one type of the `` exceptions  that most people do nt catch .additionally , the companies use catch phrases all the time to attract customers .they often exaggerate too much .for example , the advertisement of pills losing weight might say , `` do nt you want to look like a model ?by taking this pill , you can become really skinny easily like top models !do nt you think this catch phrase is a bit awkward ?pills do not make you look like a super model .it exggerates way too much .moreover , the companies often use famous actors , actresses , or athletes in their advertisements .for example , sports companies , such as nike , adidas , or puma , might use micheal jordan when advertising for basketball shoes .cosmetic companies often use beautiful actresses .the costomers assume that the actress uses that product and buy that product .also , in advertising for medicines , they companies use doctors and nurses who seem to know what they are talking about .by using professionals of each area , the companies are able to convince more customers .doctors are much convincing when talking about medicines rather than having some random shop keepers talking about the topic even if they were saying same things .to summerize , i agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the companies often mislead the customers by putting exceptions in very small prints , by over exaggerating , and by using famous actors , athletes , and professionals in their advertisements .however , you can not just blame the companies .to sell products and compete with other companies , that is one of the most important strategies .thus , you must be very careful in seeing the advertisements .
