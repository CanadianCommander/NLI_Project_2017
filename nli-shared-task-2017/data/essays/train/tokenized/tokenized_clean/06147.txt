in my opinion , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .first , sometimes the what we see or hear is not the fact .like long time ago people think the earth is a rectangle , because the roads are flat .but after several years of searching and experience , now the fact become that the earth is like a ball .so it is important to underatnad the ideas and concepts , then we wo nt be cheated by what we see by our limited vision .second , it is important to understand ideas and concepts because it s the way for us to get the truth and concepts .for example , after a stuent learned and understand the ideas and concepts , then they can use it to discover or create new stuff .i think that s why we envent lost of new things like car and plain to make our life easier .so i believe that understand ideas and concepts are more important for student .third , it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts because in this way , student start to think , and become creative .they can use their imagination to creat new ideas and conceptes , and their imagination is not limited by the facts .it s a good way to encourage student to search , think and find the answer they want .so it is not that important to let the student learn the facts .in conclusion , i believe that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .because in this way student can imagine and think freely , and creat new things that s unique .and it s good for us to find the truth and real facts .
