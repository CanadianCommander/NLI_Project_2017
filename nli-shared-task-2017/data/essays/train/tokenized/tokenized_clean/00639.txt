the number of cars on our planet is a very important problem but we are moving on the right direction and i think in the next twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the first point to support this opinion is that the oil is going to finish in not a long time and still now there are nt other tecnology as efficent for cars .therefore to use cars will be more expensive and less people would pay for that .another point is the air pollution caused by cars .infact the environment is damnaged by cars and to solve this problem the solution is to reduce the number of cars on the earth .finally the pubblic tranports are becoming more efficent and there are a lot of projects to construct new metropolitan line , railways station and to increase the number of buses , so iwill be more easy and fast to use pubblic transport .also the flights by planes are going to become more cheaper in the next twenty years and they will to cover more short distance lines , so an increasing number of people are going to use often the plane instead than cars .to conclude i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in cars than today
