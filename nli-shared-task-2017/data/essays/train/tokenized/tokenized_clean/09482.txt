i do nt agree with this statement .there are some reasons why i disagree with this statement because i believe that the relationships between the costomers and the company is very important for selling the products .first of all , if a company of a product advertises the product much better than it really is , the customer misunderstands about the product .it means the company pretends the customer .when the customer notice that the advertisement is not true , the customer will think that the company pretends him or her .therefore , the customer will never buy the product .second , if the maker use an advertisement which is not true , a lot of problem will happen .for example , when a customer bought a product which is advertised much better than it really is and use it , and then it harm the customer because of the not true advertisement , the customer will claim to the company .and if the problem becomes big news , the company will get huge damages .finally , if the advertisements make products seem too much better than they really are , they might be crime .in the case , the customer will never belive the company , and they never buy the company s products .to sell products , the company need to make good relationships btween the costomers and company .for making good relationships between the customers and the company , the company have to give correct information to the customers .for these reasons , i disagree with this statement .
