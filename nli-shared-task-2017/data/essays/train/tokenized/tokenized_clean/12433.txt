everybody has learnt from people in school , at home , concepts and ideas which we have to learn , and wee could call that education .but , in a life in general , each is confronted to different scenarii , situation , people , which impact behaviour or vision of life .that s why i will try to express my opinion linking both of argument and showing importance of each .first , let s talk about ideas and concepts , which are essential for student in order to have key elements and after to use them to make their personal opinion .i think learning the basis such as respect people , the law , history , are key ressources for the student , since they want to have in their possession the key values which allow them to advance in the society and to judge it by theirself .today , all the children should be able to follow a training dealing with ideas and main concepts , in order to have a perfect equality between young people , and so starting from the same point in the society , i mean the same potential .after , we could be afraid by this , assuming that everybody would understand ideas and concepts in the same ways , and so follow the same route of life , but at this point , my opinion is that learning facts remain essential for student .then , concerning learning facts , for my part i consider this point more essential than understanding ideas and concepts .indeed , what is making people different and more openminded ?i answer experience !i consider facts as example of life , things that appenned , from what we can really learn something concrete and acting further , considering what happenned before and what we learnt from that !the best example for that point would be for me the wars .indeed , living in the 21st century , we are obviously afraid by wars and we really want to avoid it for ever .this is based on what we learnt at school and from our grand parents , so from facts .this is an example of what we can learn by experience , and hence what we do nt want to see anymore .this was a sad example , but we could talk about facts that we want to recover or do another time .this would the fact from every kind of pleasure or peace in the world .to conclude , i give importance to both points of view , becaude ideas and concept are essential to start life well , but the facts will remain the best thing we can learn because the experience will always be the most important ressource for each !
