i agree with that statement to a certain point .successful people are wealthy in most cases , so they probably have the money to try new things or even take risks .for example , if you take a look at the business world , you are able to find cases where big businesses put a new article on the market , even though they are not sure if that product will sell well .that s called taking a risk .the people behind the big businesses have the money to make and solve mistakes without having to suffer .they have the urge do create something new and please more costumers with their products .if they kept doing what they already know how to do well , they would probably get bored .it s in the human nature to try out stuff .humans are very interested in that .it s a kind of feeling that they have inside , almost like an instinct .on the other hand , i know for a fact , that there are also incidents , where successful people just do nt want to come out of their shell .they feel comfortable with what they are doing because they do it over and over again .they also have the knowledge and do nt really feel the urge to put themselves in a situation of risk .risk can have bad consequences and could ruin that person s life .it may lead that person to a break-down and ruin everything he already accomplished .some people are just not ready to put themselves in situations that contain risk .all in all , i think that it can be healthy to put yourself in a situation of risk , because there are times that this might make you stronger or even wiser .it is proven that people in risk situations are under tension .tension makes you work harder and gives you the opportunity to accomplish more .at the end , i have to admit that the statement ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well` , can be supported or not , whether it is right or wrong .
