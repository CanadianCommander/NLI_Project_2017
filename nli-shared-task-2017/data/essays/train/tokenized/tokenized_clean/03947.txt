though to specialize in one specific subjects is good , broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than it .there is two reason .first , it is important for us to live everyday .if we do not learn many academic subjects at the elementary school , junior high school , high school and university , we face many oroblems in society .for example , a lots of adults would become telling the most important things .if children watch such a adults , children would become bad , too .second , we learn many academic subjects , after that we learn specialize in one specific subject .so we are able to get a lots of knowledges .nowadays , a lots of people learn a subject who likes .i think that if such a person incresed , that country will die out .such two reasons , i think that we should learn more academic subjects than to specialize inone specific subject .
