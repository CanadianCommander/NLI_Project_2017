eventhough some people agree that after twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , ido nt share there opinion becuse of some spesific reason i have .first , world population is increasting rapedly and there is a need to use cars nowaday , becuse of that i belive because we need cars now how it could be in the future .second , new generation will have a driver licen to drive a car , but it does nt mean that old generation will desapper they will mixed up and will be to crawded in the streets .finally , i think the cars will not desapper they will be more and more cars than what we had today .
