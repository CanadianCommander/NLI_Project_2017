i agree with the satement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .there are some reasons for my opinion .firstly , young people are much more energetic than old people .so , young people can travel around and do a lot of activities , and thses make a life more enjoyable .there is my personal experience to spport this idea .my family once planed to visit new zealnd with my grand-mother .she was excited to go .however , as the depature came closer , she stared to hesitate to go because she thought it would be stressful for her own health .finally .she decided not to come .it was very shocking for us because we had planed all the trip with her .even if she could had come , i guess she could not have walked around the place and enjoyed the trip so much compared to us since she is no longer stong enough to do so .this experience made up my idea that old people are not able to see many places and do many kinds of activity .secondly , since young people generally have more curiosity , the world could be more exciting to young people .as a man grows up , he learns a lot and becomes wise .of corse this is a good thing .however , this means that his desire to know is somehow fullfilled .on the other hand , young people are still new to the world , and there are many things to learn and try .it is true that many old people are still curious and try many new things , but what i want to emphasize here is that old people tend to be inactive and do not have much desire compared to young people .thirdly , i think young people have more hope in the future .for example , a boy dreams to be a superman or a movie star .his mind is filled with hope and enjoyment .he may enjoy his life chosing his future .same thing can be said to elder young people , not to say superman , but perhaps a doctor .after their life to reaches to a last decade , there would be less hope for the future .therefor , the life is more enjoyable for young people .in conclusion , i think young can enjou life more than olds .
