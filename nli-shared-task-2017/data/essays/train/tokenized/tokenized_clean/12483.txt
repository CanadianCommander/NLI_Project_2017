i agree wth this statement .the experience of the most of the schools are that students firstable understand ideas and concepts before learn facts .some reasons are :in the first step , students should know the ideas and concepts of the things , because this method applied in our life .when we were child , our parents tought us in a first way the ideas of the things and then the facts .after that , we learned the facts , basicly , because our parents wanted to show us the thing that we proyected in our mind .this system was implied in generations for our parents and the schools follow the same method .other thing , it s that the idea or concept show us what we are talking about .we create an imagination of the thing in our mind .we clearly know what we are talking and what we are studying and that allows us to make a preliminary image before to know the facts .after that , the facts can be easyly .this make a better compretation of the definition .in adition , facts in the school can be use like experiments or practices , so it s helps to the student to undestand in a better way the idea o the concept .facts reflect the preliminary idea in the practice but we know them in ourhowever , both of them are important to give them to the students .it s necesary for the better compretation and the get better results in the students .school should take more importance in the ideas and the concepts , then the students in the job or in the simply life can use it .
