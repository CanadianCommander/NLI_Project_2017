to travel is one way to learn and extend our horizons about the world and life .i have some important reasons to travel without a tour guide .yes , i do nt prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide although i can not deny its pros .i believe to experience new things in your own world for yourself should be private .you do nt have to give up from your freedom as well .secondly , when we do nt have any schedule to follow travel may be more relaxing and be more stretching to expose things which are not familiar to us .one of my aim to travelling is to experience new things and be faced with beautiful or ugly things during this travel .to read about one place s history brings a mental challenge and gives deeper and extensive knowledge about that place .to find out the most beautiful but hidden places are unique experiences for me .also , not to follow a tour guide that means not be tied by a incoherent group can give much space for your discovery .you wo nt have rush to follow any schedule or you wo nt wait someone whom is taking your time at all .it may seem harsh thought but i count on my experiences .in sum , i suppose that i am more individiulastic one that led my decision favor of travelling without a tour guide .i like expose and experience freely and myself .
