some people agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , while others agree that it is more important for them to learn facts .although both views are valid to a certain extent , i personally prefer the former view for the following reasons .first and foremost , a student can expand their knowledge by understanding ideas and concepts .for example , when you are solving a math problem , you have to first understand ideas and concepts of the situation to apply the right formula for the question .memorizing the formula does not get you to solve the problem .you first have to understand what question is asking for , and find the right formula to apply for .by solving a problem , you can expand your knowledge of math .second , understanding ideas and concepts can allow students to have right veiws .for example , the holocaust is one of the events that should never be repeated .by understanding what nazism is and understanding the concepts of discrimination , students can have the right views of the event , and the same thing as the holocaust can be prevented by them .fianlly , simply learning facts does not get students understanding skills .of course , it is important to learn facts , because some understandings are based on the facts .however , learning facts does not get students understanding of the ideas or knowing the fundamental concepts .in conclusion , i think it is much more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
