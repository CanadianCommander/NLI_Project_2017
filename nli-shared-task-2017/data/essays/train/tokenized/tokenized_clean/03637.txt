i strongly agree with the statement .most advertisements make products better than they really are .first , advertisements enphatize the quality of their product with catchy slogan : for example it is likely to see a picture of a beautifull woman with the shirt or dress they want to sell taking your attention away from other information .sometimes advertisements give true but incomplete informations : it happens to me with adsl connection .they assured free assistance calling a free number , but when i called that number i heard a recorded voice telling me to call another number with expencive fare .second , they usually do not talk about disadvantages : for example it is easy to observe advertisements about sports car and seldom do they give informations about how much gasoline they need for running one mile or about taxes owner has to pay .in addition , advertisements often do not give any advice about where or when the products can not be used .that is very important in particular if items are medicine or noxious substances .for example it happenened that , after the ii world war , large amount of pesticide ddt against insect was used in agricolture , and many people used it also on his body in order to keep dangerous insect away , in the spite of its toxicity .cocluding , i do not saying advertisements should be banned , however i think that advertisement informations and suggestions from product advertisement should be taken carefully
