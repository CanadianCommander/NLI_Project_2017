the following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .from my point of view there are lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement .for example younger people are usually not that setteled or depending on other persons , which makes you enjoy life more and live freely .in younger years one does nt think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on , such as illnesses or financial security problems .furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway , apart from some learning times .so yes , i would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often more easy to really enjoy life than in older years .but on the other hand i think - and i can only think about it because i am in my younger years at the moment - the older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life .surely they ll do it in a different way because it s not all about parties and having fun , but with a life-experience i am sure one can enjoy life at a different level .looking back on what offered life for you , everything you ve been already able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you ve gone through i think one can enjoy life as much as young people .apart from that i can imagine that a lot experience , which you definitley have as an older person , can give a good measure as well concerning what is really worth to enjoy and what is not .so to bring it up to a point i would nt say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .perhaps both groups enjoy and spend their time in different ways but in total i am sure that both are able to enjoy at a similar level .
