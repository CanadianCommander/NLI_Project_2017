people s personalities differ between each other , and so do their sklls and habits .what one person maybe bad at could be another s field of experties .the human nature drives to explore what is un explored , to experience what is unexperienced .we try new things and take risks every day at home , at work , and among our friends , to find ourselves and to improve our charectors , and that is what create successful people .trying different things improves our charector .you may try different recipes for dinner , recipes you had never tried before , making mixs your self .that , for example , improves your taste and creativity .it makes you experince things you thought never existed .when you choose to start your own business but fear the loss , going on with your plans builds up confidence in you .when you travel by an airplance , eventhough you fear it , that gives you courge .all the choices we make , all the experinces we have builds who we are and defines us .sometimes we are lost , do nt kmow who we are or what we were ment to do and be .whether we were ment to be nba stars or business managers , holloywood star or a priest in a churich .we never know untill we try what we still have not tried .we are defined by what we do and how we do it and if we limit what we have done we will never have the nerve to do what we want to do .we are good at what we already know , but are we at what we never tried ?that is the thin line that differs seccessful people from those who are not .we live in boxes that limit our way of thinking , and unless we relieze it , we will never get to where we want to be , will never achieve what we have always wanted to achieve -- greatness and success .
