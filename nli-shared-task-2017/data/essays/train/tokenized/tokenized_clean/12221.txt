this is a problem , which can not be answered just with `` yes  or `` no  or in a few words .there surely are examples for both : young people who help their communities and who do not .young people who do not give enough time to helping their communities may not be integrated strong enough in this community .maybe their parents have little time due to their jobs or because they do not want to spend much time with their kids .so the kids only do the things they want , meet friends , have fun , but do not think about responsibility .often kids whose parents do not spend enough time for them feel more responsible for their friends than for their parents and the community they come from .a big problem that can occur related to this are gangs .the kids believe that solely their friends are important and they do nt have any responsibility against other parts of the society .but this way they build up a new community and spend much time to helping this community .but other kids are more integrated in the community of the adults .they do much for their village or region .for example they are in a sports club or train in the firefighter s youth-section .i think the major problem is the behaviour of the adults , especially the parents , and how the kids are treated in their community .if young people know that the adults need them and the adults show that they are proud of what the kids do for the community , the young people will spend more time to helping their community .but if the adults do not spend enough time with the kids and maybe their community too , the kids will act the same way .
