i agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because i think that the transportation system such as trains or busses will be developed more than now .even now , in the big citys , people use trains or busses more than cars .maybe people think convinient to use transportations better than using a car because of dense of the people and cars .nobody likes the rush hours and everybody wants to avoid it .the other reason i agree with the statement is the think of environment .it is a serious problem the mount of co2 the bunch of cars make .i guess and i hope that people will care about environment more and for that , using cars is not so good way .if many people use trains of busses instead of cars , much of co2 is reduced .one more last reason i agree with the statement is the cost of the car .to have a car costs much because of gas , insuluence , maintaince , and itself .because of these costs , i think in next twenty years , the number of the people who use the cars will reduce .and also , it is more healthy than cars because it makes peole stand and walk .these are the reasons why i agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .however , of course , there are many good points about cars .it is convinient , useful , and for some people , it s cool to have it .moreover , transportations such as busses and trains also have many problems such as the rush time or times it takes .but for many reasons i said above , i hope the improvement of the transpotation system and i think it will be .
