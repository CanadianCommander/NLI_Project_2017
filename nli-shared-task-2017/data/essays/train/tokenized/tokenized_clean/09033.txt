is the number of cars going to decrease during the next twenty years ?that is a question we have to study according to many points of view .firstable we have to determine if we have enough ressources like petroleum to make our carswork .we do nt have precise figures about that subject .that let us think that producing countries prefer to hide them to make us think that it is not a problem .however the amount of petroleum is still decreasing .that s why we can think that it wil have a bad influence on the number of cars during the next few years .we may escape to this fate thanks to biotechnologies .environmental effort should be made to transform a car into a less pollutant machine .we have to protect the ozon layer .researchers try to create oil thanks to some plants  species .it is an ecological solution to keep a certain amount of car on earth .but we will have to adapt car to this new oil and that cost time , money and need governmental authorisations to make it possible .another aspect which can inflence the number of cars that will be used in twenty years is that every owner has some habits .he uses more or less his car .some people have to take their car each time he has to make shopping , to see other persons .they can do anything else than using their car .researchers has to develop another way to move so that any physical efforts has to be provided .indeed , a man is not going to take his bicycle to replace his car just because of environmental reasons .he will not be enough concerned about that .but if there is another choice to move , i think i will agree to try it .to conclude , i think it will be very difficult to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years mainly because of economical and practical reasons .however , in my opinion , the environmental problem the number of cars causes must make us react to create a less pollutant machine than car .everybody must to keep in mind that the whole planet is in danger and we have to change our behaviour .
