well , enjoying life does nt really depend upon how old we are , provided , one is interested in giving time for oneself and one s joys .in most of the cases , yes , it s true that young people enjoy life better than most of the old people do .one of the reasons why this happens is that , young people generally do nt have much of responsibilities as old people do .a school-going or a college-going girl has only one major responsibility in life .thats is to study .apart from that , she has no tensions and worries , usually .whereas , old people have a lot of responsibilities .older people generally get busy with work and responsibilties concerned with work apart from the responsibities at home .elder people get to manage the family economically also .they need to take care of every family member and their necessities .another important factor that refrains old people from enjoying their lives , going out and partying kind of stuff , is expense involved in these .it would nt be a big problem for a 20 year old guy to spend $ 20 or $ 30 for a movie or spend more in a restaurant or a party .but , old people , as they take the responsibilty of the whole family , do nt generally prefer to spend so much on a so-called `` luxury  but will want to spend that money on some useful item for the house so that everyone is benefitted by their expense .another factor is enthusiasm .old people , usually , are nt as energetic as young people are and so they ca nt spend much time spending much energy in anything .whereas youth are full of energy and spend more time having fun and enjoying than old people do .to conclude , there should be balance in anyone s life .people , irrespective of age or financial status should spend some time having fun and enjoying life than spending most of their lives dedicated to work .
