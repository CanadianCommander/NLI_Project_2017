i do not fullly agree with this statement .undoubtely there are a lot of examples in history providing the statement .one person i think of is albert einstein .he perfomed physics in a time , when the general opinion was , that in physics more or less all has been discovered .but he was in doubt about some facts , which did not seem to be correct for him .by publishing his theory of relativity he risked to loose his reputation in the scientific community , as most of the other scientists declared him to be lunatic .and what has become of is today ?his theory explains a lot of phenomena like the gravitational force and his name is present to nearly everybody in the world .for another example you may think of the american expression ` from a dishwasher to a millionaire  , which states the possibility to become successful in life by trying new ways and hard work .exactly at this point i see a weakness of the statement : hard work .it does not appear in it at all .in my opinion you can be succesful in life without taking unnecessary risks .you might be one of the leading scientists in your special field of interest .lets say you are a specialist in computer databases .why should you take risk and , for example , start a business selling databases , risking bankrupty ?it is possibly a sensible decision to offer your abilties to others which will pay you .perhaps you will not get a second bill gates but you also might become succesfull .another point of critizism of mine is the fact that everybody finds success in different part of life .having a loved family can make feel successful .but i think you should not risk anything at all if your family is involved , because your children might suffer from it .
