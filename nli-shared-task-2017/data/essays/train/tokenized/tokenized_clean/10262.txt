no matter where you go , you ll always be confronted with huge commercial signs .even your favorate television programmes are filled with subtle advertising tricks .the huge amount of commercials and the way in which the products are presented has often made me wonder if the products are truely as amazing as they look .and i often come to the conclusion that most products truely are too good to be true .the advertisements make them better than they really are .first of all , you must keep in mind that the advertisement serve for one purpose and one purpose only and that is selling the product , no matter what .in order to do so , advertisers tend to exaggerate and brag .by telling amazing stories about the products , they try to sell them .of course , nobody wants to buy ordinary products that have no use anyway .besides , there are a lot of products of the same kind in the markets .so there need to be distinction between them .people want to know which one is the best , because everyone wants only the best of the best .and a lot of advertisements do make a product extraordinary .take the commercials for make-up for example .people often tend to buy overprized make-up rather than the cheap ones .that s because they see and hear celebrities talk about those ` amazing  cosmetic products .i m sure you ve seen andie mcdowell starring in the loreal commercials promoting facial cream : `` this will definitely make your rincles dissappear .you ll see instant results !this is the best !it perhaps really is nt the best facial cream , or even different from the other creams , but the celebrity makes it special .finally , modern technology plays a big roll in the scheme .the use of photoshop has made people and products look better and prettier than they really are .it s very easy to manipulate pictures .and the advertisers know that .it s so commonly used nowadays , that you will hardly find any ` natural  pictures anymore .it s always fun to watch the commercials , though .seeing how the companies have outdone themselves again and again .they always find new ways of entertaining the audience , trying to get your attention .having singing children and perfect families playing in the commercials .they re fun to watch , but they re definitely not representative for thso all with all , be very cautious when buying products .do nt buy everything the commercials tell you to buy , as these products are often too good ot be true !remember that these adds are often misleading and exaggerated .the advertisers want you to buy their products and will do anything to get them sold .using modern technology and paying celebrity , they manipulate the public opinion .enjoy the commecials , but do nt let them fool you .
