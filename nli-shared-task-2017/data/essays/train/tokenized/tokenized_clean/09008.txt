i agree with the statement .economic rules changed a lot during the last sixty years .the arrive of television and the expansion of mass medias in general brougth to a different consideration of people forming a society : we re no more considered as a mass of different personalities who must share rules to coexist , but also and very often only as a mass on consumers who have to buy the same products .this brougth to a challenge to convince consumers to buy a certain product instead of another one .to do this , advertisements try to make product seem much better than they really are , and expecially better than the direct challenger .a typical example that comes in my mind referres to the michelin tyres advertisement .all over the world we can see advertisements stating that michelin is the best producer for tyres and where is possible , the advertisement explains that michelin in much better that bridgestone , that is another tyres producer , directly challenging michelin .in the formula1 championship , that is a race car championship , michelin and bridgestone face each other directly , since they are the only producers allowed to build those special kind of tyres that are required for formula 1 .in the 2005 indianapolis formula 1 grand prix , michelin and bridgestone equiped a different number of cars , as always .during the racing weekend , a lot of michelin tyres explosed , and only them : no bridgeston tyres had problems .because of this problem , no cars using michelin tyres could challenge on sunday , during the race .only cars using bridgestone tyres were allowed .that was a perfect example that michelin is not the best tyres producer as the advertisements stated .michelin , after the problems created , had to refund the cost of the tickets to the spectators , paid for the damages occurred to the teams and first of all , had a huge image damage , since every consumer couldt forget what happened that year in indianapolis .
