in this contemporary world it is inevitable to be away from the tecnologigal developments and the facilities the life presents us .one of these is of course the cars whigh make our life easier and time-saving .some say that in twenty years time there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i actually disagree with this opinion because i believe that in this rapid change of the world noone can prevent the surprising innovations to be appeared on this very big stage of earth .thus , some people , such as scientists , manufacturers , governments and the consumers also , wil urgently have to take some precautions as soon as possible ; otherwise the people living on earth can be face to face several harms and disadvantages of having that much of cars where they live .first , there is a very overwhelming problem that must be taken into consideration on global base , that is pollution .too many cars mean too much environmental problem .as a solution to this problem governments should put great importance onto the public trasportation systems .it wo nt merely solve the problem , but it will also be much more econemical at the same time .secondly , perhaps in twent years  time , throughout which noone can be sure about what hi-tec movements se are going to see , people may be using some other ways of transportation instead of having cars .moreover , if this can not happen , there wo nt be even a bit of empty space
