i am a kinds of peason who agree with the oppinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well .the life is one time .therefore , we tends to think that we want to live with calm and happy life .however , i believe that we have to keep challenging .one of my friends ; his name is yu , he is in london now .we used to be classmates when we were in senior high school .since he was a student , he always said that he wanted to work in the united nations .everyone knows it is really hard to work there .however , he has never given up his real dream .after he graduated university in tokyo , he belonged to the government as a member of economy department .then , he decided to go abroad to learn bussiness and economy .after this desition , he kept studying and finally he got a ticket to study abroad as a nation scolarship .now he is in london and studies in bussiness school .after graduation , he is going to back to japan and work for the goverment again , but as a member of international department .then , he is thinking about go to united state and study 2 more years .after all , he is trying to apply to the united nations .this is still a dream , however he is trying new things , even though he should have good salary to keep working in japan .though , i am not sure that who is to be called a successful person , i am thinking i am the one by myself .most of my friends are working in japan .they have kept working since they graduated their univercities ; it has been almost 10 years .they have a carrer now .therefore , some of them became a chief of their groups .however , i have never worked in japan .i am a kindergarten teacher .i used to work in indonesia as a staff of jakarta japanese school .then i came to united state to work as a same kind of jobs but defferent style to teach .sometimes i am warried about myself , because i am still single and i have no carrer in japan .however , i keep doing what i wanted to do .i feel homesick sometimes , hoewver , instead of that , i can meet new friends here in america .they make me encourage and make my mind more challengeable .thus , i think successful people is enjoying their life and very bright , even though it used to be hard .people who can have a challengeship can be a succesful peason .
