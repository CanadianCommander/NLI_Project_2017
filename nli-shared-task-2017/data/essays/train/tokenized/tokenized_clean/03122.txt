i am strongerly agree with the statement .i faced the same problems everyday during studying .students can be more rely on the ideas and the concepts of what we are learing .i will develop three important reason why this statement is true .first , it is more easier to learn ideas and concepts .when we try to learn the facts , it s more harder to understand and it might confused them more and more .also it can bored out the students when we focus on the facts .it might be interesting , and it might help us more .but what is the point if we do nt understand .there is no point to learn about what we need to learn .second , i think that udeas and concepts seems to stay longer than the fact .when we understand the ideas and concepts , it stay in our memory longer , because it interests people more than the fact .i have been taking anatomy class .it was really hard for me to learn something that uncommonly used , but if i applied my concepts or ideas to the definition or the body part , it s certainly helping me to understand what i am doing and also easy for me to memorize .third , it is important to understand what ideas , because that helps me to think more what i am learning and to make me think more and more .thus , learing facts does nt hurt .but to understand ideas and concepts can help students more effective .also this lead them to be more interested what we are learning .
