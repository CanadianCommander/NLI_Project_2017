car as an object of desirei would really wish this stament would turn out to be true but i do not think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .even though there is incredible technologic progressions occur in transportation , sociologic researches have shown us that a car is more than an instrument of transportation .it is an indicator of a social status .although the developping technologies are making our lives more comfortable , still people have cravings for objects of desires , objects of self-satisfaction ; such as cars .it is true that the public transportation devises are improving in each passing day .i remeneber one it was impossible to imagine a train passing through a tunnel which is under the sea .by this invention now people who live in paris can work in london .however when we speak of the transportation within a city , people insist on driving their own cars no matter how disastrous the traffic jam could get in morning hours when everybody is rushing to work .they get in their cars , usually one car for one person , and they prefer to be isolated from public in this safe but burdensome ride with all the traffic jam .i believe this is an egoistic attitude because preffering the public transportation would solve a lot of problems , especially the traffic jam .as i said before the people are stubborn and rigid on not giving up their cars in the sake of the improvement of the traffic conditions .they are concerned about their cars because cars have a significant symbol which underlines the social status of a person .maybe this is a specific case for turkey  in fact for istanbul , i am not sure .the parking is also another huge problem here .there are more private parking lots ( parking lot mafia we call it beacuse they make a lot of money ) than natural parks .every space is considered a parking lot .the parking lots are like galleries in specific places of istanbul .the vallets arrange them in an order where the most expensive cars are displayed with great care .in that way the owner of the car is also happy and tips the man more .when the situation is like that who would give up their cars ?in fact , by the developping technologies new and more luxury cars are produced in each day .advertising companies emphasize the need to change your car to a more advanced model if you really wish to maintain your social status .you need to be updated .who would give up these objects that we fetished ?no way . ..in conclusion , i do not think that the number os the cars in use are going to decrease in twenty years .in fact the demand for luxury cars are going to rise .the use of public transportation devises are going to decline so the problems concerning traffic jam and parking spaces are not going to be solved beacuse a car is more than what it is used for .it has a whole fancy myth behind it to which we are all attracted unconsciously .
