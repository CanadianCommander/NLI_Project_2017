since most people travel to unknown places and most of those beautiful places have some historical o cultural background , i strongly support the idea of traveling guides .in fact , by having guides in any travel we do nt have to worry about where to go or expending much time in only one place .i remember when i went to peru ; i can imagine going there without a peter that was his name .peter is a native person living close to machu-pichu ; at the beggining when he offered his services as aguide , i was not sure of our need opf his help ; but later on i not only new about the importance of him that they , but also the need of his nice service .indeed peter directed us throght a pathway that only natives know ; we were able to see the most wanderful landscape where the incas where living on and also we did nt waste time since peter knew how long it takes for a turist to go aroud the such a wonderful place .furthermore , we were lucky to have them showing us what the place we were visiting were used for , by the incas ; but he gave us a nice speach of history and culture .even people who were born in peru use to have him as a guide or other one ; because they know of the benefit of it .it is also know by turist that some danger could be around when visiting some places ; when you have a guide it is less frequent to get into those troubles , since most guides know very well the place and they will take any step to keep us healthy .for example by that time i read about a tourist from europe who was robed while walking around .another case is one that happended to a lady who had an accident after falling from the hill , she wanted to cut the path way to arrive early but because she did nt know the place she took a wrong way .there are many other examples in my mind not only from this specifically one but much many others .finally , i find very enjoyable meeting people during my travel adventures .and the main person i use to socialize with is a guide .in fact i am a sociologist and my life is all about meeting asll kind of people with different costums and backgrouds , listening to them about their adventures and experiences with other turists .i thing guides are amazing people who get easily along to different people from different cultures .guides also are very educated people .indeed most speak 2 , 3 or more languages .in summary , guides are not only important to have a nice trip , but they make our vacation unforgetable . .they represent other culture and we can get a lot of knowledge from them .i would recommend that any person going in a trip use a guide if they want to have a fun and easy trip anywhere .thanks .
