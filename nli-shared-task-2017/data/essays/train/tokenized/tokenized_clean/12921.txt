the way your are living your life and the vision you have about are obviously changing when you get older .you are not the same when you are 15 than when you are 70 .at the first view , young people enjoy living much more than older .but on the other hand , maybe older people know how to live more intensely than the young .you just have to look out in the street .you will probably see kids playing , crying , hurting , running . ..look better and you will be able to gaze two tenagers kissing each other behind a tree .that is life !these young people are dry from life .they have so much to discover , so many things to try .every moment is a surprise .on the contrary , after long the years spendt on earth , you probably have lived everything , you do not expect a lot of thingd  s from life .and in many cases , the older you are , the more difficult your body to use is .so how enjoy life as much as when you are young ?indeed young people seem to enjoy life more , but is nt it an important advantage to have experience to live better ?young people can not understand how life is precious .they live their lifes as they burn matches .life is just a highway in wich you have to drive the as fast as you can .but this is not enjoying life .it is living in a hurry .when you grow up , your experience help you to deal with problem and more important , to really appreciate the time you spend , for example with other people .when you are young you can not realize how lucky you are .but wiseness comes with the years .and it is when life has really hurt you than you realize this kind of things which allow you to live in a better way and ti enjoy more life .
