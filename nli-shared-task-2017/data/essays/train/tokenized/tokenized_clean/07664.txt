there are several opinions about knowledge of academic subjects .some believe in that people should learn many of the academic topics and some thinks that it is useless to know many of them .according to my opinion , people should have broad knowledge about many academic topics for solving problems , having more information and having options in front of us .the first reason is people can not know what would they meet in the future .knowledge helps for solutions to the problems .for example after graduation of a department , which teaches many academic topics , person could be recruited and in business life that person may meet with lots of problems .as said lectures are preparation for business than they would be the answers to the problems in business life .so these many lectures , that person got in the past , would be different solutions to the problems because every knowledge would have different points of view .secondly specialization on just one specific subject gives us less knowledge .this means that we would have a great knowledge about one topic and it may be seem as not bad .in my opinion this is not true because usually there are lots of information about any subject and i can not believe that a person may learn everything on that subject .although that person may learn most of the information , he/she can not learn all of them .in contrast having knowledge about many topics is more believable because a person can many small things from lots of subject .these examples are from daily life but they are all same with the academic subjects .lastly broad knowledge means options in the life .after specialization , we would have only one chance which limits people and if we want to be free and independent of anything we should not be specialized .for instance if we learn lots from academic subjects , we can easily decide what we will do in the future after seeing all the options lying in front of us .if we take these things above into consideration , i can say that being specific on one topic is not as good enough as having wide information about academic topics .to learn more , we should just study on more topics .
