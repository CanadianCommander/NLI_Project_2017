for several years the price of the gas has been increasing .it had made people change their habits .and because there is no evidence that it will decrease soon , people have started to change their habits .first they are more likely to use common transports than they were in the past .also they use less their cars for small ride .i think this trend will keep going and that year after year , people will use their cars fewer and fewer , only because gas is becoming to expensive .some cities try to encourage their citizens to drop the car .for example in paris , the mayor s policy is to develop the use of public transports and to reduce the use of cars .so for several years , buses have their own lines in the streets to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic , the days of big pollution there are restriction of the vehicules admitted in the streets , and parking  price is cheaper for the resident so their cars do nt move .this policy makes it so difficult to drive in the streets of paris that i assume many people will drop the car either for a bike or a scooter than for public transports .of course people living in the countryside are not concerned by this policy .but other projects , on the national level , try to incite them to buy clean cars , or having a more responsable use .of course this policy is difficult to accept for some people who do not feel concerned about the environmental problems .for the youth such i , protecting the environment is a major issue , we have been taught on this topic since childhood .but for the older , it does nt seem like a real problem such as war , economy or unemployment .so they keep using their cars a lot .in twenty years , when the actual youth we ll be the older , they wo nt be acting like that because of their education .personnaly , i ll use my car as less as possible .
