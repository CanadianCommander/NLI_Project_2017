i strongly agree that the young people nowdays donot give enough time to their communities .young people who are generally considered as the major force , the future of the any nation ironically dont spend much of the time helping the communities .they generally donot raise voices against the injustic , against the activities carried by the malicious minds present in our society .firstly the young people of nowdays are gererally to obessesed by self-needs that they donot tend to think of the society .the term too-selfcentered is the best to describe the young generation of the era .the need of money , the self problems like emotional ones tends to isolate the young people form the community as a whole for example the software graduate are willing to work for long hours in order to earn more money .the greed for money could be for family or for themselves whatever might be the reason he is deprived of his valuable time .the problem can only be solved by the satisfaction in less money not by abudence of it .the solution to the emotional problem is that young peolpe should involve in the family more for the emotional support the more spare time they have the more the involvement is there form the part of the youngesters .the second most important reason is the laws , procedure and policies of the government are as such as the young people tend to think twice before helping and trying to raise the voices in favor of their communities .for example if their is problem regarding the demolishing of the houses of their communities if the young people want to raise their voices they might end up in the jail .this is the result of the flaws of the laws and policies of the government .the solution to the problem is the laws and policies should be such that young people are not scared against helping their community .the less greed for money accompanied with the work-satisfaction & the laws and policies which are not harsh will generally encourage the young peole nowdays to help the communities .
