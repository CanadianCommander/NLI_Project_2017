i agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .although vihecles is the most common traffic tools that we use today , but its should be earsed based on following three shortcomings and situations : fossil , pollution and traffic pressure .as we all know , oil and coal are unrevivable resources .the coal resources can only be used by two hundred years and the oil resources can even be used by fifty years .cars like many other traffic tools are the main consumer of these fossils .since we have not enough resources for the vihecle to keep them work forever , there must be a revolution of the traffic tools in near future .that will give out a new role so as to get rid of the cars from the historic stage .these should happen in twenty years .in additon , the pollution problem is another important issue for today .and the cars are the most monster which caused a lot of air pollution and noise pollution .the cars works by burning the fossil so that they always pour out so much carbin dioxide and much other poison gas .some of them can get together with the water to make acid rain which is the main destroyer of the building and monuments .some of the harmful gas causes warm-room effect in the city so that many plants will be dying in this kind of enviorament .in order to protect our earth , we should project the car !resently , traffic jam is also a question to make headache .this is almost caused by such a great amount of cars we are using .much time is wasted in the jam which would not make any value for the society .if people does nt always drive their own car and take more public traffics , all of them will have more leisure to relax and more chance to make money .as so many cars are not necessary , why they should exist any more , even if everybody recognize this point , cars will not keep a long life on the market .so , as a result , cars will plays more and more little role in our life because of the reasons above .and they are getting disappeared from now on .let s watch the extinction of the car !
