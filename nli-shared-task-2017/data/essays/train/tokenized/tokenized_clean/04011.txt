people say that we prefer to learn facts in the our life .some people also say that learning something without understanding ideas and concepts of the materials are dangerous in the their fields .in my opinion , i think that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts at first , when i was high school , i had to experience to learn my science subject without understanding concepts coming my test .as the result , i was not taken score that i wanted because i had to memorised the subject on purpose such like another students studing their test .however my friend named mathuda had to study his subject in keeping understand the test .in addition if he was not understand any more about science , he tried to struggle to understand the science of the concept .so he won the prize of test .understanding the concept contributies students to konw in the fields more detail .it offers our to have imaginage in our life .it means more effective than learn facts because we need to develop strong skill of our subject in our life .having understand ideas is to establishes to expand our field more .in this manner .i prefer to study understanding ideas and concepts .in conclusion , i agree with above statement .
