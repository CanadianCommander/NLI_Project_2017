i agree with the statement mentioned .beyond every success there is a risk associated with it .if we consider our renowed scientists and researchers , behind their every success there is a risk .they keep on doing risks in finding out new inventions and new discoveries .successful people probably will not wish to do the things which are well known to them because they think in a different way , aiming high to achieve something which is new .in these aspects they do greater risks to find out new things .they are very much dare enough to do any sort of risk in achieving a positive result .for example i consider madam curie to be the most risk taking and a most successful scientist .as she laid path in the discovery of `` radium  , a radio active material she took a greater risk in the discovery of radium .she had done a lot of experiments in finding the radio active material .her experiments involved many risk taking factors in which they are very dangerous .at last she found out the radium after a series of experiments and reasearch .the discovery of radium thus involved many risk factors and atlast she has tasted the success .if she would not had taken the risk means the radium would not have been found till now .in the same way as mentioned above , successful people always try for new things rather than doing the things which are already very well known to them .successful people always try new things and new tasks .its incorporated in them to try for a new one .in this process many scientists have laid path to many inventions such as marconie invented a radio , grahambell invented a telephone and so on .so i conclude the essay by stating that risk must be taken by every individual in achieving success and try out for a new thing rather than doing the thing which is known to us .
