in my opinion , it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .firstly because in today s society , consumption has become a way of life where advertisement has a big impact on consummer s beliefs .what is important currently is not necessarily the taste or the quality of a product .the surprising trend is that people are increasingly affected by the image of the product .and the big companies have understood this trend and take the opportunity to develop their goods by creating solid brands .therefore , they play on the people beliefs and in some cases even cheat on them by arguing with pseudo scientific concepts .for instance , we will probably buy the pack of milk with the metion `` special omega 3  instead of the one with no advertisements .besides that , we have to be conscious that there is no link between the quality of a product and its advertisements .the proof is that it is a totally different company which is in charge of the advertisement .and this last one has often much more money to fund its advertisement than the first one has to make his production .finally i think that it is very dangerous today not to take enough into consideration the way goods are producted .some balls are for example made by poor indian children we are not aware of .and they will become high quality balls as soon as a brand will be written on it .
