there can be found several reasons to think that younger people enjoy life mor ethan young ones as well as to proof the opposite .however it is fianlly up to the individual environment a person is born into as well as his personal approach towards life .young people , provided that they grow up in an intact environment generally enjoy their lives because they are not burdened with the sorrows , experiences and responsibilities older people have .they do not have to bother about money or looking after a family , nor are they usually held liable for the ( wrong or stupid ) things they do .in contrast , a grown up has lots of resonsibilities and things to worry about , which might leave him less time to enjoy life .having said that , it is a fact that older people , who have left their family and started to work and becoem responsible for their own life have more ( economic ) freedom in what they want to do .they might have the money to fulfill their dreams and therefore enjoy their lives more than somebody dependant on his parents to sponsor them .children usually have to obey their parents and usually are limited in the way they live their livesin normal circumstances kids will have a lot of spare time .consider the long summer and winter holidays and the afternoons left to their own use after homework is done .in adult life work or other responsibilities as family will ake most a persons daytime and leave less time for leisure .however , after retirement older people may have again more time available and therefore do things they enjoy .in general young people will be healthier and fitter than older people .older people tend to hav emonir or even mor serious health problems keeping them from doing whatever they wish to do .depending on their mentality some older people value the positiv esides of life even more when they are old , because they know how hard life can be .this is something young people lacking experience will not be able to .there are a lot arguments in favor of young people enjoing their lives mor than older ones and there are several ones which support the idea that older people tend to enjoy life more .in my opinion this question is decided mainly on the given environment of a person and his personal approach to joy .
