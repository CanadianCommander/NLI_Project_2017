generally speaking , there are various types of people in this diverse society .some people tend to risk in order to become a successful man in the world , while others are afraid of risking and trying new things because they worried about losing their money and possesions .but personally , i agree people should try and risk new things in order to be a successful and well-know person for the following reasons .most importantly , people who like to try new things tend to have more possibilies to success .in other words , they might find out something that they are very good at and start to do other things they are talented .to give a personal example , two years ago , when i was in saint andrew-sewanee school , a very small private school in tennessee .i took calculus course , which was extremly hard and i thought i would do terrible on that semester , as oppsed to get an a on it .however , after i tried to study several times , i found out it was not as difficult as i imagined .i studied hard and got an a on every quizes and tests .needless to say , my semester grade was an a. consequently , i started to have interests examing the math world beyond calculus .now , i successfully become an expert of math due to the fact that i took risks to take calculus two years ago .in addition , people would more likely to learn the old experience and invent something great by trying the new things .if you keep trying new things , you would learn the experience why the old methods is not working and would find out the new method that would make it work by continuing to try .for instance , edison , a great inventor in the united states , invented a substance called `` light ,  which is one of the useful and neccessary items in the world nowadays .during his experiment , he had failed to find the correct metals that would make a substance lighten .however , he did not just five up .instead , he kept trying new trails and new metals thousands of times .and eventually , he invented light .this is a good example that people would likely to be successful by trying new things .ultimately , some people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , whereas others would rather try new things and take risks .of course , i sometimes would review what i already know .but most of the time , i always like to try something that are unfamiliar to me .
