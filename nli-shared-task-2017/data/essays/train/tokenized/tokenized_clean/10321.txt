a very famous saying goes as `` be best at what you do  .having excelled in a particular is more beneficial than having surface knowledge about many subjects .we will only be respected if we excel in our chosen field .my first example will be from our academic life .even our education system follows the aproach mentioned above .as we reach eleventh standard we are asked to make choice from many subjects because it is really important that we concentrate our mind one particular field .at the college level we further need to determine in which subjects we want to do detailed study .this makes our field of study narrower so that we put the best of our efforts in one particular thing we want to pursue .my next example is from our social life .in a group discussion we should be adept at one topic about the issue in consideration rather than guessing little about each topic .arguing with people who have expertised in the similar area also increases our knowledge .another example is from the world of science .while doing the research work scientists do not need to know something about every subject but complete knowledge about what they are researching .this is even true for lawyers .fighting a case in a court does not require you to have knowledge about how atoms divide but eveything related to law .trying to know about every subject wll lead us to nowhere .therefore in light of the examples mentioned above i conclude that it is better to specialize in one specific subjct than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
