whether people are better to have broad knowledge of various academic topics or to focus on a specific subject is a controversial issue .on the one hand , gaining specific knowledge means that i might be able to discuss only this subject , but can argue deeply .on the other hand , obtaining broad knowledge means that i can disscuss a variey of topics with different people .however , in the final analysis , i agree with the former statement for the following reasons .for one thing , concentrating one subject can deepen my knowledge , thereby i am able to become a specialist of this subject .compared to a generalist , a specialist is much more demand in the job-hunting-world .one example illustrates my points is that , when i undertook a job hunting , i had a bitter experience on it due to my major , social science .however , one of my friend , marketing major , had many offer from variety companies .based on my experience , focusing on a specific subject lead a successful businessperson today .additionally , obtaining one special knowledge can be unique strength which others are unlikely to have .in our society , it is better that each person has each strengh .if people have same statement about many topic , it is goint to be boring .therefore , considering all of the above factors , gaining specific knowledge is much more effective than learning broad subjects .
