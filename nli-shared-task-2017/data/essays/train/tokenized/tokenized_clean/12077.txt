consumer goods is a big sector in today s markets .there has been a lot of competition among numerous firms in the stage of persuading customers to consume products of firms .as an effective strategy , most corporations make use of advertising to attract customers  attention .though attention span of cutomers is limited since many advertising techniques are used ranging from realistic ones to unrealistic ones .it is obvious and necessary that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because this is a highly competitive business , and attracting attention of people on regular products is difficult goal to manage .it not our issue to argue that population growth in the world or , maybe , globalization caused the markets to be overcrowded .there is this fact lying on the floor and causing firms to compete harshly in an environment where the fittest survive .small firms or the firms that are unable to cope with the competitive environment are omitted or forced to leave the arena .the firms survived were not necessarily the big ones but the clever ones to adopt strategies to sell their products such as pampering the qualities of a product in the ads .this method has proven its efficiency since we observe the products in advertisements lacking realistic representations .in addition to competitiveness of the industry , it is also hard to come up with modifications that would differentiate the product from the competitor products .not only existing technology of the corporation may not permit such a modification , but also the outstanding budget may restrain the company .in those situations , the most cost effective strategy is to use advertising that would put a magnifying glass on customers  eyes .playing with the colors , size , shape would help the customer to realize the product that is on the market .throughout their monotonous lives people neglect many items that is shown to them .by doing so , advertisers are taking advantage of cognitive psychology and even widen the attention span of customers .given the conditions such as lacking technology and inefficient budget , in addition to highly competitive market , it would be fair to use such a hint which would compensate for the conditions .in conclusion , most advertisements most of whom managed to survive , make products less realistic which is an efficient and common method followed in advertising sector .by doing so  they keep on with the market and increase the porfolio of their customers which i would advise to every other entity in the market .
