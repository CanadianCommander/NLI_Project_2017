the controvery , if successful people who try new things and take risks rather than people who only do what the know is an interesting one .i agree with the idea that innovation and taking risks will rather lead to succsess than on remaining your knowledge you already have .think of the world of computing :+ a company which invest a lot of efford in research ( computers ) and new ideas will probably introduce innovative products .the customers are attracted to new features , the new product will pushed away the old one .+ moreover , a company is be able to gain a higher price for its new product , because it has more functions or is better to use , you can ask for a higher price .that will lead to bigger economical succsess .+ when you have new ideas , you are always one step ahead , you are better prepared for future events .someone who is doing only the things he already performs , he can react only .think of car-makers such as chrysler cooperation in the us-market .they sell big suv s , which need a lot of fuel .toyota introduced a new generation of hybrid-vehicles .their cars are quite succsessful in the market , environment-frindy cars became popular .daimlerchryler instead had to close whole plants because no one want to buy their gas-guzzling cars .and this is just the beginning .the change of climate on earth is just to begin to change .people are going to change their mind sometimes , and you are better of if you have new and better ideas for the future .this leads to the idea that if a person ( or a company ) , who is not dealing with future events , tries new ideas and takes risks , will never be succsessful in the future .as a summary i would say that new ideas are an investment in future growth .
