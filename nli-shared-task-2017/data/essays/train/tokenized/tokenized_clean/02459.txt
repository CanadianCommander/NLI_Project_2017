everyone learns a lot of facts in life .the humans learn the whole life and are always improving ways to get a larger knowledge .while studing everyone should decide about the level of deepness about a certain academic subject .the knowlege could be useful , but a lot of times it happens that it does nt have any purposes in real life .for some academics it is important to learn a huge amount of knowledge and it is easier for them to get an overview of information while making a decision .these people need jobs with the task like combining different aspects for a certain problem .for instance , a manager who has to check out all kind of consequences for a problem .a basis for thst is to have a broad knowledge for finding the best solution for the problem .another example could be a doctor who cares forr general sicknesses .he has to know about serveral looks of deseases to offer a quick help in a proper way .sometimes it is also important to have a specialist on a certain subject who is able to solve the problem faster than someone who has just an general idea of the subject .for instance , a doctor in a hospital which is specialisted on cancer .he would be able to help with a professional look at some cells without reading in a book first or fulfilling some experiments .both ways of studing are goog ways to find a profession , because in reality either way is nessecary .it depends on the subject and the profession .for me it would be more interesting to have a large amout of knowledge and to get in touch with different fields of academic subjects .to combine different ideas , aspects and theories sounds very motivating .for sure , with a broad knowledge you could never be a specialist , but you are better in finding a solution by attracting more than one circumstance .
