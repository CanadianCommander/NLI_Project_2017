there have always been arguments or complains about the behaviours of young generations among the older generations , it is an historical attitude of human in all periods of time .so the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities looks like a cliche and i do not agree with it .there are some reasons for my argument .first , the statement seems to me like a cliche because when my mother is making such kind of complains , she says that her mother was also making similar complains to her .furthermore i have read an article about this topic and it is stated that in the writings of ancient civilizations there were complains about younger generations .what i mean that , the reason of such statement is the fight between generations .second , we have to look at what does it mean helping community ?i thing it depends on the time .for example , in the time of second world war , working in a hospital as a volunteer meant helping community .from another perspective , children of a farmer can help their father in field so they may at the same time be helpful for the comunity .however , for the time being , young people are able to contribute their society throug sitting before the computer for hours .the activity has change by the time by it has always been the young generations who come up with the new ideas that lead to developments .as a result , we are live in a global world the most important aspect of which is information revolution .quality of work in many areas depends on brain force not on the muscle force .people can work in their home with their personal computer and achieve much more things then before in a short time .by the same token , young people are also follow these developments .they learn many realities of the world and develop ideas for their solution by searcing in internet in a very short time .it is not necessary any more to participate some kind of socially responsible clups , be aware of realities of world and develop an attitude .there is short ways of doing everything including helping society .
