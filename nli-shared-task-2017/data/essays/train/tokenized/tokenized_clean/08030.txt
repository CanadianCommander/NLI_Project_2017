the gap between young and old people is a kind of discrimination , which effects are increasing in our modern societies .recently , the drought in france revealed a critical issue , by causing the death of old and lonely people .although explanations can be found to justify this statement , i believe that only the physical body is getting older while the soul could last ever .if we tend to define what is enjoying life , people would try to record happy memories .young people carry projects and dream about conquests .the old people have the nostalgy of their youth and will help justify such a statement .being young is the time for first times and it happens once . ..categorizations are dangerous .what happens after the limit is crossed ?when does a person begin to be unhappy ?after a certain time they are put outside of society : loss of a professionnal status , difficulty created due to medical care needs .other cultures , puts the old people on the top of a pyramidal hierarchy in a society , ours could soon bring as a conclusion , that if being old is being unhappy , we could shorten lives by euthanasy .unhappy old people is the easy answer to the fear of getting old and to death .
