some people claim that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .however , i hold a opposing view due to the following resons :first , gaining in-deth knowledge on many academic subjects would be extremely time consuming .studying many different kind of subjects requires the students to spend a lot of time and effort in it .in this way , the students can only learn some superficial knowledge about each subjects but can not really have a very in-depth understandings of the subjects .on the other hand , studying one specific subject can allow you to specialize in it and acquire thorough and in-depth knowledge about the subject .in addition , many careers are specialists and thus require the specific knowledge of that particular subject .for example , being a lawyer you need to have specific knowledge about the law terms , the judiciary system and the judiciary situation of the place you want to work in .you can not enter those specific careers unless you specialize and acquire in-depth knowlegde about that academic subject .last but not least , having specialized in one specific subject can offer you chance to investigate the field which is not touched by people before .you can hardly discover new things or findings in your study unless you have in-death and specific knowledge in that particular subject .for example , if you want to pose a revolution in astronomy study , you need to specialize yourself in it , spending lots of time and efforts in it or else it would be impossible for you to make any revolutionary findings .one can see that the previous scientists who triggered off scientific revolution are those who spent their life time in the study of science .to conclude , i believe that specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge on many different subjects but with superficial knowledges only .
