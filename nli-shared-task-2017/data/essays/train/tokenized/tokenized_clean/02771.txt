this is a difficult and very interesting important statement .in order to answer the question we have to consider the advantages and disadvantages of cars and we have to diucuss the attitude of the people in view of cars , traffic , air pollution . ..on the on hand i do not agree with the statement .everyone has a car , the people live longer than today and so there will be more driving-people .another reason is that a car is nothing special - fifty years ago a car was something unbelieveble - it was a wonder and only a few people were able to have a car .only a few people were able to buty a car or had the driver licence .at the moment most people have the driver license and it is easy to have a car without much money .there are many possibillities to get a car without earning much money , for exemple by pating step by step or by renting a car - and i think this facts will be increase in the next years and will be much stronger than today .but on the other hand i agree with this statement , and i hope it will be correct - this would be very very important for us , our body our healthy our nature and our planet !!!fistly i think that the people are more sensible with our nature .we all know that there are many problems caused by us .the problems increase day by day and and the people are more heaten with ithem than twenty years ago , and i think in twenty years they will care more than today .they will not take the car unneccessary , such as driving from one shop to the other , they will walk more .another exemple is to drive allone - they will meet their job friends anb drive together , this will be cheaper .secondly the communities helps to reduce cars .in is very difficult to find a parking place in the city - so it would be much better to drive by bus .finally the governement helps to reduce the cars with the very very high taxes for having a car , for driving a car and for the gas .to sum up i can say there are many reasons for reducing the amount of cars .and personally i belive that all people are interestet in our nature and healthy , so that the number of cars will gradually discrease .
