in our modern societies , individualism keeps growing .because of this fact , the communities need more and more help .but nowadays , the generation of video games seems more preoccupied by itself than by their commuunities .does it mean than young people do not help their communities anymore ?in a first part , we will discuss the growing individualism , and in the first part , we will see how young people help their communities .to begin with , we live in societies led by capitalism .this system encourages the personal achievement , through the american model of the self-made man .everyone has to fight for himself to realize his dreams , while at the same time , old or handicaped people , or even the family are alone , or in a bad situation .so , should young people sacrified time they would have put into their career to help these communities or not ?however , our societies are also the societies of all the associations .in the last decades , many associations are born , living to help the communities .and it is often young people that work in them .for instance , the association habitat et humanisme that help people to find a house by gathering funds is mainly composed by young people .furthermore , more and more schools and universities develop associations that help people .helping communities has become a common fact for students .i also think that giving time to helping communities becomes more and more a strong argument in front of a manager , when a young people is looking for a job .to conclude , i would say that i clearly disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping communities .in the contrary , i think they give more and more time for them .
