in general , i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .however , i am not convinced that it is not neccessary to learn facts also .on one hand , it is very important for students to understand the basic idea of different phenomenon .with this it will be much easier to learn new things and solve problems much more effective .the needed facts one can review later in a lot of books .on the other hand , for solving a problem one will need always a lot of facts and while working in a company , one will be always under time pressure .therefore an employee with a lack of already known solutions , will need much more time for solving a given problem , while spending time in reading books .moreover it is possible that he will find an already known answer for the task .for example , when one have to invent something new , the first point is always a patent research .mostly one will find a already known proper solution .as a scientific assistent at the faculty of mechanical engineering i met many times problems while researching on a specific topic .my experiences are , that in 98 percent i can solve these problems only with the actual state of the art and only in 2 percent i need to invent something new .moreover i wrote a lot of exams in which i had known all basics , but , i was not able to calculate a giving machine , as i had not known specific facts .according to this , i am advising the students in my classes of thermodynamic to have an careful look to the different processes given as an example in the book .when they will write the examen at the end of the semesters , it is possible that one of this processes have to been calculated .
