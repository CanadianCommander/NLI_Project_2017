is a broader knowledge going to increase once perspectives in business and life ?let us think about a child in school at the age of 15 .in this case i would recomment that a child has to learn a wide range of subjects in order to become more intelligent and recieve a good knowlege from his school .but regarding a young person , at the age of 16 or above , who would like to go to university it seems neccessary for me that students get a deeper knowledge about one specific field .as everyone knows everyone is individual and has different interests in different subjects .in regard to that : how can someone who does not like or is even not familiar to biology study this subject ?in addition to that our environment needs people who have deep knowledges , for example in the pharma industry .only these people are able to create new medicines to help people with difficult diseases .it is necessary that these persons are well informed about what they are doing otherwise it is a very risky operation .further more there could hardly be any competiton in our busines life if everyone has the same education without any specialization .how could employees decide whether a person is suited or not for a job which expects deeper knowledge ?and what about a person who is interested in maths , but this is the only thing this person is able to do ?it would get lost in the big competition and would never have any chances in improving his unique skill .as a conclusion i can say that specification is the only way to improve a persons skills and to keep competition alife .people need specification as otherwise the unity and importace of a person would get lost and as a result of that one person would be unsatisfied , sad and helpless .
