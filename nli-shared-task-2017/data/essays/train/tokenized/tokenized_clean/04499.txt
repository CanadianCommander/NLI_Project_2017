well , i have several reasons to believe that the amont of cars is even gonna increase .first reason for it s how important cars are for us nowadays .i think cars have really got in our way if life , ( as tv did at its time or cell phones just did ) , modificating deeply transportations and the way humans are moving , so i really wonder what could supply cars .there are even families who have two or three !i think the end of all this will be one car per person , maybe smallers , but increasing in amonts in the cities , never decreasing . ..another fact that it s really important to take into account is the prices of cars .new markets , as the assian one , are offering good cars with lower and lower prices .to have a car is not anymore something that shows luxure , every family can really have at least one , and if prices keep going down , people are gonna bye more , and that once more means more cars in the future .policies are also important .it s true that , some cities have started to restrict the amont of cars allowed to go by the city , but i do nt think they are enought nor good .there is not a real restrinction for cars in cities , and in my opinion , non mayor would forbid them seriously because people woul d vote him anymore , to forbid things is never really wellcome . ..finally , i do nt thing the lack of fuel will be a problem .maybe , there will arrive a day where the fuel will be really expensive , right , but that s not mean that there will be less car driving in ours cities .i guess there will some other energy which will sustitute the fuel , so what will maybe change would be the way in which ours cars are working , but not cars themself .besides , all experts say ( if they are not lying ) , that there is still fuel enough for sixty years over .so in twenty years , cars are gonna keep being the main way to move for humans , and there will be even more , from my point of view .i would love to think the opposite ( because i do not like cars at all ) , but i m rerally pesimist in this field .
