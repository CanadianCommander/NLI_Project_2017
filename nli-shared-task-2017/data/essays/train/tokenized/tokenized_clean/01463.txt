according to a friend of mine , the main difference between the french academic system and american one s is about the knowledge .indeed , the french prefers to study a lot of subjects until university whereas americans have the possibility to choose the specialisation quite quickly .in my opinion , to be specialized in one specific subject can be really interesting .actually , the person is really performant and it can be benefits for the firm .and sometimes , this specific subjct is really difficult and searched .this job can worth a lot of money !however , i definitly prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic .first of all , we know many more informations about the world and it could be helpful to have an overview .then , for a future job , it could be better to know several things and choose the one where i am the best .moreover , if , i quit my job for differents reasons ( employmemts , personal problem . .. )i will be happy to have others qualifications in my resume .for instance , actually , i am in a business school and we learn manys things .when i chose my subjects i chose a third language , italien .i really think that , in the future , it will be better to understand 3 languages instead of only one !i will give you another exemple .if you have an ability , that is good !but do nt lay on it !in this world , there qre so many things intersting , if we had the chance to study let s do it !that is the best opportunity in life !to sum up , the specialization is great but having a broading knowledge give us the best chance in life for our future carriers !
