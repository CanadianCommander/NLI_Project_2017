i definitely agree with this statement !everyday government uses different measures and tries to involve people in the pollution problem that our planet faces at the moment .there are two types of measures that the government uses to discourage people to use their cars so as to fight with the pollution .on the one hand , ` green  or social values get more and more important to the society and are stressed in newspapers and advertising .for instance in my city we can often see advertisings for using public transport instead of your own car .in addition to this type of communication , the city of lyon introduced a new concept of moving from one point to another by using bicycles .this company is called velov and allows people to borrow a bicycle for a certain amount of time practically for free !the subsciption fee is about 5 euros per year which is very tempting !on the other hand , government puts barriers to the use of the car in the city center by fixing entry fees or by making parking fees very high .for example in london you have to paye 8 pounds to get to the city of london !and also you have to paye again when you want to drive back home .this measure has encouraged many english people to use trains or underground , but also helped to decrease the traffic problems and the air pollution in the city .from all these statements and examples we can draw a conclusion .i think the government is really concerned about ecological problems of our planet and use all kind of measures to encourage people to use their cars less .as for me , i definitely agree with these policy and hope that in twenty years we could slow down the air pollution problem .
