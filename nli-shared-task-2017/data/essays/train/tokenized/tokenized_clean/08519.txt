only those who take risks will be the successfull ones .that is what one of my professors in spanish economy in my university in my university used to repeteadly say in class .he wanted us to be adventured , to have the courage to start up new bussineses and , basically , to take the risk to do something different .of course not everybody in class agreed with him , as such way of thinking and living has defenetely pros and cons , but in my oppinion being brave and taking risks in life is important in order to find true happiness and be succesfull .as previously stated , some of my colleagues in class did not agree at all with the professors idea that taking risks is something necessary .they advocated that people should only do what they feel comfortable doing and what they are sure they are going to do well .therefore , not taking risks would somehow ensure your own happiness or sucess .it is true , they would argue , that it might not be the higher level of happines that you would be able to reach , but you make sure you are not going to fail in life .this was infact the particular argument of one of my colleagues , who just wanted to graduate in order to apply for a job in a public ministry and work there for the rest of her life .i thought that it was certainly a safe decission , as she would never have to worry about loosin her job , but in my oppinion she would also renounce to her chances of achieving some higher professional goals .on the other hand , some other colleagues used to say that taking risks is something very important in life , specially when it comes to the economic sector , in which only those who are brave and not follow the rules are really succesfull and acomplish their goals .from my perspective , a key allegation to support this argument is the fact that important business leaders around the globe are people who took risks at some point in their lifes , something which gives a lot of food for thought .in a nutshell , having the courage to take risks is not something easy as of course there is a chance that you might not succeed , but the idea of always doing what is secured and not being able to find and try new things is not atractive to me .i believe that my professor was right and that , in particular in economics , taking risks is what makes the difference .
