`` young people nowadays  , this is a dangerous expression to start a thesis .it carries a negative tone , a musty `` in my days people knew how to behave ...  flavour , older than ancient greece .it is hard not to disagree with anything starting that way .refering to the statement as such , one has to differenciate .there are a lot of young people engaged in activities dentrimental to society .this certainly should change .and there is never enough time spent in helping the community , most social organisation are working at the very limits of their resources and barely scratching the surface of the problems they try to remedy .but that is true for all age groups .furthermore social engagement is not considered very `` cool  by most young people .but there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport groups , boy scouts or christian ( or any other religion ) youth organisations wo nt work without the time and efforts devoted by teenagers and people in their early twenties .so i think the main problem is to recruit more people into social engagement , regardless of their age .society has to change it s attitude towards helping the community to achieve this , not just the young generations .therefore i do not agree with the statement as stated above .
