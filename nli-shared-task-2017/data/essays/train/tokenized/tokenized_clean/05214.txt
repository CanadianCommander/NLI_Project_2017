i feel that in twenty yeras number of cars used will be much more than the ones that are being used today .there are several reasons that i can think of to support this view such as : increase in population , more dependence on alternate fuels , competitve pricing by the car manufactures .the populatin of the world has been increasing in exponential proportions over the past few decades and i do not think this trend would change much in the next two decades .with the increase in population the number of people using personal vehichels would also increase and thus this would increase the number of cars purchsed and used .even though the increase in the comertial fuel prices might deter the people from using cars , of late we have seen a concious effort made by the govetnments in varios countries to use natural fuels like bio-diesel which would mean that thefuprice will be taken care of .even the electric vechicles woul serve this purpose .with the increasing globalisation the car manufactures would be competing with each others to sell their cars and this might result in competitive pricing .competive pricing will lower the car sales and thus encourage the people to buy the cars .the increasing number of car fianancer woul enhance the sales .with most of the govrnments laying emphasis on infrastructue development , the new roads and flyovers would help reduce the traffic congestion to a large extent .moreover this world is becoming so materialistic that i guess we would have to see a major calamity resulting due to the damages caused by the pollution berfore the governments would place mre stringent laws in order to retrict the number of car sales .even if laws are passed to limit the sales of cars it would take a long time before the state could provide adequate public transport serve the entire population .hence because of the above reasons i feel the number of cars would only increase over coming few decades .
