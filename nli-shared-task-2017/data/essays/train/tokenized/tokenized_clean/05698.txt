advertisements as a part of systemi surely agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .however this is not simply caused by advertisements .it is also related to the capitalist system and marx s idea of commodity fetishism .by those processes , peole easily see those things more beautiful then they actually are .first of all i want to describe the basic consequences of commodity fetishism .people by caring more about the exchange values of commodities instead of their use value , get integrated to the system .marx argues that by this way people are controlled by commodities that they actually had created .i think this is the basic feature which underlies why and how advertisements make products seem much better .if people were not a part of the system and were not controlled by the commodities , they would nt be buying things that actually do not need .however by living in the system they do nt care for the real features and use values of things .a person who really and only cares about the use value of a product would nt be atrracted by the commodities which are now seem much better than they actually are .advertisement can give them more value because the system allows simple products to act as they have a real value independent from people .if those conditions were not available , no matter how good or succesfull an advertisement is , it could nt show a product much better .because without those conditions there would nt be a human consciousness which would perceive them better than they are .if only the use value could be cared by people advertisements would even not be on stage .so when i say that i surely agree with the assumption it is because of those underlying features .for commodities to control people , the system needs the advertisements in order to manipulate people more effectively .so as the system is still exercised and work properly all of its parts should also be working properly .and as the advertisement is a part of the system , it has also make its jobs and show products better than they really are .
