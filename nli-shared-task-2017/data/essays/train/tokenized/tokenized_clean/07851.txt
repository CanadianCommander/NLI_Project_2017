in my opinion , the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  is absolutely true .it may depend on the product , how much influence the advertising campaigns have - but for most products in consumer markets it is true .let s have a look at an example : there s a commercial for chocolate on german television .that chocolate is delivered in golden paper and is a litte bit more expensive than all the other available products .now what would be an appropriate commercial for that product ?right - a man looking like james bond , having a party in the back garden of his huge expensive house and beeing accompanied by beautiful young girls .and that s exactly what that whole advertising campaign is like .but why does it have to be like that ?no one would want to buy that product if they saw ordinary people - for instance an elderly couple sitting on their couch - on television , eating that chocolate .as stated above , it s nearly the same with all kind of consumer products : computers , cars , beer , even razor blades or tooth paste .to be honest - nearly all kind of razors blades are the same , there is no unique selling proposition .so the companies use the advertisements to make the difference .you can see a well shaped guy shaving his mustache and his young girl friend watching him .or they tell you that the new wilkinson shaver has now four razor blades instead of three .the commercial on tv tells you , that you must have that shaver because it has four razors - no need to prove that it s really an advantage to have four razors instead of three .what s used to make those products much better than they actually are are emotions .that specific beer shown on tv must taste better than the others - you are like those wild guys who are having fun in the commercial .since that new suv is standing on the top of a big hill in that advert , it must be better than the old model that you re driving at the moment .may be - may be not !but the fact that you see that certain picture produces desire for that product .even when the suv shown on the picture is nt any better at all - it looks much better than all the others do .and that s exactly why most companies make their products appear much better in advertisements than they are in reality : it s working !
