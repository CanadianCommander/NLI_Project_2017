when a young men grows helping other people , he will do the same thing during the adulthood .it is an important thing that consent to value how a person is good or bad .in modern society is truly difficult to find a young with a non-selfish attitude .but the problem does not depends from the young , but depends by the way his parents have educaded him .this is a big problem that in the future will carry us in a much more egoistic society .if a father does nt play often with his child , if he gives only money to his boy , he does nt teach anything to his boy , and the boy will grow up without a guide .the boy will grow only with the importance of material thing , not human values .instead if parents take care about her child s education , and show him how to live with simple things , with real human values , and showing how they help their communities , probably the child will do the same thing in the future .so we have to give a better education to our child , with more simple and human value , not material .only proceding in this way we will have a better society .
