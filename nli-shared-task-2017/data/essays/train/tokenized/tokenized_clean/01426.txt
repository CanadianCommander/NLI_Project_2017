in the world , we can see many advertisements appeared on the television , magazine , radio , and newspaper .when people saw the advertisements on the tv , magazine , radio or newspaper , we can saw the color is more beautiful than the products is .also it can let many people to know the product and to buy it , but people do nt know the product is good or bad .first of all , it can makes products more beautiful than before , but this is not the true color , it can let people make mistake about the color .if i saw clothes on the tv , maybe sometimes i feel happy that the color is very nice .i know , some worker use light or computer to make it .we can choice the best color and let it appear on tv .so , the first thing is make the color more beautiful .second , i think it can make something better than the product really is .for example , we usually see a second hand car on a tv andt sale it .if people see the car just on the computer or tv .we ca nt buy that .some cars is a lemon .we need to go to the place and try to drive it .you can know the car is good or bad only through experiment .so , advertisements make car much better than the really is .third reason is that can let many people to know and buy it .some drinks or food made advertisements , we saw the drinks and food are delicious , but the company did nt say they include how much fat .some food is not helpful for people s health .company s purpose is many people to buy the products .so , they just say good things for people .finally , i say i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i hope people who wants to buy something to go to that place and make sure that things is you want to buy .
