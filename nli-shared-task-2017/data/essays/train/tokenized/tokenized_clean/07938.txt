i agree with the given statement .let us first define what `` fact  means .fact is one which is universallly accepted and which does not have a solid reason for its belief .for e.g. a day has 24 hours , or the month august was named after augustus , and so on .now these are facts which are accepted by all .the standout difference between a fact and concepts is : `` a fact is learned and a concept understood  .to illustrate this let us take another example ; it is a well known `` fact  that a gravitational force acts on each object .but to understand the reason for this fact we net to understand the concept of gravity .on similar lines it is a fact that the earth revolves round the sun .but why ?this can be answered after studying and understanding the ideas and concepts involved in the structure of the solar system .so we see that a fact is easier to locate and find but it is difficult to understand the reasons for the said fact .therefore , a student should focus on the ideaology and conepts involved in the occurance of a fact .facts are the more obvious mundane things , things we come to know with time , but never get a chance to analsye the reasons for them .so , a student should be provided with an opportunity to understand the concepts involved , if any , behind the facts .moreover , the basic aim of studies is not only teaching the facts but more importantly providing the understandings of those facts .
