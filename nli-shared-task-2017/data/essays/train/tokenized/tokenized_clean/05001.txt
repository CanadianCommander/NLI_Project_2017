i agree the statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only donig what they already know how to do well .some people say successful people tend to be conservertive and not to change the environment because they do not want to lose the things they already have .however , i do not agree these kind of opinion thorugh my own experiences meeting successful peeple and reading books about successful people .for example , one of my father s friends , who he was very successful as being cfo in the largest advertising company in japan , started running the organic food restaurant for elder people after retireing his job .another example , some famous japanese traditional dancing artist started her own international trading company which introduces japanese traditional gadgets to the uk .though she had no experience and knowledge about business .i think there are three common chacteristics in successful people .first , they are always interested in and want to know the new information and intelligence he or she have never touched .second , they think one of the important objectives in their life is to meet and make friends with a lot of people as many as they can .third , they think progress and inovation is the only way they keep their success .i think almost all the successful people i know hold these common characteristics and these points make successful people more powerful and attractive .in concequence of this circulation , successful people want to find some new challenges even though they have to take risks .therefore , i think successful people may want to try new things and enter new environments to find new opportunites to make them more successful .
