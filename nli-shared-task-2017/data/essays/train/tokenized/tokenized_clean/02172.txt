i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn them .when a student is taught ideas and concepts it helps him develop his own understanding and gives him the power to analyse differences in two given situations .a student who has learnt the concepts properly can apply these and thus come out with a solution on his own .so what this does is , it promotes and drives the student to grow as an individual intellectually .now consider the case that the student is given all the facts .he will have all the knowledge that he needs to solve a particular problem or he will have all the answers to any question that is thrown at him .since he has learnt these facts , its easier for him to recall them whenever he needs to .this is where the comparasion of the two practices is required to ultimately determine which is more desirable or which one is more beneficial to the student .while knowing all the facts can be considered an asset , not knowing how and where to use them to achieve the desired goal , means that all the factual knowledge is wasted .in such cases the understanding of ideas and concepts is more beneficial as the student will know how to use the information he has or can comprehend from a given situation or example and still come up with a solution .for example i am taught in a phychology class that an individual when scared , acts in a particular way , i will learn that as a fact and the way i need to respond to that will also be learnt .now suppose the person for some reason , choses to act differently and takes me by surprise , since a response for this has not been learnt .so every fact is not useful , the understanding of the concepts of behaviour in this kind of a situation is more advantageous and can help effectively deal with such a situation .so i feel it is more important for a student to understand rather than learn everything he can because things learnt may be forgotten but if the student still has his concepts right , he can still deal with anything .
