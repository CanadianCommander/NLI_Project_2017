i think the best way to travel for the first time to an unknown place is to be in a group lead by a tour guide because of their experience , their knowledge about all important turistics sites and how easilly he can move between the cities , places and small villages you are planning to visit and the facility to carry your suitcase all day in the truck with thinking that it may get lost .it is not the best way for all cases but yes for the first time on a different and far away place .when i first travel to europe , i did it with a friend and we went on a group that lasted more than a month .it was great because we met a lot of friends on the trip , from any ages and nationalities .we felt secure because we were in good hands just being with honest and reliable people who wake up every morning , take care of our personal stuff and reserved all expositions , destinys and places with previous anticipaction without thinkig if we will get tickets or not .the leader has a lot of experience in these trips so he will be more informed of the most relevant things of each place .also , if we were on a tour if there is alot of people in the trip it will be more easily to obtain discounts for expositions , also you dont need to worry if someone stole your money or if you pay for something that you may never receive or see .when you are travelling on a bus trip all your luggage will be handed directly by the personal staff and delivered directly to the bedroom you will be in .if you do that by yourself you may need to carry all your heavy personal stuff and there will be no one who will lend you a hand carrying them all day long .in conclusion i think it is better to go on a tour specially if it is the first time you have been there and the country or place is quite different as yours .however if i return to europe some day to visti the exact same places i did during that month i will be travelling backpacking just visiting the most interesting places for me and just carrying the necessaries things just to make my trip a pleasant one .
