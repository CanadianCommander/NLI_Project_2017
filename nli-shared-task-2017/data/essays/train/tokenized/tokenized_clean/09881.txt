i certainly thinks that having a broad range of knowloedge is better than knowing a only one subject deeply .however what i mean is little bit different than what it sounds like .for exmaple , if you are a leader of the orchestra , it is really important for you to know all the techniques that are used in leading a orchestra .however it can be better if that person knows how to play piano or other instruments , so he can at least knows that feeling and share the pressure of people who are following his signs .therefore i conclude that knowing many academic subjects in one broad speicific subject would be the best .these are the examples .misto takile , one of the most respected orchestra leader in japan .legend creater of yokimusa orchestra .question is why was he so great ?he was a great leader , his techniques were concise and simple to follow , therefore it reduced the confusion of players who are following , but that did not made him legend .he had something more than that ; his ability of playing piano and violin was good as a professionals , he could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middle of the practice .he was also an expert in music history , he was able to , and actually give lecture about music history in tokyo university .by knowing how to play instruments , he has share the feelings with players , and give them better , simpler leads .by knowing the music histroy , he understood better about the song .he knew broadly about his profession .that is what made him great .kim mary , world famous zoologist who designed nanjing zoo .she has been famous because of her excellent and effective designs of zoos .however for her to reach this level , she had to finish 5 majors .first she has majored in medicine , second animal medical care , third three-dimension design , fourth building construction and last but not least , zoology .she has gone through all that to become the best in her area .she knows so broad about what she is doing , she could become the best in her subject .therefore i conclude that knowing broad range about one subject is the best answer to the question .if you take little bits of everything , it does not give you depth understading and it does not help you a lot , however if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subjects around your profession , it will give you lots of credit , it also might related to other big subjects as well .you can possibly argue that einstein was a math maniac who did not know anything else except math and physic .but he was genius in a century , very exceptional case !if you are not , and to be great in your area , i think it would be more beneficial for you to know broad range over your subject .
