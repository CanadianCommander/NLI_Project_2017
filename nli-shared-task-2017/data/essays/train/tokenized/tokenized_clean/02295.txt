i beleive that a person faces all sorts of risks to become a successful man .without taking any risk it is impossible to achieve greater heights and become a successful person .therefore i strongly agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .today we are enjoying a lot of inventions and discoveries made by successful people who took risks and even sacrificed their lives .for example aeroplanes , space crafts etc .if the right brothers would have thought why to take risk and invent an aircraft , we would not have travelled from one country to other country .same thing with aircraft people would never been landed on moon .all these we are enjoying today are the risks taken by successful people to invent new things rather than doing what they already know .i have my own experience regarding this , i have a stage fear and i do nt participate in any tasks that involve a large group of audience .when iam doing my graduation , there was a science fare competitions going on in my city , the one who stands first will be given scolarship for graduation .i was inspired by my father , he is very courageous , infact he worked for the army .i took risk and participated in the fare by displaying and explaining how various stimulants like agonists and antagonists act on frog s heart .i stood first in the competition and from then onwards , i started participating in all competitions .i beleive one should take risk and enjoy the fruit of success .taking risk also involves money .investing a huge amount of money in a business , for which success is unpredictable is a type of risk .my uncle invested a huge amount on his software business .he worked very hard to invent new softwares and became a successful man in notime .now he is able to provide jobs for hundered s of people .i finally conclude that , success depends on trying new things by taking risks rather than doing what we know .
