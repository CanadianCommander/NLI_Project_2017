i am with the idea that make students understanding ideas and concept should be main aim of education system other than to teach them mere facts .i can determine understanding ideas and concept as formation .in my opinion every government in the world is under obligation to ensure its citizens neccesary conditions to get education to live a determined life .only right education policies can give them that chance .the most important value someone can get from education is not knowledge on some spesific areas or facts about some spesific process  , but formation to get the knowledge or facts whenever he or she needs .formation has some advantages to facts .first of all , formation changes somebody to a learning machine which operates most efficient way .a well equiped person knows how to get information and how much of it .he/she can avoids uneccesary ones .secondly , facts change but formation does nt .some new information raplace old ones , and only well educated person come to right conclusions when facts changed .lastly , if a person aware of importance of understanding and knowledge , he/she can refresh himself or herself comparing to others .he/she can learnnew methods and aquipments more easily .in conclusion i belive the importance of undersatndind and concept behind the facts for the reasons i implied above .
