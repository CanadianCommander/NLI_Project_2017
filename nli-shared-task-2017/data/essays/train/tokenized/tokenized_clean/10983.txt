understanding the ideas and concepts than just learning the facts are more essential for students due the different interestes , understanding and efficiency .people have different interestes in different areas .therefore , they focus on different areas .sometime , people care more bout the reasons than the facts .for example , they learn about the cause and effect of an event rather than jumping right to the conclusion and just learn the facts .by doing this , they get more familiar with the topic .besides different interestes , understanding towards the topic is equally important because once people understand what the topic is mainly about , they focus more on the additional information about the topic .also , when people understand the ideas , it is easier to learn and memorize them .therefore , understanding towrads the ideas are required because it makes people think more and learn more .time is another significance factor .if people start on the unfamiliar topic right away without previewing or understanding the ideas , it takes much more time to acutually learn the facts form them .for example , if people previews their lessons before class , they know what the teacher is going to talking about .therefore , they can understand the concepts in the class rihgt away without taking another reviewing time later .also , during the class time , they can ask questions and have good interaction with the teacher .in conclusion , it is more important for students to actually understand the concepts than it is for them to learn facts beacause of different interestes , understanding and efficiency .
