in my opinion there are two oppositing points of view from which one could see the situation .first you could agree with the statement that successful people try new things rather than only doing well known thinghs because they can allow themselves to be experimental for there is no financial pressure .they are , due to their success , able to come up with negative effects of their behaviour and they also have the capital to invest in new innovations for example .whereas poorer people or just people without overwealming success might have great financial pressure and have also the fear to lose what they have already reached .so they are more likely to play on the safe side .a poor company might use its old computersystems for a longer time than a rich one for firstly the poorer one does nt have the needed money and secondly because newer systems might not work that dependable .second , one could also tell the story the other way round :successful people might become more carefully because of they re afraid of loosing their wellbeing life and their position in society which implies that they take not the unknown road .for example a famous food chain would never change the slogain or the kind of marketing strategy as long as the food sells well .in comparison with that , unsuccessful people have nothing to lose so they might tend to try out new things for it ca nt get worse .a small unknown company may try out a variety of marketing strategies to find out which one causes the highest sells .there are always these two options .which way is meant tyo be taken depends on every individual character which is challenged by a decision like described above .so i ca nt agree the statement that successful people are more willing to take risks in gerneral for there are as many reasons speaking against this thesis .
