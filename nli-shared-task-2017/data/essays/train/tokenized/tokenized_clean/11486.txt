which do you prefer the person who knows everything a little and the person who knows one thing deeply for your life ?there will be no nessary to think of answering this .human society is so complicated that person who knows only one subject can not surive in competion .thus i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for getting better grades , having chance to adjust main subject and creating developed and combined subject .understanding many academic subjest help to get good marks for main subject .academic subject are have related each other .that means every subject can help understang the others .in my case , learning linear algebra in math department helped to understand in computer graphics in computer science which is my major subject .also creative writing class helps me to write good paper for each subject .like this manner , knowing many academic subject are good to get good mark .second , broad knowledge of many academic subjects give a chance to adjust main subject .choosing the main subject is important because it is related ones job .so by knowing many academinc subject , student get to chance to adjust their subject .they can find good od bed last , it helps to create new developed area .people created robotic by combing biology and computer technogy .it does not happened with only knowing one subject .in conclusion , broad knowlege of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .it helps to get a good grades , to having time to think if choosen subject is suit for indivisual and combined more decent area .someday , university student have to study more complicated and more subject for graduate since many subject will be combined and developed in relationship for more years .
