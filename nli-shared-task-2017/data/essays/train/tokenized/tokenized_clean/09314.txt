yes , it s all true .in mine particular case i have seen this question because i come from a little city where there is a different type to think respect a big city as milan .i find my time for mine community because is the place where i live and i prefer to live in a community which i have built .many youngs have lost ours values .that values which it has stayed of my parents and my grandparents .there is one good reason : i think which the new generations are too vicious .i m agree with the fact which the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because there is too things which it brings out the way the youngs as me .for examples the drugs , the too drink , necessity of to have more simple moneys and the fact which there is nt a good social statement who it follows young people .the life is hard but to give for the others mean to receive .
