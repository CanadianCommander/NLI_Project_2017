if you ask me if advertisements make products much better that they really are , my answer will surely be positive .in my opinion there are a lot of reasons to support this fact .these reasons have a feature in common : that advertisement are always based on deceit .first , when you see one product on tv , you see not the real product , but only a `` visual manipulation  of it .it will always seem bigger , brighter , better than what it really is .in order to explain this , are you really sure that the famous big mac is really as `` big  as it seems ?i do nt think so .so , before you chose to buy a product , go and see it in reality .most of the time , it will be a delusion .another point is the fact that , during an advertisement , there are a lot of `` distracters  .in other words : it is not the product itself what is important , but what is around it .for instance : haven  t you noticed that , in a lot of advertisement , there are a lot of beautiful girls or men ?what is the connection between a product to paint gates and a young pretty girl ?so , the advertisement remains in our mind not because of the product , but because of `` other  factors .the last point is that advertisements play on our imagination : we do nt buy the product for what it really is , but only for what we believe it is .this `` imagination factor  is created by a combination of the previous mechanisms , and yet others , that gain their strenght upon other , even unconscious , weaknesses .so the bottom line is , never trust the advertisements , because they will always play tricks on you .
