that is a really difficult question .i think cars a one of the most important vehicle which we have and want .we need it every day , it does not matter what we do .if we go to to work , if we go to sport or if we just visit a friend , we going almost every time by car .indeed , we can use a puplic vehicle like a bus or a train too , but in some cases it is really difficult or just impossible to go somewhere by bus or train .i live in a very small town , which is almost 30 minutes away from my school and from the next big city .if i go by bus and train to school , it would take me more than one houer .i would spent one houer on the way to school and one houer on the way back .by car i just need half the time , so i safe quiet a lot time in which i can do other things , things which are more important .just if we get something else as a car , like little plains , then i guess it would be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .the current standard is not the final result , but it is a starting point for new and better development .therefore it is possible , that in few years we going by little plains to work or school .a vehicle was the most important invention in the 19th centuries , it makes our life much easier .accordingly i do not think that we just say , okay all vehicle away and we do not need them either .we have to develop new and better cars to protect things like nature .nature is one of the most important thing which we have in the whole world .but we destroy a part of it with pollution .that we have to change .this is the only reason which i can think of , that we get fewer cars or vehicle , because our nature is distroyed to much .but present we do think about it , to solve this problem , like a mentiond above already , we develop new and better cars with less pollution .we all the cars are away , we would have a lot of workless poeple .if i just think about , how many peole work in the car industry , that is quiet unimaginale , because that are so a lot .in reason of all above mentioned facts and my own opion , which i also tried to explaind about , i think we would have everytime somethink like a car or a vehicle .
