nowadays we are involved in an overwhelming stream of advertisements .there are advertisements everywhere , on tv , magazines , even on every corners in the streets and it s impossibile not to notice them , even if you want to .we are not only involved by advertisement , but also strongly influenced , even if sometimes we do nt admit it because we are sure that we are superior to certain things , but advertisements are more subdulous that we expect .i agree with the statement , because we are so influenced that we arrive at the point that we buy one thing better than another only because more publicized .and what s the main problem ?we trust advertisements too much !!advertisements manage to make things better because there are a lot of minds behind who think how to propose an article to the public , in a way that exalts its best features and hides the worst ones .adverstising in this way is not correct and loyal towards the public because it is nt honest about the features of the products .how many times we have bought an article , thinking that it s in a particular way or it does particular things while it s actually very different !!and what a disappointment !!i get really angry when it happens to me .for example , when i was a little child i saw on tv a really fantastic little robot which did ( which would have done ) a lot of things , such as bringing glasses as a waiter , going alone around the room , recording my voice and playing cds and so on .but as soon as i brought it to my house i cuold notice that he was able to do only half things that i expected ..maybe because it was a really bad product ??you can object me that this is a generalization , and maybe you re right .i think it too : not all the products are got better in advertisements and not all the companies make advertisements in this incorrect way .some people are honest and clear about their products and i really appreciate them , because i think that advertisement should be a means to get articles know to the public and to get people who watch tv or read the magazine aware that a particular thing exists , but as it is and not as it should be .
