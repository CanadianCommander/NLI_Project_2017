today , education is a very important factor for the personal development and as a concequence , many people have a wide knowledge in different subjects .for my person , i agree and also disagree with the statements due to the following reasons .one one side , a students should concentrates himself on one specific topic .today , there is so much to learn about on subject , you do not have the time to study an other subject .imagine the subject biology .there are so many inventions in the technology for biology and this inventions result in new discoveries in the subject .as a concequence , students and also graduate persons always have to update their knowledge and that would not provide the time which is needed to study a different subject .therefore , a specialisation absolutly necessary to be good at his subject .but in my opinion , there exists also a differt view .influences like globalisation and environmental pollution have changed the world .everthing is connected together .further , society deeply depends one nature .and in this framework , it is really important the we know how the world is connected .a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can provide this knowledge .for example , a chemist in a big chemistry company can only do his job well , when he also know what consequences can occur in the environment and even in the society .in conclusion , in my opinion there are some reasons why i should support the statement of specialisation and also some reasons why i shoud support the broad knowledge of academic subjects .
