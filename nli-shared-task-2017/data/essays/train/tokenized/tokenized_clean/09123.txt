i really enjoy travelling .in my life , i would like to visit the most countries in this world .however , what is the best way to travel ?i have experienced travel in a group led by a tour guide .also , i have traveled in a group without tour guide .so , i can say that i do agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i will talk about both way of travelling .when i graduated in high school , some students and i planed a trip to paris .we choose to travel with a tour guide when we arrived in paris .this is the best trip i have ever taken .the trip guide know almost any kind of entertainment in paris , with him , we discovered paris and his surrounding .he brought us to visit the effel tower , the champs elysee .second , the tour guide brought us to a small cities surrounding paris , and we enjoy the nature , the architecture of this part of the cities .the advantage of travel with a tour guide is that he know the map of the cities , therefore , he has no difficulty to guide us .however , the most significant disadvantage to travel with a tour guide is that it require additional money .i also travel with some friends without tour guide .we decided to visit the city of quebec .it was really difficult for us to read a map and visit the city because it was our first time to travel in this town .we did nt enjoy the trip as we did when we were in paris .must of the time we were in quebec , we frequently ask direction to people around the street .some of these people were willing to help us , but other were to busy to take a time to guide us .fortunately , it was cheaper to travel without a tour guide .to conclude , there are several advantages to travel in a group led by a tour guide because this person pocess knowledge related to tourism .however , as i enjoy travelling , travel in group without a tour guide can be great especially when i do nt have enough money to pay for a tour guide .
