i think that i am the kind of person who is willing to give a lot of time to helping my community , but when i get right down to it i can not find so much time .probably , like me , a huge amount of persons experiences the same problem .i absolutely agree with the statement but , at the same time , i can understand why different categories of people do not spend time helping others .first of all , young people are extremely busy with their classes and sport activities .writing papers , preparing seminars and doing homeworks require quite half of the day of each student .in addition , they are usually asked to be part of a sport team and so they spend several hours a week training and improving their performances .as a consequence , they are unable to help others , but i think that they do not feel happy about it .normally students are altruist and they feel like they are wasting time when they can not improve the life of the community they belong to .secondly , people , who have a family and children , are completely full of stress .sometimes , they have their own work in the morning and then once at home they have to take care about children .i think that the real problem is that the life is too fast for them .all day long , families are planning something or improving something different .in this way , they can not understand the importance of taking their own time and dedicate some of it to the community .poor and alone people , for instance , would be enthusiastic spending a weekend with a family , but , anyway it does not happen so frequently .concluding , i want to say that even if i can understand different and valid reasons that lead people living apart from their communities , i hope that , tip by tip , everyone will recognize the importance of spending time within a community .it can add value to the routine everyone experiences during the week .perhaps , i will start doing something for my hometown little community from tomorrow .
