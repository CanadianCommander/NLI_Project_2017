education is not only the reason people get hired everyday for different types of job , it is also a way of life .to decide whether it s better to specialize in a subject than to learn about many subjects is a lifetime decision .depending on the person and his/her aspirations , his/her decision about specialization will be taken .i m more of a specialized person .i prefer to learn a lot about an interesting subject for me than to learn about many other subjects that may be not so relevant for my taste .in my future , i expect to become a proffesional astronomer .since i was young , i ve known that there s no way for me to become an astronomer if i do nt specialize in astronomy and physics .if i wanted to become an astronomer and also have broad knowledge of many other academic subjects , i ll forever be a college student .maybe that does nt sound that bad , does nt it ?but i would also like to raise a family and maybe , being a college student all my life is not going to help me in taking care of my kids .in contrast with being an astronomer , there s a proffesion that requires a broad knowlege about many subjects : teachers .the teachers are like second parents to any son or daughter who gets enrolled in an academic program .and maybe teachers are divided into types of classes given , but a great teacher is the one that knows about everything .sure you can learn about math from your calculus teacher but , what about a little history ?would nt that be great ?if a person decides to become a teacher , this person must be determined to study about many subjects and not just one .another example of broad knowledge is our grandfathers and great-grandfathers .what we have today is because of them .and most of them were nt specialized in a subject ; they knew something about everything .they are the reason our parents are here and our parents are the reason why we are here .maybe if all our grandfathers had some sort of specialization , our lifes would have been completely different .so , in a way , people with broad knowledge were the founders of our society .but during this times , there s space for everyone .you can specialize in a subject or not .the key is to decide what do you want for your life and to remember that everyone is different : i may be a specialized person , maybe you are nt .but we all are capable of learning and success only depends on effort , no matter what type of education is chosen .
