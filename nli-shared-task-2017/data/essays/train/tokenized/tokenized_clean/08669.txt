i think , it is absolutely necessary to understand the whole idea and the whole concept of a topic .on my opinion , only then it is possible the get the core and the intention of a topic .if students would only learn single facts , they would never receive a complete picture of a subject .they permanently would have single pieces of information but never a whole picture , they would absolutely lack an overview of everything - like in a puzzle where some pieces are missing .furthermore , all ideas or concepts themselves contain facts which are embedded into them , so it is not even possible to lern about an idea without learning - at least a few - facts .my experience has shown that i have less problems to learn and to remember both , the whole idea as well as important facts and details , when i have understood the whole topic .i have tried to learn only single facts a few times , for example at maths , a subject i am not very good at .i only learnt single formulas but had no idea about how all these formulas worked together in any relationships .in those cases i never got access to the deeper sense of the materia .another example i have already experienced , was when i had to learn a lot for the university .especially in one management course there was so much content during the whole semester , i really was afraid i could not cope with .but at the end of the semester , when i had understood all ideas of the content , all information matched and fitted together nearly alone .i really was < in the topic > .so finally i could use all information i had to learn , because i knew what they were all about , i could categorize them and use them in the right way .i am sure , this would not have been possible , if i only had learnt the facts .summarizing , i think students get not only a better , but also a wider knowledge by understanding ideas rather than single facts .
