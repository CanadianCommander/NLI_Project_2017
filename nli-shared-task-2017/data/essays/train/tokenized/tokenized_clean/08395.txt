every grandmother talks about the good-old days , when the younger were more helpful the old ones , respectful for family values and community culture .well , somebody has to tell them back that the times have changed !i agree that young people are not like in the old times , because they are more individualistic , they have less time for family and community but more for work .also the old ones have changed !they are more healthy and socially active , so they do not need younger ones as they did in the past .first of all , everbody will accept that we are now living in a society where everyone lives an individual life , rather than as a part of a community .this individuality has physical aspects and also cultural aspects .for example , the number of people working in cities or even countries different then where their family live , is going higher and higher every year .how can somebody be helpful to his community , if he is 1000 miles away ?this is physically not possible .and culturally , with all the media and advertisement bombardment telling the people that the only important thing in this life is themselves but nothing else ; how can young people not be individual caring about only their own lives ?the times have also changed in terms of the time which we must spend for things other than family isues .young people have to spend much of their time in their school and work .they can not even find enough time to deal with all these , actually .that results in less time for the family and community again .lastly , the old ones also changed !they are healthier , and socially more active than they used to be .they need the younger ones less and less by the advances in technology also .which means it is not only the younger ones that have changed .the world we live in is certainly different than what it had been before .one of the results is that younger people are not into their comunities as much as they did in the past .they are more individualistic , they have less time , and actually the older ones needs them less , too .
