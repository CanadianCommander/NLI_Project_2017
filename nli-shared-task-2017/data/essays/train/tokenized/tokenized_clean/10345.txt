traveling with a tour guide is far more efficient than traveling alone .arriving in an unknown location may cause nerves or ultimatley , get one lost .when one travels in a group with a guide , one is able to obtain much more background information than by bieng alone .this information will make every penny worth s while .in addition , being with a guide can also mean safety .a guide is an experienced professional that knows where and when to take one .getting off of the plane and wondering where to go can be frustrating .people that undergo this frustartion may even become so distratced as to leave thier luggage behind .also , when one arrives , one is not sure exaclty where to go and by which means .if one gives a taxi driver the wrong address , one will be having to spend one s money and time .all this precious time that could be spent in viewing new places , is spent in figuring out how to get to the hotel or guessing the locationin which one is in .after being able to arrive to the hotel , and ready to extract the essence of that place , one is not sure of what that means .most of the time , when being in an unknown country , one is not completey familiar with the native language .it is extra difficult to communicate or express one s thoughts .finally , in the museum , taking pictures of the beautiful arts , one begins to think of what it is or who has done it .if one had been in a tour guide , one would have learned who has created the masterpieces , what it is , what is its symbolic value or when it was done .this information will not sporadically get into one s mind .wanting to retrun from that exhausting trip , merely surving , one gets robbed , cheated on or smuggled .usually , tourists who are not accsutomed to traveling or are not advised , are easily identified in foreign lands face danger .safety is a great issue that foreigners face .therefore , in order to enjoy the trip , it is recommended to go with a tour group .
