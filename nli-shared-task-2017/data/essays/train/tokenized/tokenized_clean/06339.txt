i belive that it is much more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i feel that it is useless if students rely on memorizing facts only , this is because as life goes on , what sticks to our minds is what we understand and comprehend , and not what we siply memorize .generally speaking , it is very difficault to memorize a fact without first understanding it .take the process of photosynthesis in plants as an example , i remember very well trying to memorize all the complicated steps and stages involved in this process without first understanding them , and what did i get ?nothing .it was a complete waste of time and energy .yet when i went back to my biology teacher , and after explaining it to me , i found it much easier to memorize and comprehend .hence to me personally , undersatnding the ideas and concepts is a must-do before even thinking of starting to `` learn the factsas we go through every experince in life , whether it is a learning experience , or just an every day experience , we make sure to understand what is going on around us , hence we try as hard as we can to get involved .when we simply learn facts , we are not involved in the actual process of learning , and we can not therefore enjoy that feeling of pride that a person gets when understanding a challenging task or peice of knowledge .for exapmle , if a student memorises a mathemetical question , it would be a complete wate of energy and time , yet when that student truly understands that task , he/she will never forget it and will positively benifit from that true learning experience .even when we talk about the regular day-to-day tasks that one always goes through , we see , again , that it is a very important to understand a task before memorizing it .take the simple process of tying a shoe !it is very important that the child knows the basic idea of that simple process and watch it several times analysing it , before actually learning those simple facts .finally , we conclude that it both understanding the concepts and learning the facts are ways of learning that at many time can not be separated .i believe that understanding the ideas and concepts are still more important as they are the first step in the process of learning .
