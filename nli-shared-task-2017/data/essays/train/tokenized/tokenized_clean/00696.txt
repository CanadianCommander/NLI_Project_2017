yes , i agree that the authors primafacy recommendation is militating .successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know already how to do well .firstly , successful people try to do new things and they want to innovate some thing for others .for instance i admire dr.adul kalam ajad .he is one of the great , scintilllating and dynamic strongconsistancy person in india .he is one of the successful person .actually he was a techer in a school .but his anxiety and strong determination makes him now a president of india .though he is a successful person but he dont want to do what he already known .he was great scientist in india .secondly , the other example is nelson mandela .he is a great leader in south africa .he had imprisoned for twenty years .even though his experience made him as his dream strong and deterministic .at finally he can achieved the independence of his country .so he is my one of the great leader .at present he is working as a president position of u.n.o.even he is also a great succeessful person .but he never thinks that only doing what they alredy know how to well .thirdly , gandhiji is god for india country .by his only his efforts made now india is on at present position .his slogan is peace for all things all over the world .he is also a great succeessful person thst ever known .so according to my view succeessful makes people and thinks innovatively .so try to think positive dont think negative .go ahead and for u r dreams .jai hind .
