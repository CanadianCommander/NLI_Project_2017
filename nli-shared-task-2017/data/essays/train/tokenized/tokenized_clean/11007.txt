according to the question `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities  i agree to the fact in the question .i feel that this issue is not in a specific country or community but its almost in the entire world of humans .life compared to the past has changed a lot today .the generations today have a busy life of their own and may have forgotten their responsibilities of giving a helping hand to their community .in todays life the young people are busy with their jobs , own family , kids and are trying to give better comforts , good education and a luxirous living to their children .talking about jobs or a busy profession there is so much competition among the co-workers to update themselves and go to better positions through promotions .in certain situations the young people forget the sacrifices their parents did for them , in bringing them up to a good position by giving them good education and providing all the nessicities they required in their childhood .there are a lot of old age homes comming up every where all over the world for the older community .the strong reason behind this is the older community is being neglected by the young ones .there are other reasons too in a developing country like india where the population is very high and there is a lot of unemployment , in such situations the youngsters have nothing to do for themselves and are helpless in their own situation and can not do anything for their own community or older community .financial burden is one factor that everyone faces today and the greed for a better position and a greed for more money make the younger generation selfish at times .so according to me the younger generation do not concentrate in helping their communities either the older or younger communities .
