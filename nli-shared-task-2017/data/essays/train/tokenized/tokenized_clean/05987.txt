it is asked whether grasping the idea and concepts are more valuable than learning and just memorizing the facts .i hold the view that , although sometimes it is useful to learn the facts , to be able to understand the idea and the underlying reasons behind a particular topic is far more crucial .the students should be expected more than learning the facts and ways of critisizing these facts should be taught them .to begin with , i believe that the facts do not always remain constant .they can change with time and old facts can be replaced with completely new facts .thus , the facts itself are not always reliable .to illusrate it with an example , before galileo and some other scientists it was believed that the world was flat .besides , it was a well accepted fact .however , later the facts were questioned and replaced with newer facts .what i can recommend here is that learning the ways which go to these facts are more important and the ideas and concepts behind these facts form a more solid understanding for the students .secondly , the facts are usually more difficult to keep in mind .since i am also a student , i know very well that the facts are easily forgotten after one year or even after the courses finish .thus , to understand ideas would enable the students to carry their knowledge to their later periods of life .besides , focusing on the concepts and general ideas would also enable them to study more effectively , since they are usually more easy to remember .thirdly , the facts do not prepare the students for a real life at all .usually at school , the students just keep the facts in mind , which are explained by the teacher .later on , the students just memorize the facts in order to be ready for the exams and they usually do not grasp the topic as a whole or they can not add something from themselves .however ; when these students will graduate afterwards and will be in the real life , they will be expected to be able to interpret , to make comments and to offer new solutions based on basic ideas and concepts .therefore at school , the students should be trained and encouraged to question the facts and offer alternatives to these facts .that is often a more effective way of education than learning the facts .in conclusion , i support the idea that to understand the ideas and concepts is more crucial than just trying to keep the facts in mind .there is no guarantee that the facts would remain as they are and a student should learn to do more than just memorizing the facts in order to be ready for a life outside of school when they graduate .thus , students are better encouraged to understand the ideas and concepts and be able to critisize the facts , which i think is more important than the facts .
