cars are transportation that is useful for life .in thirthy years before nearly there is no car used but it become more comman then espically nowadays there is a car nearly in a family .because cars are used for many reasons but maybe in twenty years cars are used fewer than today there is some reasons for this stiuation .first of all , cars will leave its place to another transportations like plane , ship , bicycle and etc .maybe people go everywhere by plane or ship it is much more comfortable and taking less time than cars .in adittion to his people can not tired because they will not use car everything will ready for them they only will buy tickets and take rest for them .in this way people will trip a lot they will get accusttem this and want it nearly a month .so the cars will be teking their place to another transportations .the other reasons for leave up cars is that cars are taking of pollution to the environment .and cars are caused a lot of traffic jam the reasons for taking car will usefull gor everything .in contrast to cars uses it gives a lot of damages to the other parts of life .in conclusion , cars are maybe more comman now but i agree that it will be restricted within twenty years .so it will be so
