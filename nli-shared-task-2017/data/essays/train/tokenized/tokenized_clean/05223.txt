` community  is the sole of any civilization .the stronger the community is the better would be the civilization .since community consructs the society and socity has a big impact on the life style of the people living in the society and the literature written , and all these things reflect the progress and prosperity of the nation .as far as the role of young people in the developmant of the society or community is concern , i am completely agree with the fact that young people are not paying much attentions towards their society now days .young people act as the base for any society because thay have the energy and courage .they are the flag carries of their community .any commuinity is reflected by its younger generations .but now days young people are not understanding their duties towards their community and their nation .people are geeting more and more self centred and this selfishness is leading them towards this .people should realize that its only the community that is going to help them .one can not live in isolation .let us take a example to explain this point .suppose if we isolate a person from a community then would the person will servive ?the answer is definitely negative .one can not survive without an environment .the person is dependent on the community for his basic needs .all the functions of a community are inter-dependent .one can not perform all the fuctions alone .so here the youths need to understant the fact that they can not survive without a society .secondly , if you are living in an environment then there would be a proper balance between you and the environment .your environment must be a developed one in the same way as you are .to explain this point let us take the example of a tree surrounded by a dirty land then definetly that dirty surroundings are going to hinder the growth of the tree .so we must learn here the importance of community and its development .nowdays youths are not contributing towards the development of their community .they must reallize the fact that development can not be made alone .you wo nt be cosidered as the developed person until unless you belong to a developed nation .so in conclusion of my view i would like to state that young people , including me as well , should reallize their duties towards their communities and should come forward to uplift it .i would like to urge them to work for the prosperity and development of their community .
