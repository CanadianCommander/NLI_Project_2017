since you are a child , your parents , and other facors , teach how do well in your work , or in an activity .when people grow up , they choose and follow their own way , which can be differents of that way that their parents teach them .some successfull person try new things and take risks , rather than other person only doing what they already know how to do well .i agree with this statement .people are influence by the money , the own personality .first , the money has an important impact on someone s behavior .the money drives the people crazy .nowadays , the money represents the only thing that make people happy , relax and safe .it means that successful people , people which have a good job and earn money , can try new things , take risks , and have novel experiences .they are safe and can pay for the new activities they want to try , or can take risk to play to casino , for instance , because they are sure to have money after have lost .it is the same way in the work .they can take risks because they are succesful and have money .if they make a mistake , they do nt worry because they have money so they are safe .however , a person who are no successful and also not very rich ; this person ca nt do what she wants to do , try new things , or just take risks .it means that all these three facts represent a risk or have to be due to a long reflection .people without money do nt have choice .they do what they already know howdo well , in the aim to be safe and take risks .for instance , a successful person wants to try something new such as rock climbing .it is not a probem for her .in contrary , a person without money ca nt wake up a morning and say she wants to try this activity .she does nt have money to spend in that .she has to work for that .it means omly doe what she already know how to do .secondly , the personality of each person have a huge influence .some people wants to enjoy the life , everytime , rather than other prefer just follow the cheep s group , and do what their parents teach them .after , there are the person who are afraid to take risks or try new things .they are scared to pass away from the everyday life , and they are simply afraid of what they do nt know .for instance , the person succesful are generally the person narrow-minded , extravageant , who express themselves and want to enjoy the life in every minutes whatever the risks .in contrary , i remember than when i was fifteen years old i was scared of what i did nt know .i did nt know it so i did nt if it was risky , good or bad .also , i was afraid if my parents were agree or like this or this new things .i just simply do what i know do well .to conclude , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it enjoy the life , become independant , and live iyour own life in your own view of the world .the life its to short to do nt be ex
