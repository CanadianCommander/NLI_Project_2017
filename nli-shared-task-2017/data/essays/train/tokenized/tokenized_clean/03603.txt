i think that the number of cars in this time will be fewer than that in tenty years later .i think above becaus of air pollution problem , improvement of other transpotation systems and expenxive lands .first of all , air pollution will be more serious .cars pollute a lot of duty gus .even now , air pollution is serious social problem .people will notice that we must not leave the duty environment for thier sons nad daughters .so , they will escape to driving cars .other people will think that they want to lung cancer .so they will not buy cars .finally , many people think that driving car is bad thing for earth and all lives .secondy , other transpotation systems will be more improved .now government and transportation company spend money to improve public transportation system , such as lrt and buses , in part of software and hardwre .the more usuful public transportation become , the more poeol use thies systems and the less number of using cars is .finally , government can not get land cheeply .we have constructed enoumas roads for cars .but there is no land that government can get cheeply .now , in the city , lands are fill with houses , factories , and roads .so govenment can not construct the road that people wont to in low construction cost .in conclud , i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewew cars in use than there are today .i will be comfortable by reduceing the number of cars .
