i belive motivation is one of the most important qualities that make people successful .seeking new opportinities and better ways is avoidable .therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that successful individuals always try new things and take risks .my mother always told me a story about my grandfather who was born in a poor neighbourhood and had no wealth when he was young .he started business with a very small shoe store .there was no employee or manager .he was the only one working there and the store was neiter famous or popular .he , however , had a ambition to make the store bigger and make more money .he borrowed some money from a bank and bought a land , then expanded the store .the decision was risky because there was not guarantee that he could pay the money back .some of my grandfather s relatives , including his own father told him to stop dreaming and be careful because he was making enough money to support his family .because of his effort , his business was significantly succeeded and he finally ownedtwo big malls .this great contribution could not be achieved without his risky challanges .he could have chosen to run the small shoes store and have comfortable life as he was told by his relatives .he did not have to worry about failing if he did , but he could not experience the great success as well .being conservative and doing things we already know are not totally useless .many people choose this way and are satisfied with their situation .however , being motivative and finding better ways will teach more lessons to people .only creative and ambitious people can innovate new great ideas and be successful .taking a risk is neccesary to be successful in any field .
