since the middle of the 20th century , cars have become a significant part of the daily life of human .consequently , most of the people are not able to imagine a life without a car .in my following essay , i would like to introduce to you my point of few on whether the use of cars in the early future will decrease or not .in the first place , we should have an in-depth view of the main function of cars .like everybody can guess , it is transportation .a car helps us to reach places , where we want to go in a pretty short time .for me personally , that means to be independent from others .the possibility to drive wherever i want to drive and which way i want to take gives me some sort of freedom .on the other hand , i can drive to the university , without needing to take public transportation , which signalizes once again dependency for me .besides of that , we should not forget , that there are also enthusiastic drivers among us , who never leave their cars unwatched .for these kind of people , a car represents a hobby , in which they like to invest all of their free time .the last , but i think most important fact is , that research is working on finding out alternative energy sources .examples , which are already in use , are electronical or solar drives , which do not need the `` classical  petrolium .through these and upcoming future inventions , car driving will become much cheaper , which will have the consequence , that more and more people will decide to drive cars .maybe petrolium and gas will get more expensive , but in maybe less then 20 years , there will be created cheaper alternative energy sources for car .
