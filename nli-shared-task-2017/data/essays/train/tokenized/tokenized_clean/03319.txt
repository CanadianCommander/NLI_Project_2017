`` knowledge is power  is the great saying that everyone knows it .one can be succesful if he have wide range of knowledge .i personally feel that it is better to have knowledge of all the subjects upto high school level and at university level it is better to go for specialization in a single subject area according to the interest of the student .if a person opt for a single subject he better understands the subject .he may put all his effort and keen interest in a single subject .he go deep into the subject and can play with it .this leads to many innovations in that particular area .for example a person like charlesbabbage invented computer which is the popular instrument that world is using today if he had not dedicated to the physical sciences this might may not happen .if a historian is not dedicated to humanities we might not know the past culture .thus opting for a single subject leads to many advantages .there are also some benefits if people have a broader knowledge of many acadamecis but fundamentals of all subjects are enough to become a master in a paritcular area .lots of subjects leads to confusion and one may not adopt a complete knowledge of all subjects .so what i think is knowledge in one particular subject is more beneficial than to have a broad knowledge in all subjects though there is a necessity of having basic knowledge of all subjects
