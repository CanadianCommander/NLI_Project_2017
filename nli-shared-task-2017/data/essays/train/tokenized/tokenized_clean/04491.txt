nowadays , we sometimes go on a trip .there are two methods to travel such as travelling by alone or group .some people assert that travelling in a group is not a perfect idea .however i maintain that i can get various benefits to travel in a group : not expensive cost to travel and apportunity to share information .first , i can enjoy traveling by cheap price .traveling costs is very high nowadays .because , if we go abroad , we could take an airplain .however if i can go the travel in a group , we can save some money .there are some rules that if taking it more than 10 people , airplain company would cut prices .this situation is same as hotel and entrance fees .for example , i went to europe last summer in a group .i went there during 15days and it was good aportunity for me .on the other hand , one of my friend also went to eurpople in same periods .eventohght we visited there same peiods and same date , we had a lot of differences in costs .i only costed about 300 $ , but my friens costed 500 $ .second , i can get various information in travelling group .visiting other countries are advantures .if you could have not visited at once , you would felt embarrased .however you can enjoy clean , safe and informative travel in group .for me , it was first time to go abroad .so i felt scared sometimes .also i did not know what i was going to do .at that time , i did not have enough information to enjou it .by using travel agency , i could book airplains and hotels .also i could have a lot of information about europe .there were many people in that group , so it was available to contact them and share information and know-how which they recognized from travelling .eventhoug we should follow travel agency s rule , i think it would be a good idea following in a group .it would be a good apportunity to using small amout of money , to expand your experience as well as to get much information .
