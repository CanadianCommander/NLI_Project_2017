unfortunately i do not spend much time helping my community , but i admire everyone who does it and try to support these people in other ways ( e.g. donations ) .there are many reasons for young pepole to spend time helping their community .some of them are listed below .on the one hand a commonly held view is that there is a growing solitude within our society an young people are looking for a family an friends .in germany every second marriage is being divorced and many children grow up in torn families .but as children need support and a person they can admire and they can identifiy with , they sometimes look for this support outside their family .therefore , there should be a growing number of young people joining organisations as the red cross or the local fire department .on the other hand , one has to constate that there is a growing lack of time that hinders young people to join these organizstions .due tu a sharpening competition within society and due to a sinking number of job offerings , children and young people might be forced to qualifiy on a vide range of sectors .in order to get a got job nowadays , you have to be excellently educated , speak 2 languages , have a lot of job expererience , be very young and pass at minimum one year abroad .as a consequence it seems more attractive for young people to spend their time maximizing their chances of getting a good job than to spend time helping their communities .another point to consider is that helping community often goes with a job which is not only requiring time but which is also not paid .it seems easier to do a job in a company .in a company you get paid for your work and it might be useful for your curriculum vitae having worked for that company .nevertheless , our society needs people who work volunteerently in order to support their community .when your house burns you will be glad that some people work volunteerently for the lokal fire department , even though it is not useful for their curriculum vitae .to sum up , there are various reasons for young pepole to give or to not give time to helping their communities .my view is that there are still enough young people being engaged for their community and doing this for a number of different reasons .as this work is very important for a society you should be very grateful these people spend their time helping their communities .
