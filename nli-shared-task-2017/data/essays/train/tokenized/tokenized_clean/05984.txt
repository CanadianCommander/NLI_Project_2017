as we move further in the new era of technology , the world of advertisment is crutial in proposing new products to the masses so as to increase their demand on the market .however , as time has gone on the world of advertising has stopped being a method to promote and has developed as a commercial industry ready to do anything in order to make a product more appealing .a possible justification to this phenomena is the `` fashion  behind each advertisment .often do we buy a product because of its appealing advertisment rather than its content .this is due to the popular fame that some products achieve through their advertisment , especially within the teenage population .as a young adult , i can see the onspread of this tendency when speaking with fellow friends and affronting the argument of wether a type of clothing is fancy or not just because of the advertisment behind it .i also think that advertisment has taken on this role because of the advancing of technology , such as television or on line pop ups , which effectivly keep on promoting products .it is because of this increased supply in ways to advertise that advertisment has taken on another role and does not limit itself to selling a product but tries to make it seem much better than it truly is .this ties in with the next concept : better technologies , such as tv animations , have induced companies in portraying products such as food as more tasty just through their advertisment .how often have we seen a pizza look more tasty on tv than on our real life kitchen table ?why not consider the increase in advertisments as more appealing than the actual product as a result of the same availability of a particular product ?for example , an expnential increase in cellular phones has requested companies to portray each cell phone as more useful , technological and handy then it actually is because of the competition that can be found in the mobile sector .thus , when we look at a newspaper ad or watch a tv commercial , i think we must take concius action to question the actual product that is trying to be sold to us at all costs , and refer to the item itself before purchasing it .
