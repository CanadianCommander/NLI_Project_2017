i agree with the statement of the topic and put my views with regard to my opinion as follows .take for example the business sector , most of the successful people in are not merely to one sector alone , they have a group of companies or if not they want to improvise their establishments by entering into different fields .standing in the place alone can not make them further more successful , and here i remember the saying `` success is not a destination it is a journeythere are many establishments of famous people which grow step by step trying new things out for the newer generation needs and the one who gets to the need of the trnd is a successful person .so in the present days of improvised civilisation and technologies new and new inventions should be done to reach the people and this could only by taking risks , and i personally feel that without risks there are no inventions and no progresses .how would one be successful without a risk or trying out new things .to state an example how would dhirubai ambani would be so succesful without his initial risk in investing for the business , with his risk today one of the largest group of reliance industries come into existence and still expanding day by day with new fields .there a lot many examples like this where success lies only after a risk .so tain any field of life success as mentioned is a journey and to pass through this journey several risks are to be taken and if not they will come to a stand still and this will not be called as success so i agree the statement that successful people try newthings rather than doing what they know .
