i agree with this the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i have two reasons to suppot my opinion .first of all , the thing refluences our diary life because we think that it is natural that our life become more convenient once a year .in this society , we use many convenient products .now we have bad idea that useless we can use some products sush as electronic products and computer comfortablely , we do not want to use these products .it is said that the way of thinking developed the following statement .for example , in my house this idea is spreading because my parents try to buy new products seem much better that they really are .actually they bought new ovan a few month ago .next , as many people require new products next to next , the company try to invent the more developing products .the efffect plays a important role in japan economic .becasue if many companies stop to invent products , japan will suffer a big problem that influences economic , society , and so on .in conclusion , i really agree with the following statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .most advertisement do not make products , our life can not keep well , and japan will be at a loss .this is important thing .
