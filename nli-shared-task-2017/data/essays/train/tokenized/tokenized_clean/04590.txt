in the last years this topic became very actualy in my country .the last university reform changes a lot of things in university career .we are going to a world that always wants students more and more specialized and this reform goes in this way .i think that we need a right rate of both subjects .a specific subject solely is not a good thing .i think that because in my field , i study engeneer , tecnology changes very fast and it is possible you likely specialized yourself in a subject that only 2 years later is preistoric .in other way a broad knowledge solely is too much out of world for students , which generally want to  take by hand  what they have just seen into books .i think university must do more broad knowledge of many subjects than specific ones .i think that knowledge of many subjects help students in the early ages of university to choose their way .they can help their to choose their major and what they want to do in their life about work .the specific subjects , after a good choosen , can help students to know good part of real situation of tecnology at the moment when they want to go in work world .i think that the really important thing is how a student challenge his school problem .i think that give yourself a good preparetion is the best thing to do .it is very important to have a good mind to challenge problem of every nature in school like in life .if you have the right  forma mentis  ( way of mind ) all things are more easy .
