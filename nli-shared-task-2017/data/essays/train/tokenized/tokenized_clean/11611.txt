youth needs to come out of the darki agree with the statement that young people these days have very less participation in the activities helping their community .due to the advanced thinking and mindsets of the people nowadays they are more oriented towards personal benefits .there are many reasons for such trend and thnikng .people these day face much more competetion in all levels be it high school or graduate school .more the competetion more is the pressure and people tend to involve themselves in achieving the single set targets than to think about society a bit .economic factors matter a time like in the middle class the parents have lot of expectations and to cope up with them you have no other choice but work for your goals .which is obviously a very good thing for people have have determinations towards their goal , but in turn its affects their social life heavily .many of the people do nt even realise that they are a part of the community and need to work helping a better one .due to advent of the modern age people tend to enclose themselves in their private places with the electronic media , and spending much of their time with it .number of social gatherings and mutual co-ordination have gradually be declining these days .gone are the days when people collectively fight for the cause to help the majority of the community .none of the youth have any interest in politics these day , they do nt care about functioning of the state .all this is gradually declining and it does nt mean that no cares now about anything not they own privately .still there are many people who actively engage themselves in helping others for the general cause , however tight their schedule is .this number needs an increase and thats not what we find happening today .people need to understand that the community they live in belongs to them and everybody needs to contribute for its the healthy functioning .they needs to come out of the selfish attitude .also taking part in activities that help the community will give us a feeling of self satisfaction and happiness .and can also be an effective way for stress relief , which is a big problem these days .
