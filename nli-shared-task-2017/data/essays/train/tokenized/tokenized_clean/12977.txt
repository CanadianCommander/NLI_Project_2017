whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is an interesting question .in the world there are people with different way of thinking , culture , behaviour and needs .as a result of this there are people that support that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because gasoline will finish , while on the other hand there are people that argue that will be more pollution so people could not drive their cars .before i decide which position to support i want to consider both point of view .i think that cars are very important in human life because with cars human can move in same parts of the world faster for instance than horse .for example i am a university student of politecnico in milano and i live about 10 km near university , so i always take my cars .moreover i think that gasoline will finish but fisics will invent other things to move the car .nowadays for instance there are electric cars .i support besides that pollution of cars is a wide problem but if fisics will invent other solutions pollution of cars can be eliminated .if a person asks me if there will be fewer cars than nowadays i am sure that i suddenly answer that i do not think this .in the end i can conclusion that i disagree with the above statement because cars are much important for the people yet .moreover i think that with cars that can not produce any pollution in the future could be more cars than today .
