i do agree that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now because of quite a few reasons .the population is incresinng rapidly , fossils fuels will soon be exhausted , pollution levels are increasing at an alarming rate - this could be a threat to humanity if it continues , recycling all the car waste is already a big issue and there are many more reasons for why cars would be less used later on .these days population is growing rapidly so are the number of cars .this could prove fatal to humankind as burning of fossil fuels cause tremendous amounts of air pollution leading to global warming .so , it would be better to use the public transport , or actually have a car pool .with the growing technology , we could also make cost effective cars that use solar power to run , hence reducing the problem of air pollution .fewer cars could be a reason because of the exhaustion of fossil fuels too .this is sure to happen because of the high rate of consumption of these fuels .so , with no other alternative , it is human tendency to discover another source of energy , which looks like a probable event .the awareness of the harms caused by different types of problems caused by usage of automobiles is spreading like a fire .so , a time is soon to come when people are going to realise and take descions to control all the disastrous effects caused due to careless usage of automobilespeople will probably cycle to close destinations , use the metros to commute between their homes and offices , walk down to the nearby store instead of driving to that place , take a local bus to travel in their city , use electric or solar powered cars which would actually prove to be cheaper as they run on non-exhaustible resources thereby reducing the number of cars .finally , i just hope that we become wiser , reduce the usage of cars , do whatever it takes to save earth from all the dangerous threats it faces today and make our world a better place to live in .after all , it was we who have ruined it , so lets come together and strive hard to make it a safe place .
