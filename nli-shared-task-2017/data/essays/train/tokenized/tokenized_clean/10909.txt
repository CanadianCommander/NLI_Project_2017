it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because they will make lot of invovations in the fields of sciences and technology .they can make the world a beautiful place to live in .firstly , man has made a techniologicals deveopments by constant application of the concepts and ideas .for example , early humans got an idea of wheel they applied this idea to carts for the transpotations purpose .after some generation this led to invention of the gears and rise of complex machinery with inovations such as cars .another example is the concept of gravity which has became extremely useful in the advancements of space explorations and understanding the feauters of the planets and what amount of .gravity is needed lif off some body or escape velocity for some satellite secondly , the concepts of mathematics like additon , substraction , divide .made easy to analyse and sythesis the data and derive solution to our complex problems .for example , counting of money , articlesthus from the above reasons , if the students understands ideas and concepts he can provide a solution to the complex problems that we are facing today .
