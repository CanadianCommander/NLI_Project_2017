success can be seen as the result of one s capacity to try new things and take risks .on the other hand , people who avoid changing and stick to what they now best are not candidates for success .we will begin by pointing the advantages and disadvantages of these statement .changes can be a good thing .for exemple , someone can decide to quit a unsatisfactory job for another one , one that is closest to its goals in life .he can decide to become a painter instead of a accountant .but by doing so , the person can find other difficulties and realize that it is not much better .so changes can not assure success .on the other hand , someone who stay at the same place all his life can miss opportunities that are giving to him .he can have regrets later .but in all , success can not be based only on whether a person takes risks or not .it must be based on something deeper .if success is being rich or famous , then of course one has to risk a lot .but if success is defined as doing what is right , doing one s duty , being honest and so on , then changes are not so important .in other words , changes become submitted to doing what is right .if it is right to remain an accountant in order to support a family and give others chances , then that is successful .if changing means only to gain something for oneself without thinking of the others , then that is not success .
