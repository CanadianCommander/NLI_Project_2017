there is no doubt that everyone wants to be success , what are the personality and skill that successful people have and we do nt have ?successful people are intelegant and independent .for me the most important personality to success is creative , as for brave , i agree with that , i think successful people like to try and take risk of new things .the fist tought i stand on this oppiean is they are not afraid of challenge , because of that , they will want to try anything new , ti find out which thing is better , they are not afraid to fell down , because they will stand up again .the seacond reason is the desire of success .if you want to be succesed , you must take risk in lots of new things , to find out which one is good which one is bad , find the good one to stand your work your bussiness , after that you will learn a lot from that experence , be stranger to face more things , that really makes you to be successful .
