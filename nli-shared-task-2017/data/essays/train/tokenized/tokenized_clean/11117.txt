i agree with this statemant for three reasons .firstly , many young people , even elementary school students , have a lot of things to do after school .some student have to do their home work , some student have to go to cram school .they have no time to concern about their communities .secondly , the way of playing has changed .developing of computer games , for example , young people tend to play inside of their houses .the longer they spend thier free time inside of thier houses , the lesser they spend helping thier communities .lastly , not only young people , but also society has changed .young people in thirty years ago , they used to play on the street , and they had plenty oppotunities to communicate and to help thier communities .recently , the number of crime in the communities increasing grately .strees near their house are no more safe place .neibours are no more reliable .some people will say that there are still young people who helps their community .however , thinking about the increasing number of old people who dieing alone , we can not avoid admitting the decreasing of young people s time to helping thir communities .it is sad , but it is true .
