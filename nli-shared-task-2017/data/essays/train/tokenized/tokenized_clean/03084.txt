i fully agree with the following statement :  young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping theor communites .it is hard to fing a youth who enjoys and is willing to help other people .i , as a teenager , admit that helping others is not my priority .one of the main reasons why i believe young people do not spend much time helping other is the lack of free time .as an student of the international baccalaurite ( ib ) program i spend a great amount of time studying and preparing for the exams in may .according to the school , we should do atleast 3 hours of homework every night .i come back from school at four thirty , then go to the gym for around one hour and then do my homework .by the time i finish it , it is already 8 or 9 oclock .this does nt leave me much time to do activities to help my community .furthermore , the little time i have free i want to spend it on things i enjoy doing the most such as meeting my friends .another reason why i think youths do not give much time to helping their communities is because of the increasing competition in the world .out parents want the best for us i.e they want us to be successful .this desire of wanting to be better than our peers has made us more selfish and therefore reduce our willingness of helping others .for example , for a professional sportsman to become the best one in world , he needs to practice a lot .these training setions take time ; therefore he will have less time to help the community .in addition , psychologically , he will only be focusing on him getting better and dismissing other things such us helping the others .competition also leads to another reason for my opinion ; the lack of even getting involved in programs for helping the community .because some of us are sometimes brought up in way that everything involves around competition we do nt even try to help others ; we do nt know what it is about .the ib requires the students to complete 150 hours of what is known as cas ( creativity , action and service . )this part of the programme encouraged me to get involved in acitivities such as collecting clothes and food for refugees , helping teacher plan activities and organise family days .i have to admit that i really enjoyed them and the feeling of satisfaction after helping other is amazing .so , because of the lack of experience , i assumed that helping others would be borring and not worth ; however , i realized it was the opposite .in conclusion , i believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they do nt want to or sometimes is nt even their fault .programs such as the ib has noticed this weakness in the current teenager and is trying to recover their interest in helping others .i think that parents and teacher should also emphazise the importance of these and the benefit we get for doing it .
