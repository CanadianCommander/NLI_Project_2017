we learn a lot of knowledge from school .teachers usually teach us to understand ideas and concpets from books .we usually learn facts after we face it or after we get experience .i disagress this statement .i think that learn facts is more practical than understand ideas after we have job .i believe that learning facts is very practical and it will help us in the future .we usually learn concepts from books .we rarely learn facts from books .so most people learn facts after they have a job .somtimes , people do nt understand facts , so they get into the trobules .here is an example , i have a friend .she just graduated from school last year .she used to work in a restaurant .after three months , she told me that the facts are very different from ideas and concepts .she could nt realize why everything is different from books at begun .moreover , she had a lot agreements with her boss , and she got into trouble .she felt unhappy everyday .therefore , she quti this job .in conslusion , i believe that learning facts is more important than understand the ideas and concepts .i think that if my friend could learn facts in school or from books , she might not got into trouble and lost job .in short , learning facts is more important .
