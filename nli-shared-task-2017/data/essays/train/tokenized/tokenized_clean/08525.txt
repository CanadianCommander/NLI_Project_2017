i m absolutly agree with this statement .i think that is important for all poele not only for students to understand the information than it is for to learn facts , in fact in every situations , for example at school or also in the job , it is better understand very well before to do samethings .the italian university is based on this concept and i think that it is important study the concepts to do nt make a mistakes .i study industrial design and the courses are organized in this way : during the first semester i have to do courses of theorie subjects , for exsemple math , phisical or geometrical draw , instead in the second semester i have practise matter called laboratory .in laboratory class i can use my theories informations , that i have studied in the first semester , for design a product that have not bed caractheristics .i can write an example to exprime better my idea : i design a table , this table have to be stable and resistent , so i can do the table with this caractheristics only if i have studied `` statica  .make a mistakes is too simple when i do nt undestand what i do , in general , and how i do somethings , in particular .i have to know all the steps that i have to pass to arrive at the end of a product .in short i believe that it is better at beginnig undestand the request , keep all the informations about a concept and after that i can do everything .
