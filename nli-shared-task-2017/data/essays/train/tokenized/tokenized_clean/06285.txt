i m agree with the following statement : most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are .we can separe two kinds of advertisements : those direct to products , and those direct to persons .there are many possibility to increase the apparence of anything or anyone .teelling about the advertisements that make products much better than they really are , we can give a lots of examples : colorants in foods , pesticides in vegetable or fruits , etc .many people think that a beautiful products is better than a unlikely product .it is nt true .in fact the produces use the advertisements for sell a product than can not be sell for its apparence ; but this not means that the produtc is good .there is an other type of advertisements .nowadays , in fact , it is widesprerad the use of the chilurgie plastic for seem much beatiful or young whose the person really is .other way for seem better is the cosmetic .each way , however , change the really apperence of the people and bring other people than are less beautiful to feells bad .
