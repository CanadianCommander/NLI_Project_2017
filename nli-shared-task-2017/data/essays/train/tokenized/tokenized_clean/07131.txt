knowing and learning facts is important , but it is not everything that is necessary to live a successful life .the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.  is absolutelly correct .what advantage do i have , if i can name all presidents of the us , or if i know all distances from the earth to the planets if i do not know how to use this knowledge or where to refer it to .factual knowledge , in my opinion , is simply usefull in quiz shows .on the other hand , if a student understands the idea and the concept of a problem , he or she is going to succeed .if the student understands the problem or the idea , he or she will be much more likely to solve it .factual knowledge may only underpin the action but it is not going to lead to a solution .an other aspect stating the importance of the understanding of ideas and concepts , is the fact , that those students will remember things easier , because they are able to refer it to a specific topic .they may also be able to use this earned knowledge on other things and be able to understand those things faster .by understanding ideas and concepts it will be much easier for them to remember facts , without even pointing them out as facts .as an example , let s have a closer look on two students taking a history test .one student has simply studied the facts , has learnd the years and the events , but does nt know how those events connect and refer to each other .it will be hard for this student to answer a question that asks to summarize or give an own opinion about their actions .the other student on the other hand , focuses more on the `` why-questions  , such as why did they do this or why did it end like this .even if he does not remember the exact years , he will be able do answer difficult questions because he knows how everything is related to each other .it will be easy for this student to settle back in this time and act accuratively .taking everything into account , i think that students who understand the ideas and concepts will remember facts automatically , because they are able to refer them to something they are familiar with .those students who simply learn facts , are most likely to forget them as soon as the test , etc. is over .and in my opinion , that is not the goal .the goal for each student should be to understand the ideas and concepts and remember them as long as possible .
