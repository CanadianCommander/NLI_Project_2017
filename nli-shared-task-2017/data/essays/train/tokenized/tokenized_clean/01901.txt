some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .this solution presents the advantage of not having to worry about the organization of the trip .although this way of travelling is easy , i personnaly prefer to avoid the touristic routes and adapt my schedule to my own interests and mood , rather than be part of a guided tour .travelling in some countries , where languages and cultures are real boundaries ( japan , china , ... )can be really challenging .guided tours in these cases facilitate greatly the process of organizing a journey to such areas of the world .guided tour also generally focus on the most remarkable locations and attractions that `` must  be seen .they sometimes provide a valuable insight on the local culture and past .in some cases , a guide is even absolutely required to venture in parts of the world such as deserts .however , guided tours tend to always target the most touristic sites .in countries like vietnam or china , guided tours have created real touristic routes .i believe that following these paths do not provide a good idea of how the country works , how the people live , etc . ..some highly visited places also are of less interest than what advertised by the gided tours , which result in loosing precious time .when i travel , i therefore prefer to have the freedom to visit less touristic places , modify my schedule as i wish and meet with the local people .even if i do nt speak their language , i think that communication is always possible .a few years ago , i spent two months in india .i had the chance to live for four weeks in a small village in south inda s countryside .i felt that sharing the life of the village inhabitants helped me to understand the complexity and harshness of life in this part of the world .during the following three weeks , i traveled all around south inda and i found myself much more receptive to the indian specificity and customs .this unique experience would not have been possible if i had travelled in a group led by a tour guide .as a conclusion , i would say that when a guide in not absolutely needed , guided tours are not the best way to travel .travelling in a group sometimes results in missing little or extraordinary things that tells a great deal about a country .
