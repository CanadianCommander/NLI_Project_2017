i strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing only what they already know how to do well .because without taking the risks and trying new things one can never be successful in his life .his success is very limited by the adopted procedures .if we ca nt take risks and try another things how can we develop new things , make new discoveries .it is only because einstein conducted 1000 experiments we get bulb .it is by taking chances and risks one can do creative works .every new technology is created by taking risks and trying new things .take the example of television in 1980 there are black and white ctvs and by trying new things technology is upgraded day by day .relate the television of now with that of 1980 now we have screen up to the size of 100 inches and we have lcd tv and plasma tv which is 100 times better than the past tv in terms of technology , size and graphics .it is only because of trying new things .definition of business is to try new things and take risks .if you stick to the adopted methods you will only go to a certain limit .if you want to touch the sky then you must try new things .take the example odf wipro chairman mr. azim premji he has a vegatable oil bussiness but he tries new things and had taken risks and now wipro is billion dollar software company .take another example of infosys mentor mr. narayan murthy a middleclass man in 1980 try a idea of opening a software compony with ten people by contributing rs .10,000 only by every member and now infosys is a global softwre company .it is because he take risks and moreover try something unique and now he is a successful man .therefore i strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .i support this by giving specific reasons to support this .
