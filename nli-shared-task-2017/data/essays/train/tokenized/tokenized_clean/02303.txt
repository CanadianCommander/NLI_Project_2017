although the stated statement looks unbelievable , but i agree to the point mentioned and is based on following :first , almost governments of all countries are concentrating on improvement and betterment of public mode of transport .i believe this will have an sound effect on the number of cars getting diminished .the public mode of transport being cheaper and safer than cars would provide better option and convenient journey to common man in contrast to the situation now .second , the ever growing fuel prices will force common man to rethink on using personal cars for day to day use .the fuel prices have been sky rocketting and according to the study this pattern would continue for years to come .some may cast doubt on this study by arguing that fewer cars would automatically bring down the demand for fuel and hence price .as a matter of fact , cars are not the only demander of fuel .fuel is used in various industries , airplanes , ships , busses etc .third , the very fact that global economy is doing well is a factor responsible for number of cars present .economy doing well increases the purchasing power of the common man .but this fairy tale might not continue for long .again going by history patern and economic gurus , a slowdown or correction in economy is due and expected to continue for atleast 10 years .this slowdown will automatically bring down the purchasing power of common man as well as the loan providing facilities by financial institutions which has assisted people to buy cars on a rampage .the rate of interest will go higher which will not allow common man to even think of going for the loan .finally , when we talk of economic slowdown , the prices of some essential commodities will surge like that of steel .we all know that steel is major raw material in car manufacturing .now if the raw material cost goes up , it will automatically augment the input cost .hence to increase bottomline on balance sheets , car manufacturers will increase the car prices which will drill holes in common man s pocket .this can be exemplified by recent spur in prices of cars by gm .taking in account the factors stated above , it is crystal clear that reduction in number of cars is inevitable in coming years .
