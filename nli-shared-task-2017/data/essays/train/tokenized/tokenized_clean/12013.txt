nowadays , cars is very important and useful buy the humanity .its an invention who takes animals places and alows us to move anywhere we want in a limited time .but in the future , cars will be used fewer by the humanity .to prove that u  we rare going to based in specfics reasons and examples .in twenty years they will be less and less people who will use cars .scientificaly , the technologie is improving these days so we are supposing to create new engines more useful , more safety and more confortable .for example , as we know there were no cars available to move on the water but with the improving of the new technologie they already created car moving on the water but its not for sale .secondly , since long time many governements are trying to reduce risks of pollution to protect the environment .so one day petrol will be replace by a new invw  ention more safety and secure for the environment and all human being in this planet .finally , as we know soon they will be no petrol in the world so we have to found other solution to replace this strong materiel .in fact we have some cars working with gaz , but the problem that the gaz is putted in the back of the car and its not safe .so when petrol will finished , cars will not be used and also before the patrol gone , it will be very expenssive and only some rish people will buy petrol for their cars .in coclusion , we can say that in the nerly twenty years coming , cars users will reduce slowly and as we proved it technicaly and scientificaly by the world .
