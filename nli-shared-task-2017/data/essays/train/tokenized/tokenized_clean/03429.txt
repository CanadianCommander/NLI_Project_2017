i do nt agree completely with the statement .i do nt believe that in order to be successful people have to take risks or try new experiences .i mean , it would be more correct saying that these kind of people are brave , but i really rather not to use the word `` successful  .let me explain myself : it is extremely complicated to define what does it mean being a successful person , people have such different goals and perspectives in life that there is nt a clear definition of the term !i can feel that i made it or that i am extremely successful for something that maybe would be seen as a total disaster from someone else s view .so , i guess i admire both people who are always trying to make changes or experience new practices , and also , on the other hand , i truly respect those who feel much more confortable and self secure by repeting things they already know .however , i must confess . ..i think i am more a `` new risks every day  type of woman !i love to feel the emotion when i do nt figure out what am i doing or i try all my best when it comes to dealing with new circumstances .so , that is probably another reason why i do nt see as successful people who try new things : because i do nt see myself that way , using the word `` successful  .maybe sometimes i wish i was wiser , more traditional and not afraid of everyday routine !
