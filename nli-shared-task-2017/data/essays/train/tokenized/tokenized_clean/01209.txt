must people try new things and take riks in order to get success ?in my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all days is `` yes  , for the next reasons .first , this is a learning world .i mean , a lot of knownlege and information is produced everyday , so the people who want to sucess they have to be avialable learn new things every day .some reachers are found that the people must chance thier major aor carrer unleast one time in thier life .second , in business are a lot of stories where the people that do nt take a risk and chance , lost a lot of money .besides , the people who innovate has success .examples of that are the transistor in the electronics business and the digital watch , that brings to japan to the first world after the second world war .other contries with more avantage than japon did not want to take the risk .japan did it and now it is the one of the most important economic in the world .also , it is easy to find a lot of personal stories of succes around new tecnologies and internet .yahoo , google and you tube based theirs success in a strange idea , work with out direct pay .so they offer a lot of service like mail , search information and host web page and videos without a recive any pay for that .they people who create the web portal take the risks and everybady know the story they made a los of millons of dollars .in the other hand , for each one of the people that take risk and become a successful people a lot of people fail .so take a risk it is nt a warranty to success .but what i can say is that every successful people had take a risk and try new things .
