have you ever bought any items that you do nt have serious need to use ?if you have experienced this case , it is because of a drastic advertisement .people who live in modern world are members of capitalistic societies .an advertimest has a role of making consumers buy its product .so , i think that advertisements usually make people overestimate the prices of products .it is because of the purpose of advertisements , the models of advertisements , and the indirect feature of advertisements .first of all , i think the purpose of advertisements is the important reason to make people misjudge products .the roles of advertisments are to urge consumer to buy everything the companies sell .in order to fulfill their goals , companies is going to whatever they can do .therefore , most companies merely want to emphasize the good aspect of their products .as a result , products look better than they pratically are .secondly , i believe that the models of advertisements make products look much better .usually , most advertisements tend to hire famous stars , sport players , and any super stars as their models .people can believe whatever super stars say in advertisements because super starts so famous that people regard them as reliable humans .so , using super stars for advertisements is another reason for overestimating .thirdly , it is obvious that people ca nt esimate any products directly by advertisements .through any advertisements , everything look good all the time .however , all aspects of the products are indirect experiences .people ca nt touch , use , smell , hold and even see directly through any advertisements .therefore , it makes products look better to consumers .most people live in capitalistic society .every company wants to make consumer buy their items by its advertisement .because of the purpose of its , the models , and indirect feature of a advertiment , people can overestimate the qualities of products .
