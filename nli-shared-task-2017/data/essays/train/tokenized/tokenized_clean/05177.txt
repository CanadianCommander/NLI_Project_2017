succes is a commum goal of every one .but the definition of success and a successful person differs a lot .some people think that succes is a logical and a natural consequence of a well done job , but others defend the idea that only people who dare could be successful .in my own point of view , i am partially agree with the first statement .in fact , to succed we do not need to be especially smart .and the success of what we do depend rather on the occurancy and the perseverance of our trials than on our willengness to take risk or on our curiosity .we have several examples of success stories of ordinary people that excelled in their traditional jobs and reach fame and wealth by offering their customers a usual products but with better quality .and that relying on their own experience and know-how it means that their success was due to the fact of doing well what they already know how to do .this point of view does not exclude the fact that a lot of people have knew success by taking risks or by tring new things , ways or methods : it is largely admitted that the dare , the courage and the curiosity of pioneers and scientists permitted to the humanity to make great steps in the way of prosperity and developpement .also discoveries and inventions will be impossible without a touch of imagination and risk .in conclusion , i can say that a success is a sweet meal that needs , as ingredients , a bit of risk , a few of curiosity and a lot of know-how and a well done job .
