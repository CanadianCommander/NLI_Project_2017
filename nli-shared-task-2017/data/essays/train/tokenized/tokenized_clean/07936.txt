i agree with this idea , of course you know young people are much more cheerful than elderly people , so young guys have an unlimitede opportunites to do , on the other hand , older people do not have a chances to do such a thing , young people tend to do new things , they are all keen to result in success , what a great life they have , teenagers just like me is full of power and passion , next talking about older people , before i get started , ihave someting tosay .i do not deny elderly people , they are great and everyone looks up to them , but this is our young generation , it is our turn , the good point of older people is they know a lot of things through their lives , they can think about problems better than young people , i mean older people have good knowledge , so young people is not able to defeat older people in a way .however young people have a dream , there are so many things and chances in front o their eyes , the matter is how to get the opportunities .some guys want to be asuper star like smap , the other guys want tobe a great president like a former live door president horie , for older people it is too late to think about their dreams like this , but having a dream is really good , i also have also a dream to master english compeletely , go abroad and become a maneger of suports entertainment , a numer of possiblities are lying around us .i would like tosay to young guys have a big dream , anyting gose , if you believe , you will definetely achive ,
