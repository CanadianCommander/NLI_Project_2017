i agree with the statement .it is because only new things can brings more chances for people to earn more money .doing what is already well-known will just increase the competition of jobs .as a result , the profit will be limited .the more successful running a company , the more successful a person is .nowadays , things change very fast .those people with creative thinking can also earn a lot of money because they can think a lot forward than others .they know what people will need in the future time and they start running a new company about this .when others notice that it is a chance to earn big profit , those clever people have already lead in front .a successful company should have different types of business .if the clever person can lead lots and lots of business in front of others , he will then be very successful .it is because he has already earn a very big profit when other companies are still doing the old things .we say a person is successful becasue he is clever and do something that others can not do .if the clever person does not start a new business , how can others know that the business is also a good chance to earn money .when you do something that follow the other , no matter how good you do , you are still not successful .when a person starts a new business , it is very dangerous because nobody has tried it before .a successful person can success because he knows how to solve the problems and reduce risks .a person fail to start new business is not successful because he cannnot manage the risks .a successful person must try new things and know how to take the risks .in conclusion , people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well are successful .those people are cleverer than others , they can think more forward than others and they can think something that others can not imagine .if a person can do them , he is successful .
