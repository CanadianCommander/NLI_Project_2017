some peple trust the advertisment that is real .sometimes it s not ture in my opinion .soi agree that most advertisements make poducuts seem much better than they really are .i have tow reasons .the first reason why is i do nt belive the comercial on tv .i think some comercial said make a story that it s not ture .for example , i watch the seans about first food .they said that is fresh vegetable and showing big meat .it seems not like a junkfoods .it seems really good apatize .though someday i visited there to eat .unfortunantry , it was not like on tv .it was just humberger .they do nt have a big meat like on tv .moreovre it was not fresh vegetable .i was very frustrated .thus , i do nt want to tust the kind of advertisement .i belive that we need to see before to try some fistfood .and we are supoused to hear a suggestion from before
