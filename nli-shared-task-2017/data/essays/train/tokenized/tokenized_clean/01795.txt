my grandmother often have mentioned like this .`` young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .absolutely , you are not an exception .i agree the statement my grandmother because of the following reasons .first of all , young people like to hang out themselves .in other words , they do not share their thinking and behavior their communities and do not spend time their communities .let s recall `` friends  , the most famous sitcom in the world which there are three women and three guys .during their 20 s and 30 s , they just hang out themselves .i do not see an episodes which above characters have spent the time with their communities .secondly , young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities because they think cyber communites more valuable than real their communities .in my case , i am an active member of korea volunteer teaching program for kids .but i do not know my neighborhoods and their children .owing to technological development and novices , young people are familiar with global issues and internet world and their interest are not limited in thier communities .lastly , i would like say that community it self become more isolated and individual .a hundreds years ago , people depended on each other and they were a huge family .but , there are no dependence , cooperation , respect for senior and original tradition in modern society .to sum up , i agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities for these reaseons ; they do not like spending the time with their communities , they are familiar with cyber comminities than their neighbor and modern society is differerent from past society .
