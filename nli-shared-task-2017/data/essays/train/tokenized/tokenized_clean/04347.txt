try new things and take risks are part of the life of everybody .but in the last time even more successful people are trying to superate the limits .there are more reasons , i will mention only three because of the time .the first one regards the style of life of the successful people .they have a good jobs and also money .they can permit themeselves whatever they want even that they do not need it .money is very dangerous for people .they are sure they can do what they want and when they wnat and sometimes it is the best way to lose the right road .as a second reason there is the fact that if you do every day the same you will be boring with the time .and when people are boring they look for something new and different .sometimes the result of this research can be dangerous and take risks for their proper lives .if a businessman goes free climbing without enough experience only because he is boring in his office he does not take the right decision , because it is a dangerous sport .as third reason the last but not the least , it can happen that people will demonstrate what they can also if they can not and are not able !it is frequent by successful people , i think because they need to feel better than others .this feeling can bring them to do things , what they do not know how to do , only to be and to feel the first one or the best one .in conclusion , i agree with the statement because it is based on my own experience .all the reasons i mentioned are facts i have experienced with people around me .it is not a surprising effect of the society we are living in , but educated and intelligent people shall not do things only to demonstrate something to the others , what unfortunately happens .
