i totally agree with this sentence .attracting a new client is the base of advertising and in a wider meaning of marketing techniques .i graduated in marketing two years ago and the first thing i have been taught during my lessons is that , as a future manager , i would have had to sell the idea of a product not the product itself .this statement , that might sound quite absurd at first sight , has turned out to be very useful in my job .the main reason to support this concept is that a customer , when gets in touch with a product , does not act in a rational way .many researches based on customers purchases have clearly demonstrated that the customer was nt sure of his choice after a few steps he had made out of the shop .this example clarifies how it s not important what a person thinks about a product after she has bought it .the producer must focus his attention on what a customer wants to find in the product .if a person in charge of a marketing department of a company fails to do this , he d hardly be able to sell the product .moreover , as the range of possible items is constantly increasing , advertisements help the customer to do his/her first choice .if a product shows many possible upsides from its use and multiple possible utilisations it will attract a person for sure .the more you exagerate in showing an item , the more you will catch the attention on it .of course , this does nt always works becouse you will always find a segmented target aware of the fact that you are probably hiding something .to sum up , i would say that advertising is an art .something you can not learn .something innate through which you lead people to buy everything you want , but . ..something that can improve a product only in the fantasy of a consumer not in reality .
