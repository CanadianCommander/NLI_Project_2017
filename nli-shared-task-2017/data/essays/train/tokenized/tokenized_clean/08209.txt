people are always trying to achieve success in their lives .no everyone will be a successful person because it might involve many personal characterists .i really agree that a successful person is someone who tries new things and takes risks .jason , a friend of mine , is a good example of a person who tries new things .jason was unhappy with what he was doing in his job , then he decided to quit it and open his own bussiness .for many years he saved his money and after last summer he decided to run his own office .he oppened a new kind of drug-store that i have never seen before .his clients buy medication over the phone without having to leave their house , everything is done over the phoner or via email and all merchandise are delivered at people s door .jason has been so successful with this new bussiness that he is thinking about to open another drug-store .he made last month more than three thousand dollars .a successful person is someone who takes risks .maria , my friend from my medical school , is another good example of a successful person .she graduated as a doctor in 1995 and since there she actuelly never worked as a doctor .instead , she prefered to run her own company .she started selling medical equipments to big hospital and started importing medical supplies from united states .she took a huge risk on her hands by leaving a career as a doctor to become a simple seller is a big risk , but she didnt care about it .now she manager the biggest medical supply company in south america and she became a rich and prosper bussiness woman .to sum up , being a successful person in life requires some particular personal characteristics .a successful person is someone who things about new ideas and makes this ideas work , but not only that , a successful person is also someone who takes risks even this can ruin his/her intire life .
