for me , i would agree to join a group that led by a tour guide ; however , to travel by ourselves in an unknown plave in very dangerous and will spend lots of money .let s imagine a condition .if we travel to an unknown place with only a map and confused by it , will we have a lot of fun in that place ?i think everyone s answer is no .we can not just visit an unknown place on foot ; we should drive a car .if we miss the direction , we have to keep driving and spend lots of money for the oil .without the help of the tour guide , we might live in an expensive hotel .if there is something we do not understand about the landscapes , there is no one we can ask , and it is not easy to ask a stranger .once we meet the dangers such as medical care , it will be very hard to seek the volunteers who can help us .if there is a tour guide , we can visit the place , which in the place we do not even know before , with happy heart and good consulors .we do not need to bring a map becuase the tour guide is our map .we do not need to walk or drive the car and spend the oil money ; we will have a comfortable bus and pay only a small amout of money for it .we will not have any questions about the landscapes becuase the tour guide will be a teacher .if we have dangers , the tour guide will find a way as soon as possible to solve it .in conclusion , even though travel just by ourselves can make us have more freedom and time , but we will also bring anything that is uncertain with us , such as car accidents and miss the way to go .we all sure want the happiness and peace with us when we are traveling , but without a good helper , everything will happen easily .if there is a good helper when we are traveling , we do not need to worry much about everything becuase the tour guide can led us to the happiness and peace .although we have to pay the money to the tour guide , but the most important is the safety and a nice spirit in a trip .
