academicians are often faced with the dilemma of either specializing in their core area of research or to study , learn , and eventually be productive in a variety of subjects .needless to say there are advantages and disadvantages of both approaches .usually , a doctoral student completes his/her dissertation focusing on one topic and investigating the issue in detail .the chapters of the dissertation may look at the problem from different perspectives , but the main theme is the same .after graduation , the student hopefully finds an academic position and turns the chapters into independent articles and has them published at academic journals .after that , whether to continue in the same area or branch into different areas does become the choice of the academician .focusing on the same specific area of research will make the academician an expert in that field .if the reseach area is fertile , the publication record will be impressive .s/he will get tenure quite easily and will be a respected member of academic circles .however , at some point , the academician will be isolated .s/he will no longer have the possibility of venturing into joint projects with others .moreover , if interest in that particular area of research eventually fades away , s/he will lose popularity , the career will be faced with the possibility of obscurity , and it will be extremely difficult for her/him to move into other research areas at that point .on the other hand , keeping a balance of conducting research in the main area of interest and branching into other subject areas will make the career of a researcher more durable .the natural way to do research in other areas is to have co-authors , whose talents can be combined with those of the researcher .as knowledge increases in a geometric fashion in today s world , it becomes more and more difficult to master a topic by oneself .researchers are forced to develop joint projects with others .moreover , the quality and the efficiency of research production will increase with joint projects .establishing connections with other researchers will open the door for new projects with other researchers .as a matter of fact , this is the trend in many areas of academia .in finance , for example , the majority of the articles that are published in good quality journals have multiple authors .learning is the lifelong ambition of an academician .this is best achieved by branching into and learning about other subjects , establishing connections with researchers in those areas and developing projects by sharing knowledge in a reciprocal manner .
