i think that in twenty years there will actually be fewer cars than there are now .in this essay , i will explain the reasons why i think this will happen .the main reason for my views is the increasing price of gas .we have seen that the petrolium prices have gone through the roof recently .in the last three years , they have more than doubled .the fuel efficieny of cars has more or less been stagnant in the last couple of decades .it is reasonable to assume fuel efficiency will not be able to offset the rising prices .at this rate , it will be prohibitively expensive to drive a car , and people will prefer public modes of transport such as buses and metros .another reason is that more and more people are becoming aware of the pollution caused by cars .people are increasingly concerned about their environment , and are taking steps to maintain it .in denmark for example , an increasing number of people are using bicycles rather than cars .taking a cue , other europeans have started adopting these steps .this trend is likely to spread well beyond europe , into america and other continents .cars make people lazy .as people become more health conscious , they will stop using cars , and use more healthy ways of transport such as cycling or biking .they may also prefer to walk if the distance is short .with the advances in aviation industry , it is becoming increasingly affordable to travel by air .if we can extrapolate this , travel by air may in fact become cheaper than travel by cars in another twenty years .in that case people are highly likely to stop using cars .in conclusion , it is more likely than not that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now .this is supported by present conditions as well as past experience .
