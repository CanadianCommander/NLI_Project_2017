do young people nowadays do nt spent enough time in helping their communities ?i strongly agree with the speaker in few points .first of all , the youth nowadays simply do not have to help their communities because of they lack the interest of their communities .because of the arise of the individualism they now focus on their own self-interest and happiness .we now see alot of young people just enjoying their lifes or prparing for their future carreers .they do nt have time to look after their communities or those who are sick and poor .many of them just simply enjoy going to parties and get drunk and give their time in making girl-or-boy friends .second , the young nowadays do nt have time to help and participate in helping their communities even though they are interested in helping others .they are unfortuantley caught up in their school s study or assignment in order to survive in our over competivive society .they get up early in the morning for school and they might attend after school activity or academic insitutions that will help their courses .many young student work in a part-time job to finance their tuition and board .lastly , even though some students do spend some time in helping their communities , it is not a long term participation but becoming more of an one time event without enthusiasim or passion .because of the economic growth and increased the notion of quaility of life , they do nt feel the real need to help others who are disadvataged .they were hardly never in a situation when they hungry without food and with no place to sleep .this might be a reason for them to actually not to have some sympathy towards helping others which might make them less active .in sum , because of the reasons stated above i strongly think that the youth nowadays lack time , interest and effort in a long-term activity in helping their communuities .
