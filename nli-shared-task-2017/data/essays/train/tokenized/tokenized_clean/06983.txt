the teachers teach us alof of different things .they always teach us that to understanding the idea and the concepts of each article is more important than to learn the facts .even thought we are the students or the teachers .first , understanding to ideas and the concepts is to make sure that you know everything of this story or article .if you do not understand what it talk about , you would never get the the fact of it .my english teacher always says that way to me .if we want to learn the good english , we should read it more than one time to understand the idea .it likes the chacater , setting , plot , and the background .when we can get all of the above , we would understand the ideas and the concepts .trying to read it more than one time , it would more easy to get what it says in the reading .i always do that way , because i want to get higher marks of every test or quiz .when we do that , we will learn more when we read .leaning the facts is not really a bad thing to lean .it depends on different people to learn .everyone also has it s own way to learn .we wo nt learn or follow the others step .everyone is different .no one is the same .learning the facts is another way for learning .actually , learning the facts is almost at the end of the learning step .if we spread it out , we would know that the first step of reading is to understand the ideas , and then it should be to learn the concepts .after this two steps , it s to learn the facts .although there has a lot of different ways to learn , i still would think the most important for the students to understand ideas and the concepts .that s because that s the only way that my teachers teach me since i have been studying .
