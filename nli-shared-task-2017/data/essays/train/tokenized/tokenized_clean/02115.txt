travelling alone or with group will depends on ones personality and travelling habits .i have more positive experiences in travelling with group than travelling alone .so i like to travel with grouple led by a tour guide .travel with group is more stress free , organized , safe and less expensice .usually for group travelling , one will take care of the tickets booking , hotels reservation etc. group will decide when its time to start , which place is nice to stay .so i do nt need to worry about these things and can enjoy the trip with out any stress .last year , i visited india with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip was stress free .my group leader organized travelling and reservations and my tour guide take me to all the important places .guide will take the group and show everything that group need to see in that area .in this way , i do nt need to spend my whole evening planning for next day events .this is so time saving .this way , i can concentrate on other things like enjoy my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meet new friend in the party etc .group travel is more safe .all ways you have some one along with you and take care of you if needed .it is easy for you to recover from sickness since somebody is taking care of you .especially with long trips , if you are sick in the trip and you travel alone then it is very hard to recover from the sickness .since all the expences are shared among the group members , i will pay less money than i pay , if i travel alone .i strongly belive that travelling with group led by a tour guide will give more stress free trip in an organized fashion with less money and more safty .
