i do not agree with the statement because i think that , at least in the country i live in and for the experiences i had , young people give aid to the communities in fields where the state has not enough money to do everything it s supposed to .i m not that old , so i can not tell exactly how it was in the past , but today i can tell that also if society is getting every day more individualistic and selfish , people take care of the persons in need and try to help them as much as they can .many volunteer organizations have grown up in the city i live since i came here eight yers ago , and most of the volunteers are young : they mostly act in welfare , providing food to poor people and covers during the winter time .it s true that it s not the majority of the population , but i know a lot of people ( and i am one of these ) that spend part of the week trying to do something good for others in their own cities .many people goes far in the world , like in third world countries , to help people there , but sometimes does nt realize that just in the neighborhood next to their house there is somebody who needs the same kind of help .but welfare is not the only field : volunteer organizations have born also to help the state preserving the huge cultural heritage of italy , giving a fundamental help when an earthquake damaged the central part of the country , preventing the loss of incredible art treasures .i think that most of the things i exposed are done by young people because most of them are still dreamers and feel better acting like this .they are usually more enthusiastic and to them it s not enough to just give money for charity .
