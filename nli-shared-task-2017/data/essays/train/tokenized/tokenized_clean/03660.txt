the problem of knowing if being a risk taker or limiting yourself to do what you re good at to be successful is complex and controversial .while some people might argue that risks are likely to lead to failure , i would say that major successes have often been the results of creative and risky initiatives .i believe that innovative thinking as well as risk taking persons are more likely to obtain huge successes .if you do only what you re good at , you generally do nt create new ideas nor products but you just execute something that has been already done .being efficient may make you the best in your field and procure you some relative success .in my opinion , having a comfortable living situation does not necessarly means success .in fact , success would be illustrated by more outstanding success stories , like the ones which came from a completly new concept .this point can be illustrated by the example of the company google .to start a new company is a challenge itself that can lead to failure .in the google s case , building a very efficient search engine and believing that it can be profitable through advertising was a completly new and innovative concept .financial risks related to the investment were important .investors had to be willing to take risks in a situation where we had no history nor statistics to anticipate success .however , google managed to be successful to the point where every employee gained a lot of money thanks to the enterprise success .even the cafeteria chef s stock options were multiplied by more than one hundred between the time he joined google and now !i do nt believe we have seen such a growth in other new companies for the last years .today , we can definitely measure that the risk was really important as we know that a lot of companies that emerged from the internet bubble went bankrupt .also , we can realize that google s innovative thinking as well as their will to take risks enabled his creators to have the success they have today .
