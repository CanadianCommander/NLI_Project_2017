who have not been complaining about how boring are sometimes the topics and contents of courses ?the ones who will not agree have never been students or have certainly erased this part of their life from their memory .even if iideas and concepts are key elements in learning , i am a student in law and the professors that i have loved are the ones who have made me like some topics i was not supposed to appreciate .and their secret is they have kept our attention by not only sustainable analysis but also by relevant facts which are part of our everyday life .first , ideas and theories are too vague for basing students .they are far beyond of ourselves .that is why using a concept without an example is completely nonsense and ridiculous .that is why , teachers from the elememtary school to universities are using examples to make one of their sutudent understand one idea he has not .so , ideas how clever they might be are pointless if we can not verify it regarding situations .in a second matter , a certain kind of concepts are really difficult to understand .for instance , some arguments of philosophers must appear far-fetched at first sight .as a consequence to sustain their ideas philosophers use historical events or everyday lifeor biological situations .hegel shows the competition relations between men by a comparison with animals .facts are a way to learn and understand more efficiently theories and concepts .facts are more attractive than theorical ideas > they are more tangible and theories can be verified by that way .in fact , communism theories have been their pre-conceved economic ideas questionned by facts .and liberalism theories have been successfull regrding history .as a result , facts are more efficient than concepts and ideas as they can show their negative consequences .in a nutshell , facts are essential in a pedagogic method or to examine theories regarding their effciency .but theories sseem to be very important as facts are the tools to critize them .in fact , what would be the use of facts if there were no concepts and ideas at all .
