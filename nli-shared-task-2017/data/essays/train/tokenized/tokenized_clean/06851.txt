i do not aggree with this statement .there several reasons explained in the analysis below which will indicate the opposite .first of all , the historic development of the automotive industry has to be taken into account .in the last 30 years the number of cars sold worldwide increased year after year .in western europe an the united staates the number of sold cars might not have increased at the same speed it did in the 1980s or 1990 , but it still has been growing .furthermore , the statement claims that the total number , not the number of sold cars , will be reduced .that means that people whose cars are demaged will not buy new cars , which certainly is unrealistic .emerging countries like china and india and also countries in eastern europe seem to develop the same way countries in western europe and the u.s. have a few years ago .therefore , the demand for cars in those countries will rise year after year .when anayzing the location of production sites of the automotive industrie it is obvious that they currently focus on these countries .this shows that they expect to sell huge a amount of cars in those areas .other countries in africa have not even started to develop to an industrial country .in 20 years those countries will properbly have began their development and consequently their need for cars will have increased .the growing population in the develloping countries and in the whole world will go hand in hand with the growing number of cars .at the moment the importance of the environment becomes obvious to people in developed countries like germany .this might make people think that the number of cars will be reduced .but , the conclusion that the will stop buying cars is wrong .it is possible to invent environmental friendly cars which only need a little amount of gas .at the same time the first prototypes of cars using differnent materials than gas have been develloped .this gives people the opportunity to drive a car and to protect the environment .the argumentation above shows that it is very unlikely that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .
