in my opinion trying new things that you never did before is the apportunity to have more chance to succeed .because people would know what they are good at by trying .it is very important to know what you can do well and also you can enjoyas an example , i used to play the piano when i was young .and i always thought that i was good at playing piano and it would be my career in the future .but as i grew up , i experienced that i lost the interest and the joy from playing the piano .after that , i started to learn playing the violin for a year .but it was only interesting at first several months .then i started to take an art class in school .i used to draw and paint when i was young , but this time i felt the passion and joy from it .now i look forward to attend in art school .the several art awards that i received are always making me to think learning new things are so important .although i already decided to study more about art and work in art industry , i try to learn new things to improve myself and for my future .i learnd tae kwon do two years ago and i try to meet as many people as i can from volunteer works to understand different kind of people and their cultures .also i joined many clubs in school that i want to do .i think successful people try and learn new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .it is like to explore yourself what you are capable of .also i believe that the trying many things will become your valuble experiences and knowledges to make you successful and it will be also very helpful for your life .
