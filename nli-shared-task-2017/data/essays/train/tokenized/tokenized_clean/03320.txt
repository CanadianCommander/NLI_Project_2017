succeeding in life looks rather like a controversial question .on the one hand , it is widely admitted that people taking risks are awarded .it is true that when a person is taking a risk , it can helps him to succed .on the other hand , it is also admitted that when you know how to do something well , you can succeed .i would rather think that it is a combination of these two elements that makes you successful .first , if someone is taking risks , it is obvious that the person will have to be concerned .this means that a person will rather take some risks if he has skills on a topic or on a matter .this statement can be highlighted especially in a professionnal context .indeed , in this particular context , taking risks can be innovating and trying to get a product well known from everyone .if we consider this situation , the person is taking risks due to financial matters .so , it seems obvious that the person must be aware of what he is doing .therfore , takimg risk and knowing to do well something are not contradictory , in order to be successful .however , it can happened that you are taking risks in everyday life .it is true that it can helps people to have more opportunities .according to this , taking risks even when rationality would tell us not to something could certainly help us to succeed .if someone is narrowminded and not open to learn new things , then it seems more likely that the person will have less chance to succed .finally , we could also say that as the notion of success can be different fro ; one person to another , this statement is subjective .indeed , any definition of being successful is given .success can rise in different situation .for instance , some people can think that success means success in professionnal life .but , other people could say that you succeed when you have a family .to sum up , both sides of the statement could be defended .i think that a combination of taking risks and knowing how to do things well is mandatory to succeed .
