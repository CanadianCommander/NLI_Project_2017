i personally would nt agree with that statement for few reasons .first of all , young people , sometimes , enjoy life in a very stupid way , not taking into account the results and sequenses , while older people usually have more wisodm that younger people .it is hard to argue about this topic for a simple reason .since we have to consider different point of vews , `` enjoying life  have so many different meanings .for instance , a priest might be enjoying his life with no wife or children , stuck in his house and the church in what might be enjoyable for him .other people might be enjoying their life by addicting to drugs and smoking .i might not seem vey right for me , but that s the fun of life for other people .so what i am trying to say here is that it is important and crucial to know and interpret what does enjoying life mean .another thing here is that we have to take the circumstances .for example , if i am living in a country of people .in the simplest case senario , let s see how people in different regoins on earth are living .i don not think that young people in poor countries of africa or in iraq are enjoying themselves ver much .if we now compare those young people to older people living a better life , them i can assure you that those older people , having a better taste of life , are enjoying themsleves much more that young people .i know that i was supposed to discuss the statement it self , but according to the information given , i could nt tell who is going to enjoy life more .the statement does not tell the circumistances of people , so at the end i will ask you this question  ; who is going to enjoy life more ?is it misrable young people or old peple riding fasny cars , living in million dollar houses ?
