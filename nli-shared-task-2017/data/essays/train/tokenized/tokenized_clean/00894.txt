do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?maybe some people nowadays do not realize the importance of communities , however , i think people can not survive when isolate themselves from the crowd , because poeple need helps from other people .so in my opinion , i totally agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because they do nt understand helping other people is vital in the society .and here is my supporting reasons as follow .firstly , i think it is an excuse that young people do nt have enough time to help , because they spend too much time not only in studying but also in playing , and they do nt pay attention to the environment they llive in .they should discover that here are many helps from communities like there are always some people who give help to clean up the trash .the second point i want to express is perhaps there are some young people do know that helping their communities is necessary , however they just do nt have time to give .then , i think they should know how to schedule their time , and to use their time well .to sum up , in my personal opinion , i think all people , including old and young people , should give enough time to helping their communities , because people always give help to each other .i hope young people can understand that point of view , and contribute their time to their communities , and then make their communities much better .
