i agree with this statement .as improvement or development of technology , every house has their own televisions and radio .and also internet used as a good way of advertising some products .but since the purpose of advertising is selling the products what the company made , when they advertise one product , they overly exaggerate that product .when i was in elementary school , i was walking on the road .i saw one person advertising a fan .what i heard was they are selling fans only that day with 50 percent discount .and he kept saying that it never breaks and he used that fan for last few years .but when i bought that fan it broke in a week .and one another day i ways watching television .and when i watched one commercial which was advertising diet food .and they were saying that , `` if you eat this diet food for a month you will be like one of the hollywood stars.  and after few weeks i saw one article in the internet which was talking about that diet food does nt work well .people do nt buy products which does nt look or seems good .every day people want better and better products .so the company automatically try to show their product is better than other company s product .in the advertisement they always talking about the good thing of their product they never says that the bad thing of their products .so people might think that the product is really good so they should buy it .advertisement is a important bussiness .it s a only way to company introduce it s goods to everybody .but since there are so many companies are in this world .they stated competing each other and try to exaggerate their product than the other company s product .so i think the products seems much better than they really are is because of that s the way to survive in this world .
