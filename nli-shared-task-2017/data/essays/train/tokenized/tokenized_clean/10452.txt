environmental issues and sustainable development are and become more and more fashion everyday .some politicians try to make those questions unavoidable .for instance , al gore in the united states , ( ex-vice president under clinton s administration ) who s releasing a movie on global warming ; or to a lesser extent , in france where some intellectuals would like to talk about the subject in the scope of the next elections .in this oultook , in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?will they even disappear ?i do nt think so .our current world lives under the influence of globalization .means of communication , physical or virtual , are playing more and more a sizeable role in our daily lives .we build everyday bridges , motorways , we create networks through internet optic wires all over the world .we live in a logistical world if i can put it this way .in this context , i hardly imagine the end of cars , or the decrease in car numbers , which is surely the best mean of transport for all the citizens .futhermore , the emerging markets consume more and more cars and all cars manufacturers already produce millions of cars for chinese people or indian people .in twenty years , we will not ` bury  the car but , this latter will certainly take other forms , a form that will less jeopardize the planet .i think about brazilian cars that are already hybrid cars .nevertheless , let s not forget that more than 80 per cent of the population is urban .and , this major trend will go on .all the cities are already totally overcrowded by cars , full of congestions .all the cities try to limit the number of cars .london has even implemented a tax to prevent people from driving in the city .in this context , we can think that in twenty years the numbers of cars will decrease .thus , clean public transport or even bikes or motorcycles will know a revival , will be born again .it s conceivable .therefore , which of these two trends will prevail ?i hope the second one . ..
