learning facts is an event that will be discovered as a result of applying ideas and concepts .in order for a student to learn facts , he should first have to understand the main ideas and concepts than to know the results of this ideas and concepts .generally speaking , both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts have several advantages .firstly , understanding ideas and concepts have several advantages .the first advantage of understanding ideas and concepts is the improvement in the ability of students to think and develop .this means that when students learn the fact only without thinking of the main ideas and the concepts of this fact , they will never try to develop and improve these ideas or concepts .as a result , there will not going to be any innovations from any kind .another advantage of understanding ideas and concepts is the discovery of new facts .this means that maybe some facts that result as a consequenses of ideas an concept are not the only fact that exist maybe other facts result from the same ideas and concepts .these are few advantage from understanding ideas and concepts .secondly , learning facts directly also have several advantages .the main advantage of learning facts is that sometimes facts are not based on any ideas or concepts .learning facts directly in this case will be more convinient for students .another advantage of learning facts instead of understanding ideas and concepts is that the students do nt have to worry about where did this come from .and this is the most annoying question in my opinion .i think that these are the few advantage of learning facts directly .to summarize , i think that it is better for students to understand ideas and concepts in order to improve these facts but in sometimes it is enough for them to learn the facts directly .
