i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in our life the advertisements are almost everywhere , you can see them on newspaper , tv , wall , car and subway .when you see the products on them , the products look so nice .everyone want to buy them , but when you got them , they did not seem better than advertisements .the frist reason that i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for example some advertisements on tv , they look so nice , so people will to buy these products , when they got the products , but it is not so good .thus some people will make more money .the second reason that i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , most advertisements are made by a lot people .they know how to make products better than they are really .so people like to buy them .the third resaon that i think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , some products do not really good , if they do not make the advertusements better they will sale a few .so people spend more money on the advertusements so they can sale more products , they will make more money than before .successfully when we know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .we can buy some products that we really need .do not buy those products seem better on the advertisements .so i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
