in my view , this statement is half-true .success does nt releave from only one factor .it often depends on external conditions which one ca nt control .anyway , innovation is a good way to approach it , but it regularly must be based on things we know to do well .being enterprising and trying new things can be a real advantage for developing a project .in the economic field , the most successful people are the ones who took risks presenting new idea .for example , the big boss of apple became a millionnaire developing a small new computer .moreover , trying new things makes the technology progress .the problem is that not anyone is capable of brilliants ideas .we always think of successful entreprising people , but we should ask ourselves how many people who took risks really got glory .what about the persons who invest thousands of dollars in projects who turned to be desasters ?the ideas that collapsed were nt all bad or stupid .sometimes a great innovation just do nt come at the good time .bright ideas in 1928 were made to failled because of the crisis coming the year after .i would like to stress another point .it is not enough to try new things and take risks to find success .the best way of being able to build a new thing is to be an expert in his discipline .continuing doing what we know to do well can lead us to imagine what could be done better , what is missing .to conclude , success happens when one act whitjkl
