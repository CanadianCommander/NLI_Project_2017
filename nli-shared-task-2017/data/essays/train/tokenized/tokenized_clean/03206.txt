to answers to the question `` do advertisements exaggracete the products ?  may change from person to person .so , people have different opinions about most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not .i strongly support the this opinion .from today s point of view , i can list many reasons for that .firstly , advertisements aim lot of sales .producers produce the their products to earning money .last year i saw very big advertisement about computer on the television and i bought one .but i do not like it .because advertisement said that this computer is incredible fast , you could not find faster one .but i recognize that it was really slow after i use it .i want to refuse this computer , but company said that we can pay just half price to you .secondly , to sell the any product is difficult .because generally people do not want to spend more money .people have some difficulties about future and they tend to accumulation .for this reason , producers need an exaggracete advertisement .indeed , there is the exaggarecete in the advertisement habitat .in addition to what i have mentioned before , i should say that advertisements is needed for people .if there is no advertisements , people do not find product which they need .advertisements help to people that decide to which product should buy .on the other hand some times advertisements cause the really good product .for example one company sell its product with big advertisement .so , people think about these product is good .if the product do not really good , people should hear this situation and sales are decrease and then accompany will lose .so , company want to produce good product .while i can say advertisements make products seem much better than they realy are , i can not say whole products are worst than they really are .some products which produce from well-known mark are really good .i tried to explain the reasons of my opinion .all of these are the reasons why i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
