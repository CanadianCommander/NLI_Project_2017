i agree to the opinion of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than restricing yourself of having knowledge of a specific field of interest and area .i believe that one should be well informed and aware of whats happening outside his domain and specialisation .its primarily because of three reasons : - a )competitiveness : -the society we live in is a very competitive society . .so when you are not well informed about whats happening outside your field of interest ; then you are seriously in trouble and indeed are lacking behind people who have a competitive edge over you .ex : - being a software engineer ; if you dont have the knowledge of whats happening in the hardware industry or for that matter in the electronics industry in general ; then you might not be able to keep up with the information on latest gizmos and technology .moreover others would have a competitive edge over you .b )uncertainity : -the second reason is uncertainity of the current field you are specializing to sustain itself ; say 15 years down the line .if you are talking about a technolgy which is being used now ; there is no guarantee that it would be there after few more years .ex : - everyone is behind java and some other programming languages . .now no one is sure that java is going to be there in the future ; say five years down the line .so its better to have a backup plan ready for now wherein you are constantly updating yourself with other subjects .c )organisational needs or industry requirements : -now-a-days large organisations do offer interdepartmental transfers by cross-training on different products thus giving a chance for the employess to move on to a different vertical altogether . .if you are just informed about a specific field and are resistant against the inter-departmental transfers .it can really hamper your chances of moving up the ladder in the corporate field .thus i believe that you need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just a mere specialisation . .
