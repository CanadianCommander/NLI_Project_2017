city born and city bred , i have long been accustomed to the sight of passing vehicles .now that i , as an engineerer , have more oppurtunies to observe the hallmark in the history of invention and have noticed any sign , at any moment for the time being , the fall and decline of cars .they are in radical demand in a number of rising countries and technology advancements empower them the novel vitality .among contemporary powers , us , japan and western europe , the more cars people possess , the more is needed for the simple reason the refinements , replacements must be done over two decades and the thriving marketting of new styles stimulate the need while average income of people in these regions grant the desire .let s go a step further into the rising nations , china , india .a bief glance at the strenuos road building craze will dispell any douts on the pressing demand of cars .some people suspect they , as well as americans , japanese and europeans will be concerned on environmental issue .more often than not , the majority , especially in developping countries will consider the properous automobile industry and other areas which have some bearing on it the priority .however , countries that are sufficiently technologicall prepared may take sturdy steps to update , instead of abandoning the car .as far as i can see , automobile is such an indispemsable element of western culture that deserting the car is equivalent to disposing the contention in freedom .cars embody the culture of fully controlling one s life and the significant sign of being entitled to pursuing the personal aspiration .hence , i definitely believe the recession of cars will not occur at least in the near future , so close as twenty years .but one thing is certain , that automobiles will take on a more fantastic appearance to gratify the aesthetic appetite of consumers and adopt more features , say , automatic navigating , hydrogen fueled to be friendly .the possible massive possession of cars in developing country in twenty years is approximately written in stone .
