nowadays , some people think that it is more important to understand ideas and conceps than it is to learn facts .as far as i am concerned , i think it should be better to learn facts especially for students .in the following lines , i will developp my point of view .firstly , ideas and conceps are not always true .they can often be based for example on myth or on rumors .in that way , if students fixe on an idea or a concept that is not true their education may not be right .that is it is important for students to learn facts .because by learning facts , they can discovering by themself that what they are learning is true .they will first start by a statement or a situation , analyse it and find why it is in that way .secondly , learning facts is more adapted in an academic environment .thirdly , learning in facts provide more informations to students than learning ideas or concepts .for example , a concept is something that is already stated and your professor would only explain it to you .but if you learn facts , you will have certainly informatins from your professor but also you will get your own new informations due to your discoveries .to conclude , i can assert that learning facts in better for students than learning ideas or concepts because it provides more advantages to students .
