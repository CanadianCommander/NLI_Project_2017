nowaday , rich and poor gaps in the society is getting wider and wider in around of the world .i agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather that only doing what they already know how to do well .there are several reasons for it .first , people who works on doing what they already known how to do well could get uniform money and can be succesful people as well but i think it is not really successful people .i think real successful people is a peson who made huge money and everyone would agree that person is successful person .second , it could be risky but try new things is more chances to be successful people .for example , bill gates , he was a normal bussiness man with normal salary .but he tried new thing to earn more money to be a successful people by making the first computer and the micro-software .by this product , bill gates made huge effects on information technology to the world and earn tons of money .from thoses reasons , i think people should take risks and try new things to be successful people .
