i agree that it s more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .because learning ideas and concepts is easy to access the facts than learning just facts alone .for example , let s ausum that the teacher explain the chord of music .the fact is that the term of auggmented traid .in this case , teacher said just that defination of the triad .the teacher said that it is composed of two major chord .so i think most of the student do nt understand that term .but rather than facts , teacher might explain using principle of that chord throughout the playing the piano .teacher make student hear the compose of the cord .then most of the student understand more effectively .second , understanding ideas and concepts is not taken away from brain recognation .understanding simply facts is tend to get away from the recognation .because there is no logical thing and relevant with the other principle of the fact .third .understandig ideas and principle of facts is more likely to trensfer the other subject .because foundation of the fact is more important than it s own facts .for example , once learning a principle of triad , then student can make any kind of triad and chord in basic of ideas of preiveous learning chord .to sum it up , accoding to above reasons , iearning concepts and principle of the facts is more important than learning facts alone .
