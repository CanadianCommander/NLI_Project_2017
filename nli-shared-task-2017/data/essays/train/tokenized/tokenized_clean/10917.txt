nowadays , most companies if not all of them , rely on advertisement to make a certain product or object known and valuable .they actually use the advertisement to compete with other companies and sell more .however , are the advertisements the real image of what products really are , and how much they cost ?unfortunately , most customers are getting a `` disappointed  feeling when buying a certain product , or after having bought it .for example , when we see an advertisement about a car , the price is usually without taxes , and without any options .however , when the customer sees the panel , he would get excited about the price meeting his own budget .so he would go and prepare his savings and tell everyone about it .then , when buying the car , the company would tell him :  excuse me sir , do you need it with an automatic transmission ?do you want the windows to be electrically controlled ?and with every question coming , the customer s smile would give place to a sarcastic and fake smile , that would totally disappear with : `` excuse me sir , this price was without taxes .now , can the customer change his mind after the price increased by a couple of thousands of dollars ?it s not that easy , after having sold his own car , for example , and having told everyone about the new vehicle he was going to buy .on the other side , some companies have the option to refund their customers if they are nt satisfied about the product .however , how many customers will actually have the time to go and ask for a refund about his product ?in addition , will it be a total refund ?in most cases it is not .they would try to sell you another product instead of the older one .finally , we can realise nowadays that most of what we see on televisions and panels is nt true .`` lying  to people will actually make companies lose on the long run , because a disappointed customer will not come back .therefore , every company is in a dilemna between `` showing off  and losing on the long run , and giving the world the real image of their products .
