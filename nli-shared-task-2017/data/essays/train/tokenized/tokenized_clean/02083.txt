i did nt agree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.  why means it was a known fact that `` knowing every tthing about something is better than knowing something about everything.  and also it causes poor knowledge in the fild an individual has to be choosen for sustainment .it will be clearly dicussed in the following lines .firstly , what a person needs is that the term `` profficiency  .because it would be the thing that the modern world needs .every field needs the people to be profficient in that field and a little or no knowledge in other fields .even the most famous scientists whose inventions may stick to thir feild .so every individual needs himself to be expertise in any particular choosen field .moreover the former would gives him a lot of confusion towards the respective fields .secondly , the process of broadening causes a lot of unemployment apart from developing inadequacy in the theories pertaining to his own field .on the other hand it gives a sort of uselessness to him in his career objectives .ofcourse it gives the broad knowledge to the individual , it creates a lot of disaster to his family members and also to the country .nextly , knowledge of many academic subjects may cause loss of individuality .moreover the development of any field depends upon the effective utilisation of the sources and their research in those fields .what it means is that the person needs to show his attitude and concentration for the development of the selected subject .because in the era of rapid growing technology the individual may get his identity only in his specialized field .finally , for the overall development and for the well-being of the individual , one needs specialization in his respective field .this gives him ability to promote his identity even in the most unfavorable situations .
