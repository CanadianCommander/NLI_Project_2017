some people say that the youngsters do nt have any interests in helping their communities any more but grabbing their own ambitions , while others argue that the young of these days are more motivated to give help for their communities .considering the growing passions of young valenteers , however , i strongly desagree with the statement written above .for the first , there are social advantages which encourage the youngsters to help their communities .in specific , since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world , such as skills needed for processing certain job , taking part in local activities does nt mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more .for instance , i once took part in local festival as an staff .as there are so many foreigners who visited in my community , all i should do was rushing here and there , giving free interpretation .even though it was tough and didt provide me any money , i could more valuable things through that event , improvement in my english interpretation , and social skills .on top of that , the youngsters nowadays are tend to dedicate themselves for what they put their values on .according to the department of labor of korea , in 2005 , more than 60 % of colleage students have experiences of valenteering in their local needs .what is more , they stated that what they wanted to acquire through their activities was not money but their self improvement .this case clearly represent the fact that they are now put their values on not only material things but also the mental things .there is an old korean saying goes like this ; helping neighbors is as valuable as helping one s own siblings .this represent the idea that giving one s hand for others need is a kind of qualification to be an well rounded person .thus , as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one s hand for their comunities exist , the active participation of youngsters will never be limited .
