as a graduate , i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .specializing in one subject gives you a chance to read the subject in depth , gives you ample opportunity to undertake research on the selected subject and will also let you focus on learning specific skills that will compliment your chosen profession .by specializing in one subject , you can learn that subject in depth .for example , i have done my bachelor s in physical therapy .i have a general idea about all the specialities like orthopedics , neurology , cario-respiratory , pediatrics to name a few .but my real interest is in geriatrics which is just a part of a course curriculum .it does not deal the subject in depth .if i decide to study this subject , i will not only learn the generalities of it but also the unique features of this speciality .things like what kind of exercises suit better , how frequently should the sessions be administerd , what are the special things to be kept in mind during the therapy sessions and also about the psychological aspects .so as i said it gives you an in-depth knowledge about a subject .secondly , you get enough time and also ample opportunity to work on a research .when you take up a single subject , you concentration is centered on the subject .you do nt have distractions like lots of assaignments to do , term papers to submit , multiple exams to give .so you have lots of time in your hand to concentrate only the selected subject .you can also do some research work , like for example , what is the effect of ultra-sound therapy on back pain in older people .is it the same as in the adults ?finally , the skills .you can learn new skills that will compliment your profession .for example , i know manipulations of different types , that will help in the treatment of joint problems .but will these manipulations help the older people .will they be effective on them or cause more harm .if they are not useful , then that means that i have to learn some alternative skills that will help them better . .this is one such example .i may learn yoga , because it is very safe and effective .i will learn those skills that more gentle and more effective , specifically suiting the old people .to conclude , i can say i like to specilaize in one subject because i am a graduate .this does not mean that studying many academic subjects is not good .it is the best if you are an undergraduate .you get to know the different subjects and what they deal with .you can also decide as to which subject is more interesting to you and suits you and decide upon your carrer .studying many academic subjects has got its own advantages but they do nt suit my needs as i have already passed that part of my life and settled into a profession .all i need now is to study the subject of my interst and specialize in it .
