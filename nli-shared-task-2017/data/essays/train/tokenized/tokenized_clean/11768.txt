there always occurs some disagreements between young people and old people everytime and everywhere in the world regardless of their citizenship and region .this will continue until the end of the world as well in my opinion .but the base and the form of these disagreements changes over time .nowadays , the behaviours of young people among themselves or to their society are a major problem in the society .people come together to help each other .this is why a community is formed .an individual can be considered week without its community .i hereby admit that nowadays young people do not give enough time to build good relationships with their communities .the also do not help other individuals in their community .this condition widens the gap between them and their society .youngsters may have distinct hobbies other than older people or other young people have .but they should respect to the other ideas and hobbies first of all .i consider this issue in order to emphasize the importance of being respectful while communicating in a community .this will help community to reach qualified standards .because the communication is very important in a society .however , young people do not behave in that manner .for example , yestarday , i saw a young man that is listening music with his walkman phone in the bus .that s ok , he can listen whatever he wish .but not that loudly .the volume of the music was loud enogh to make us listen to .another youngster near him said : ` hey , can you adjust the volume .pull the volume down man !` after this , they started arguing in the bus and the people in the bus were unhappy .there are two wrong behaviors in this example .the first one is the loudness of the music that the youngster listening to : the second one is the attitude of the other youngster while talking rudely .as a result , other people ( community ) became unhappy .if the youngsters would hae wanted to help them , they behave differently and respectfuly .youngsters nowadays do not read any books .` i do nt like reading .i prefer playing with my game cube.  they say .the young people of this generation are the managers of the next generation , next age .how can a lazy and untalented person manage a group of people .a question here may arise : ` is taking responsibility directly proportional to having enough knowledge - so reading ?the answer is always ` yes !  for me .the more you know , the more you help your community .not during your young ages , but during your older ages while working for your country .being a very important virtue , reading should not be underestimated .for an instance , how an untalented and less-reader teacher can help his/her society ?he/she can not .in conclusion , youngsters should be more carrefully while communicating with their community and helping them .
