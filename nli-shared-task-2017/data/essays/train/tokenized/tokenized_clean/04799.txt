before giving my opinion , i would like to clarify that each thesis can be right beacuse nobody knows the future .however , i believe that in twenty years there will exist more cars than they exist today .i think this for three reasons .fist of all , people and the word is getting richer .we are increasing our power of acquistion , and by consequent , we will be able to buy more items .for example , a family who has only a car , but they need one for the father , one for the mother and another for the children , is not going to hesitate to buy another car if they can financially .moreover , driving cars and the world of the motor belongs definitively to our culture and we can demonstrate this idea when we observe young people .for instance , i am a young person and since i was eight years old , i have been dreaming to have my own car .furthermore , my friends who are nineteen years old , drive their own car , and they would like to buy always another one .besides this idea , prices of cars are going down and we can notice that nowadays even poor peole have their own car .the reason that prices are cheaper , is because there are lot of sellers and that is why these people need to increase the market , and by consequent , there will be more people with car .nevertheless , i recognize that the price of petroleum will reach a considerable amount of money .thus , buyers will be afraid to buy more cars and so , to spend more money in gas .fortunately , scientits will discover another way to provide energy to cars .another important point is that people are getting more ecologists , and the idea of using car will be seen in a bad way .ecologists will have an important word to say in a soon future .in conclusion , i think that there will be more cars in the future and that it will not be avoided by some reasons like energy or he ecologists .personnally , i would prefer to live in a healthier world .
