having knowledge is always good .knowledge gives us culture and also shows us different points of view about things .i think it is better to know about many subjects than just know about one in particular .people live in a society and interact with other people .in my opinion , the only way to understand people is to know about them .when you have the knowledge about a variety of subjects , you have a wider mind and it is easier to understand people s behavior in almost any situation .if you are a doctor , for example , you need to know about your patients  behavior .you need to talk to them when they are in pain .it is easier for you if you have studied psichology , for instance .so , it is better if you have knowledge not just in medicine .knowledge about different subjects gives us culture and can be helpul in some cases .it allows us to know about art , literature , and many other subjects that are important for our character .if we study art and literature , we can be more creatives .if we study technology , we can repair some appliances at home .it is practical to know about different subjects .in my opinion , the more we know , the more complete person we are .if we have time , it is better to study different subjects than just one .in this way we can easily interact with the people , we can be more creative and , at the same time it can be usefuf for our daily activities .as a conclusion , we are learning everyday about different subjects .it is good to do it for our own good .
