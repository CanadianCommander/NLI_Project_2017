i study communications and i have learned that one of the objectives of advertising is to rescue the positive things of a product or service .so i disagree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  because i think that advertisements do nt make products seen better , they just show the positive things of a product .for example , if i buy watches , maybe my watches are nt cheap , but they have a guarantee for 10 years .so i have to communicate - in the advertisement - `` my watches are nt cheap but you are going to save a lot of money because of the 10 years guarantee  .what is not permitted is to be dishonest .in a class named `` legislation of the communication medias  i learned that are advertising codes and rules that shoud nt be broken .in that code is stated that companies ca nt lie about their products .once i heard a profesional in advertising saying that `` if you have to use dirty kinds of advertisements is because you arent a good advertiser  .i completely agree with that .if you are professional in what you do , you will sure find a good quality of the product to advertise instead of breaking rules and being dishonest .its true that advertisements have to persuade , but there are a lot honest and legally ways to make an effective persuation .of course there are advertisements that make the products seem much better than they really are , but i do nt think there are the most .there will always be people that brake rules , but you will surprise to see how many people make his best effort with the rules they have .
