i disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for several reasons .in my opinion and personal experiences , there are many disadvantages of traveling in a gruop such as time limitation , bad service atitudes and worng shopping locations .the first important reason why i disagree this idea because time limitaion .there are many locations in one day and never have enough time to spend .therefore , we do nt enjoy any location and also wast our time at some locations are not necessary to stop by .furthermore , since the group trip has so many locations need to go , most time of the trip spend on the bus in stead of walking around and talking with local reisdents .also , a tour guide s service atitudes affects the whole trip .i used to travel with a tour guide who is not thinking careful and rude sometimes .if any vistor in a group with a bad tour guide , this trip wo nt be fun .it s sad that most trips we ca nt choose tour guide .furthermore , everytime we travel in a group led by a tour guide who always led us to a unreasonable department store or others shops where shop owners and tour guides can share the grants .this is the most reason i will not travel in a group .it happends a lot in south asia and china .whenever i want to travel somwhere , i will ask for people s opinions and research any good location .it is the best way to travel .i will not recomand to anyone who want to trave in a group in south asia and china .
