i believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .obviously some young people do , but not enough of them .first , i believe it is very important for young people to learn compassion .and what better way to understand what compassion is than by practising it by helping your community .adolescence is a shaping time for a person .it is probably the best moment to learn to help others .by doing so , young people learn to become mature and good adults .many wars have probably been declared because adults leading a country had not been sufficiently exposed to helping others when they were younger .therefore , training great adults is only possible by training young people to help their community .second , if young people were spending more time helping their communities , they would be better integrated in it and they would show greater respect for their elders and neighbours .we can observe many examples of what happens when young people lack respects for their community in most developped countries nowadays .in france , early 2006 , sworms of young people from the ghettos around paris and other large cities burnt cars and broke into shops .this young people do not spend time helping their community .instead , they commit petty crimes and spend their days doing in their ghettos .it is difficult to imagine that nobody needs help in those areas .another example are the gangs in many cities in the us .there , young people spend their time killing other gangs rather than helping their community .third , in my experience , very few young people actually help their communities nowadays .if i count how many people have been helping their community among the young people i met so far , they are very few .i guess that the lack of incentives and the continuous pressure of our society tends to push young people toward enjoying themselves , avoiding work and taking an easy time .to conclude , i would say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .however , it would be beneficial for them and their community as young people but as future adults as well .
