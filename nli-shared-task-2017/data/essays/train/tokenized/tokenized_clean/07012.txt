i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communites in korea .first , young korean people ( middle and high school students ) have to study hard to enter the good university .because they and their parents want to be successful in life .we , korean , think that the good university is the first step to be successful in life .when i also was a student , i just focused on the study .so i did nt think about our communities .second , when we enter good university , we have to also study our subjects .for example , i study dentistry at my university .i always take a test 7 to 10 times per month .so i just concentrate on study .sometimes we have free time , but we always sleep .and other students ( law , economy , .. )tried to get good scoresat toefl , toeic , ..etc. they always live in library .so if we tried to help our communities we have to contribute our time .finally , when we were students ( from elementaty to university ) we did nt have much experience to help someone .i think our habit can not be changed easily .we always think much of ourselves .in conclusion , if old generation in korea want to change the mind ofyoung people not to be individualitic , they have to try to change their own mind .we learned that my success was more imprtant than anything else .so we are so very private .we learned this for more than 15 years , so we ca nt change easily our thoughts .of course , all of them is responsible for old generation .we , young people , have to change our thoughts .i m also growing , after few decades i ll be old generation .that time i and my friends have to change our environment .
