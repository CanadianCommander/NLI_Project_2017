i agree with the following statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .the aim of most advertisements is to make more money even if their product is not as good as they may advertise it .in order to sell thier products , most advertisers say good things about their products in order to gain the marketting compare to other advertisers .they may tell you of the low price , the good teast , how it , s good for your health and all the possible good things it can do .when you go to buy the advertised product , you may find that all they said about it is not true but you already bought it .what they are after is money .advertised products at time may have adverse effect on each and every individual .this may cause some allergies in some people and even death depending on the severity of the allergy .en general , most advertisments are not real , they are made to convince people to buy their product and not to satisfy the need of the population they serve even though some exeptions do exist .
