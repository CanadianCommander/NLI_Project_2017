i agree in some part with the statement .people who succed in the things they want , had to pass through different stages in life .for example people who is persistent with the ideas they have to achieve a personal goal , it is more problably to be successful than perople who give up so easily and do not try hard even though they fail on the first intent .of course , if you try new things and take risks you have more possibilities to get what you want or get where you want to .taking risks take a lot of courage is here when people decide if they want to try to get better results or risk and get worse results .on the other hand if you stay in the comfort zone where you know you are doing what you like to do and you are doing it well ; you also have the chance to fail or to succed .because you are doing things the way they have to be done , so this can give you a lot of self confidence neccesary to achive the goals you have in mind .for example , if a good income tax cpa has a successful firm and good reputation , but he decides to study law to improve his knowledge about tax law and rules , to be that way more helpful for his clients .at the end he will get better results even thouhg he thinks that doing this will take a lot of time to be with his family or in the office .he took the risk but it will bring better success to his firm .decisions play important role in our lives .that is how we move through existence .how we sometimes we take risks and how other times we act cautious .we will never know if staying where we are or taking a risk will be the best thing to do .so we just have to decide .
