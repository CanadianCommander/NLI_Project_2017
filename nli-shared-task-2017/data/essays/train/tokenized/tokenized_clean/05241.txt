well , i kinda disagree with the statement given because in my opinion you ca nt really understand ideas and concepts if you do nt have a good knowledge about facts , and viceversa .so , i think they both are important for students .for example , if a teacher would clear concepts such as socialism or comunism in an history class , he will of course need to explain and let students understand ideas and concepts of these two important subjects , but he would nt give his students a complete preparation on that without taking consideration of the facts , like the fact that following this ideas and concepts the russian post warsaw-pact ( and all its satellite s countries  ) economy have fallen because it was nt possible to rule a country with that kind of principles .i am sure that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , so that they can take their decisions and follow or ignore some of them to finally have their own ideas and concepts to grow their capability to interact and agree or disagree with other people in a wide range of fields .but i would nt say that this is more important than learning facts , because if you have your ideas and concepts but ca nt use them for they do nt fit with reality nor with what history tells us , you will never be able to bring an interesting point of view about any topic given .so a good balanced preparation both in the `` ideas and concepts-area  and in the `` facts learning-area  will give the students the best way to take decisions , have their own ideas to fight for , make up their minds ( why not ? ! )and finally feel free to talk about any subject without feeling ignorant or frustrated because of their lack of knowledge about ideas and concepts or because of a fact itself .
