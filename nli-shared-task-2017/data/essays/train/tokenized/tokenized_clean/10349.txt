i agree with this statement that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities based on my experience .first of all , for a period of time , educaters or parents do not give enough ecouragement to young people of the importance of contributing to communites .for example , high school or junior high school students are only pressured by school work such as homework .therefore , they do not have an opportunities to learn the importance of giving others like doing a volunteer work for the poor or old citizen in our society .this phenomenon continues when they grow up and become a university student .during this period , they are apt to feel much pressure caused by their future career .this concern results in that students become selfish and only pursue their own interests for their sake .they learn only how to compete each other and seek for the methods how they can be successful as soon as possible .they do not have chances to think about what they gain from community they are living .furthermore , there is another serious problem that causes this phenomenon .for a decade , there are increasing numbers of people who go abroad to study or immigrate to a foreingn country .it means that the community is threatend by decreasing numbers of people who would forget to contribute to their society .lastly , there are a diversity of entertaining activities that would attract young people .there exist a tons of movie theaters , shopping malls , restaurants and bars for young people to enjoy and spend their time .they are just hectic to spend their free time in enjoying their hobbies with friends with various fun activities .who would want to do a volunteer work for other people or be concous of how their community is going in their busy lives ?these three reasons make me think that young people are not contributing to their society enough and appreciating their community .
