in my view young people are enjoying life more than the old people .a perfect example to support my view would be me [ young ] when compared to my father [ old ] .i have no responsibilities to take care of .so i have more time to fish out , hang out with friends and participate in social activities .on the other hand , my father has lot of responsibilities .he has his time devoted to certain activities .he is so occupied with this that he does not get any time to enjoy his life .i also believe that attitude is another factor which can support my view .young people have possitive or open kind of attitude .while the old people have reserved kind of attitude .yound people think that here is lot to enjoy in life .old people just think opposite to this .another reason to support my view would be spending factor .i normally spend more than my father .my father prefers to save instead .by spending i am able to try our new things , party , going places etc and enjoy life .technology advancement is also one of the reason .today technology has lot to offer .it makes life interesting .i watch movies , take joy rides , play computer games .this facilities were not available in the earlier days .the very meaning of life has changed with the generation .
