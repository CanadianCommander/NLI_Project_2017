as a matter of fact , it is impossible to know everything on every subjects .everyone has to make choices .we can choose to know a little about many subjects , to have an overview of each academic subject .or we can decide to become an expert in one specific area .in my opinion , becoming a specialist in one subject is a better issue because we will really understand the purpose of the subject and we will not obtain only a superficial knowledge .it is trust to say that when somebody does nt know everything on a subject , he can arrive to the bad conclusions concerning a probleme .then , his knowledge is useless .what is the aim of knowing a little a everything ?this is nt usefull .for example , if we study a part of the french law , we ca nt solve any situation because a lot of elements will miss us .we must know all the articles refering to the problem , all the previous situations which look like the one we are studying .otherwise we are certain to make an error .by knowing major issue of many purpose , we can seem very bright for a while .but it is a superficial knowledge .somebody like that seems very interesting but in fact he ca nt assure a real conversation on any of the subject he pretends to know .all his knowledge is a superficial one .deciding to specialize in one specific subject is the best way to be really usefull and to obtain an advantage from our knowledge .learning little parts of everything is a waste of energy .being a specialist is being professional , efficient and usefull .
