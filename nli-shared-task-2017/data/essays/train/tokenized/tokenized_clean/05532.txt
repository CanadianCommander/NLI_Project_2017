i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .i personally like new products and often buy those new advertised products by tv .however , i usually get disappointed and regret spending extra money .i will explain why i think the advertisements make products seem better than they really are .for instance , i often believe that the advertisements of cosmetic products are way too much exagerated .we often see the beautiful models wearing new products and telling us the difference from other products in advertisements .after we watch the advertisement , we feel that we might be able to change ourselves and become like the model who advertised it .this is wrong .we forget that the model is already beautiful without wearng this new product .she might look different with new product , however , it does not mean that we , who all buy new product , can have face or be like her .for so many times , i was disappointed to try new cosmetics noticing that i look nothing different from using other products .i think the cosmetic advertisements make products seem much better than they really are through advertising with beautiful models and professional make-up artists .another example is the advertisement of frozen food .since i do not cook often , i always buy frozen foods for my dinner .in the tv advertisements , those foods look so good and delicious , but in reality , they are not as good as they look like in tv advertisements .that is because in advertisements , the company use recent cooked food and film or take pictures wth the perfect angle decided by professional person .the disappointment after cooking several minuites in microwave oven is huge for me and sometimes i feel anger buying those products .some products look completely different from the ones advertised in tv .i think that the most advertisements have tried to show products much worth than they really are .i know that is the role and nature of advertisements in this consumer society .we all should keep that in mind .
