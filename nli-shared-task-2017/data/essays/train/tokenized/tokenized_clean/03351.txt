there is no best way to travel .both in group and individually travelling enlightens .nonetheless , i personally prefer by far the individual travel experience .my prime argument for this conviction comes from personal experience .as a frequent traveller , i love to discover .the challenge of exploring pathes no traveller has walked , inspires my discoveries .contrary to travelling in group no tour guide will be able to decide where to go or when to leave .this exalting freedom is essential to enrich the travel experience .secondly , though the security of a group travelling through well-known ground is appealing , the level of discovery is enhanced by reaching remote areas .once out in more distant regions , security becomes less a concern .while few foreigners travel to these regions , curiosity from the local population is more widespread than criminal behavior .i would even believe that a travelling group would attract more attention of a criminal than an individual wanderer .of course , many will state that without a good tour guide you might miss out some essential sightseeing locations of a visited area .this lack of knowledge of the region , however , can easily be compensated by hiring an individual guide for short trips or by relying on the excellent insights of guide books such as ` the lonely planet  .last but not least , i strongly recommend to travel indivudually because it enables true contact with local populations .as a group under the leadership of a tour guide , you will probably meet with the population used to communicate with tourists .shopowners , the family of the tour guide , ...will not give you the genuine impression of the country you visit .a narrow perspective from a tourist-minded population will be the result .as an individual traveller the chances exist that a true relationship between indivuduals can emerge .as an example i recall the conversation with the farmer with whom i shared lunch during his break in the ricefields of indonesia .he elaboratly explained me his life and his misery .this is an unique experience impossible to accomplish in a tour guide travel experience .in conclusion , although tour guides do an excellent job securing and informing their guests , individual travelling has my predelection .the discovery of remote areas and the enlightment of personal encounters have inspired my frequent travels .
