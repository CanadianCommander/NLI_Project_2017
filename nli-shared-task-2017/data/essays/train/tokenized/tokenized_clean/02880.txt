nowadays since people are children there is a sort of competition for everything , for a footballmatch for example or for a running competition or for having a better marks at school .in this way a person always try to do the better of her so i think that people who can try always to win this competition in life can have the power to became a successful person because they love to risks and they re proud when they try to pass their limit .i think also that pass ownselfs limits means to make something that its bigger and more important than do a thing well known .it s easier to do well something that we known than create something new .for example a normal artists can produce an accademical paint well made , that it s also armonic and pleasant to see but it remains an exercise of the hand .instead a successfull people want to experiment new thecnics , new points of views ; new colors in order to really create something new that noone had ever seen and in order to obtain this , the successful people have to risks , have to abbbandon all his own knownoledge to adventure himself in another unknown world of the creation .at the end i agree with the statement also if often peolple who risks , ca nt reach success because of differentes causes and on the other hand someone who had never tried to risks became a successful person because the raccomandation of some importants people .
