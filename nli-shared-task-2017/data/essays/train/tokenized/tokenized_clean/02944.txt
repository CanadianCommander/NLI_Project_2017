i will be honest , i never thought about such a topic if there will be fewer cars in use in some years .i can not totally agree with this statement because therefore the other possibilities are too bad that so many people will not use their car anymore .more or less , the only thing here in germany is the `` deutsche bahn  and a lot of people are not so happy with this company because you never can be sure if your train arrives or not .in comparison to this , there are a few companies where you can come to work when you like to come and not everyone is able to change the house for the job .as well , i can not totally disagree with this statement because there are steps which will offer you better possibilities to get from point a to point b but this have to be cheap in addition , the new trend from people is to live for the nature and future .furthermore , it stops the pollution if there are less cars in use and you do not have to spent so much money in oil , gas and security .not everybody will be able to pay for a car in a few years .because of never thinking about this topic , i was a little bit confused but i think there will be less cars in a few years .if f.i. the deutsche bahn get it und will be more punctual and have special offers that means that it is cheaper than having a car , then it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .in germany there are more and more offers to get to another place f.i. there is a page in the internet where you put in the date , time and place when you want to go anywhere and there are people who catch you and take you with them to your place for not paying a lot of money .
