what advertisements want to tell us ?we can see a lot of advertisements everywhere nowadays .some is very serious , other is very interesting .however , in my opinion , i agree this opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following reasons : it gives positive images , they are emphasized and they are not clear sometimes .first of all , advertisements are usually gives us positive images storongly .for example , cosmetics companies always use beautifle actoress or models for their products  advertisements .thus , if people had positive image for her , they would also thed to have great image for the product even if they do not know quarities of the products .secondly , advertisements are usually greatly emphasized .for instanse , food companies shows how excellent their products are , using blilliant color or showing atractive pictures .i bought a chocolete cake because a advertisement was so atractive and it looked great , however it was not as delicious as i expected from its advertisements .finally , advertisements are not clear at times , because the most important information is not stated in advertisements or even stated , it is hard to notice .for example , clothing companies  advertisements highlights prices of their products .however , it usually do not show materials of its products .in conclusion , it is true that advertisements are important for both companies and customers .however .i strongly think there are many advertisements which shows much better than actual products .the proper judgement for advertisements is essential for us .
