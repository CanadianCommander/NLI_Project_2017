i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .there are several reasons why i think this way .in this essay , i am going to talk about them .first , we can apply those broad knowledge base of many academic subjects to further learnings .without basic broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it can be hard to learn new things because what we only know well is only one specific subject .in this sense , we can only adopt new things relating to the one specific subject we know well about .for example , say that i did nt focus on any other subject but only on chemistry .and i faced new graphs like velocity vs. time .even though i can just memorize the characterstics , it will be very confusing to understand why the graphs look like that without knowledges in mathmetics .therefore , some knowledge in mathematics would help me in learning chemistry as well .thus , broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important .second , it will develop us in thinking critically , beyond and above .if our knowledge is limited in one specific subject , then our brain will work relating only to that specific subject .for example , say that i learned about european history in the history class .we are to memorize the facts that happened in each country time by time for internal assessments and tests .at this point , imagine you also learned a lot about economics in the class .now then the events took in each country time by time will appear a lot easier than they were when you did nt know anything about economics .this is because the historical events are somewhat related to its economic conditions at that time as well .like this , broad knowledge of many academic subjects help us think critically , beyond and above .lastly , we can have a good conversation with any kind of people in variety of jobs or professions in society .if i lack of broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it will be hard to understand people of different professions than ours .therefore , it can result my bad relationship with other people later on .for example , say that i m professional in economics and i m meeting a philosopher for first at a cafe .personally , i want to make a good relationship with him .however , during the talk , whatever he thinks is way too much different than i think that is .also , it s hard to understand him because i do nt know anything about other subjects from economics ; as well as philosophy .therefore , i will definitely have a hard time talking to him .but imagine if any one of us had broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; say the philosopher did , then he would understand me even his thoughts are different from what i think .then , we will somehow keep good relationship between each other .like this , broad knolwedge of many academic subjects help us in communicating with other people and make social relationships better in the future .in conclusion , with the facts above , i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .it helps us apply them to further learnings , develops our critical thinking skills and gives a chance to make a good social relationship with other people .
