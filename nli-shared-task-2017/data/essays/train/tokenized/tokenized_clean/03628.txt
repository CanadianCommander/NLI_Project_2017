it is often said that young people do not give enough of their time to help the communities .in my opinion this is not true because of serveral reasons .firstly the workload is steadily increasing and thus the time available is becoming less and less .it is also clear that young poeple do help their communities but it is just less recognized by everyone esle in society .young people often have to make important decisions and steps in their lives .this needs a lot of time to be put in and it requires the a lot of engagement of the student .an example would be the university application process .the selection of university and the time consuming creation of a personal statement .this is further promoted by the pressure which is put on youngsters by all kinds of different institutions for example sport teams , school , colleges and parents .even thouh every individual person is more and more self centred it would be a wrong generalization to disregard any community work which is done by young adults .such community work ranges from charity events for local disabled person centres to the actual help done by many people to be a superviser in such a centre .often this is done voluntarily and no financial wage is received by the helping people .another reason is that such work is often not recognized by the general public because it is incorporated into school activity .such an example would be the cas whcih all students in my school have to complete .this involves 60 hours of sports , action and service .especially the service is often achieved by helping out in charity events or fundraising for local communities but also for bigger organisations for example unicef .unicef is collecting money and with this money they are helping people in a different part of the world .this may as well lead to the conclusion by others that no community work is being done because they ca nt see the results of such an involvement .in conlcusion it has to be noticed that the work young poeple do today has indeed changed an may even be less than it used to be .but in general there is still the same effort put into this work and the results can be seen in many examples .this statement reflects the desintrest of many adults in the work done by young people and wants to compare two different periods of time which is obviously not possible .
