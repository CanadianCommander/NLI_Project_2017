the issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic fields or to specialize in one subject .this question is not easy to answer , because i am convinced that this question is not able to be answered generally .i believe that there are several points which do not support that knowledge of many subjects is the better option and there are several ones which do .a disadvantage of having broad knowledge is that this sometimes means , that you are less familiar with each subject .sometimes in working life it is really important to have a subject you are really good at and not several ones you are less good at .if a company is searching for a new translater for english , it does not help that an applicant is also able to speak french and italian , if the result is that the english skills are only good instead of very good .but i am also quite sure that specializing on only one subject could be disadvantagable , because it is always important to be interested in and to have skills except your specific subject .some jobs require skills in many different fields .teachers are a good example .for being a good english teacher it is not enough to speak english very well .a teacher should also have knowledge about didactics , psychology and pedagogics , because he must be able to teach , to communicate and to handle students in a appropriate way .additionally , there are some skills , called soft skills , everbodz should have and which is more important that acedamic knowledge .being able to work in a team is a good example .it does not help you to know everything about a knowledge , if you are not able to work in a project group .in conclusion , i am quite certain that a mix of both , specializing in a subject and also having a broad knowledge is the best option .
