in the current society , the combined ability is always be required .especially the basic capacity of english and computer .in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .as i mentioned above , more and more jobs need people to have more than one abilities .such as my major is finance and banking , but if i just be familiar with how the banks operations , it is firely not enough .because with the developing of the banking system , a lot of new and comprehensive things occered to banks and they have to accept them because of the harsh competition .for example , the bonds relatived to the performance of many companys .we have to have the good knowledge of accouting and mathmatics to do it .it showes that have broad knowledge could meet the requirement .have many skills also help us have a broader carrer range .if one only specialize in one specific subject , he or she could only doing one job for his/her whole life .if he/she find the job is boring or not the real things they like to do , there is no chance to change for him/her , which is really regretful .we can easy to turn to other jobs with a broad knowledge and we can solve the problems we meet by more than one method .i can not imagine that doing one thing all my life .i love to change .i love the excitement that changes give me .the changes can make my life colourful and happy .so i choose to have a broad abilities .the broad knowledge make us do our jobs better as well .such as with the wonderful logical thinking of maths and good foundation of chinese , i can make the banking essays more perfect !
