i totally agree with the statement that the young people today really do nt spend enough time helping their communities .and that is also what i do nt want to see and expect .in the following disscusion , i will present the reasons which cause the result and how to solve the problem .the first reason why the young people today do nt give time to help their communities is that there are more and more things attract them .when the young students are after class , they may do some activities with their friends such as shoping or something like that .the beautiful clothes in the department stores or the popular video games in the club may attract them .that means that they will pay more attention on what they like and spend more time on what they are intereted in .so that is why the young people do not give enough time to help their communities .there are lots of things they want .it makes sence that they may forget some other important things such as the communities stuff .the second reason is that the most young people tend to take the material they have for granted .they do not appreciate it because they think that they deserve it .so maybe they will think that the communities stuff is not their business and they do nt have to take the responsibility for it .toward this problem , i think the best solution is education .we have to teach the young people about their duty of helping their communities .a good community is based on many people s effort .we have to let them know that they are also the part of the communities .so they should spend enough time toward it no matter what reasons they have .to be more specific , let me give an example to explain more clearly .each of us all belongs to a family .so who should spend time on the household things .i think that you will say each member in the family should spend time on them .and that is what i want to say .just like this example , each member in the community should give enough time to help their communities because they are the members in the communities .t sum up , i agree that in today s society , young people really spend less time to help the communities .and the reasons why is just like what i mention above .what we can do is try our best to teach them about the importance of the participation in the communities .
