i feel certain that it s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .first of all , i consider having knowledges of various subjects could be a valuable advantage for general culture .i really think that is important to be polyvalent and to be interested in different subjects .however , you should be aware that all informations are not right .consequently you should nt be lost in a  `` vast ocean of information  .furthermore , you are not limited , that means you are able to talk with different persons about various subjects whereas a person who is specialized in one specific subject are not .when you are speaking with friends for insance , you can take part at the conversation and express your opinion about the topic since you have studied several points about it .in a nutshell , although being specialized in one particular subject do seem to offer certain advantages like depthy knowleges , they are outweighed by the advantages of acquiring knowlege of several topics .
