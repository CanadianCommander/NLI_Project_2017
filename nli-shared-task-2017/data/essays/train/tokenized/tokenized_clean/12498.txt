nowadays , scolarship has developped a lot and people have an ever increasing pannel of choices to study .thus we feel entitled to wonder if it is better to study many academic subjects or to study a specialized subject .we will see first that in some cases it is better to be specilalized but then , we will demonstrate that it is often beneficial to study a large pannel of subjects .first of all , the specialization in a subject is useful and preferable for some people .indeed , when you have studied only few subjects , you are better in the field concerned .thus , some jobs need to be specialized .to be a doctor is a case in point .someone who wants to be a doctor had better to learn only biology and medecines to be better and to succeed .moreover , it is preferable to learn only one subject when you are very intersting in it .indeed , if you love what you do , you will have better results and you will be less disturbed .you will be more concentrated in what you are studying .however , specialization is not everytime the best thing to do .studying a large range of subjects at school make people more open minded and more cultivated .in a matter of fact , when you are not specialized , you will discover in some subjects very interesting things that you would have not discovered by yourself .in addition , learning many subjects enable people to be more adaptable and to practice a large scale of works .for instance , in a buisness school , student can reach many different jobs because they have studied a lot of different subjects such as finance , marketing , human resources . ..this kind of person is able to replace itself in the case of non success or non interest .all in all , we can say that specialising in a subject can be useful for people who know what to do in order to be the best in their field .yet , to broad own s knowledge enable to adapt to everyone and to reconvert ownself .
