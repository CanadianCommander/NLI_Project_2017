i agree with this statement even though i personally preffer traveling by myself to joing the package tour .i agree with this statement with some reasons in the terms of price , security and the time .as the first reason to agree with this statement , it can be said that if you join the package tour , it sometimes is much cheapter than organising and planing by yourself because you can get `` group/party discount  .moreover , the travel companies know which place to go or to eat so that the tour price will not to be too expensive .some people believes that it will be cheapter if you organise by yourself but it is not the 100 percent case .second point is about the security .even if you get the insurance when traveling by yourself , you still might face the danger especially when you travel the places you are not familier to .in the case of group tour , however , the tour guide knows much about the place and it is the tour guide s responsibility to take the customers safe to the trip .many elderly people seem to join package tour due to this security matter .thirdly , if you join the package tour , you do not have to spend any time to organise the tour and to book for accomodation and so on .and most of the case , the package tour includes famous and popular tourist place to go and moreover , the tour guide will explain things such as historical background od the place they visit and so on .as i stated above , there are many advantages when you join the package tour led by a tour guide but there are also some disadvantages .first , if you joing the package tour , you can not and you do not have to communicate with local people .by communicating with local people , you can experience many things such as local life and you can get much information .and in the best case , you can be a friend of them .second , you can not see the place other than the places which are not included to the schedule .i still agree with this statement but i also think it depends on people .
