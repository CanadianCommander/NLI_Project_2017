education is a perfect amalgation of understanding of learned facts and their application .this is the essence of education .no theory states education is learning facts blindly .if learning facts matter a parrot can speak learnt rubbish. a lot better than a man can .it is understanding of the ideas and their application which make a good student and distinguish him from an ordinary graduate .education does not mean learning facts by heart or reading lit of text books .i was taken by surprise when i accidentally noticed paintings by small kids .one of them was named ` flowers  and the child drew blue colour for rose and black colour for sunflower .later when i was going to my house i noticed a streeboy smaller than that age drawing flowers in the ground using chalk pieces and colouring them perfectly .not all things are taght in the book , some are taught by life .personal experiences value more than reading ` rose is red  .if sir issac newton have had learnt the facts there would be no ` theory of gravity  .innovative thinking adds a lot to the vision of understanding facts .learn trade rather than remember what is trade .if albert instein would have learnt the fact that atom has electrons , the fact goes to the next generation as atom has electrons ; but because he understood what is atom we today enjoy atomic energy through theory of relativity .if mere learning of facts is education , then that education fetches nothing but only useless graduation degrees to our back .if we understand facts then we know how to manipulate the lnowledge we know for a better work .with the modern busy life many dont have time to understannd ideas .what all they have is time to learn facts .if learning facts blindly is education then that education is useless .if a student learns what a machine is and has never seen a machine or never seen a machine at work , he only remembers the formulae of working of the machine and nothing else .in practical life he is not more than a fool or a numbskull .
