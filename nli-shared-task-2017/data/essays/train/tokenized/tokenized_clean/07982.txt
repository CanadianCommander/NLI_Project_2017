the two concepts of success and risk are they related ?are we sure to achieve our goal when we re willing to take some risks ?a statement says that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well  .we could reply to this statement by another saying ` the best is the ennemy of the good  .it means that success is always appealing , but it over all needs to be sustainable .however , i think the fact that we take a risk to try to achieve our aim is exciting .on one hand if we managed , if we indeed suceed , the achievement feels even better .the dimension of risk makes it more unique .you appreciate more something when you have struggled for it .it also makes you move forward , push your limits backwards .on the other hand , if we fail to suceed because we have dared commit in the project as the risks were present , then it makes you revise your vision of the risk .are the risks taken worth the final goal ?to my opinion , i m willing to take risks when i have a minimum of visibility .i mean , i do not take blind risks and i do not count only on my luck .risks must be assessed .and it is important enough to be underlined , when we are taking risks , we shall not commit anyone else s responsability without he or she acknowledges and agrees with it .so , i do agree with the initial statement .indeed , i think successful people are people willing to move forward , who makes prove of tenacity to succeed .if you never try anything new , you do nt broad your scope .
