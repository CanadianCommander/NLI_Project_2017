some people think yonger people enjoy life more than older people do , because they are healthier than older people .i , however , think older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because of my personal experience .i , therefore , disagree with the statement which says yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .older people have more knowledge than yonger people .they have lived longer lives than yonger people and they have had more knowledge than them .therefore , older people will try new things that are good for them .for example , young people spend their time to play or play games with their friends on weekend , however , older people climb the mountain with their business members or travel somewhere to rest .this shows that older people do better activities than yonger people , which what make them to be healthier .therefore , i belive that older people enjoy life more than yonger people .older people have more money than yonger people .this means older people have more alternatives to do .for example , one day my father told a story about ski-diving .at that time i did not know about ski-diving so my father brang me a place where is for ski-diving .many people were enjoying it and i really wanted to try .i , however , did not have money at that time , therefore , i could not do that and i thought older people are lucky because they have money to do ski-diving .older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because they have more knowledge about life and money , which means they have more alternatives .my personal experience taught me that older people can play more sports than yonger people and older people know more about what is good for them , i , therefore , disagree that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
