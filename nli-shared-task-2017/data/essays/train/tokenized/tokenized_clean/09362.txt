i totally agree with this statement .it perfectly reflects our society , which is based on appearance .today advertisement has become an added value .it is something that some years ago we did not even have , but that today plays a central role in the society .i am attending a master in international business and during this master i attended a marketing class .our professor explained us how advertisement is important today .more and more societies spend huge quantities of money in advertisement , as they think it is a good investment .and the results always come .one example that can give us the mirror of the situation is given by the company pippo .this company produces low quality brushes .twenty years ago , it was just a small company and today it has become one of the richest company in italy .what the owner of the company did , was just to invest some money in advertising his product .they used a very good strategy and they finally reached their goal .they pushed housewives to go to the supermarkets and ask for the brush named pippo .they created , through an advertisement , value on a product which nobody had cared about before .the worst thing is that this product has a very low quality and does not reflect the perception we have watching the advertisement .one of the most important skill that people are required is the capability of selling .i have done a few interviews in different companies .in each one of them , people working in the human resources department asked me to try to sell something that did not have any value .they just wanted to see if i was able to do it , because today appearance is more important than the reality .
