it is nt difficult to me to answer this question because i have thought since i was a child the same thing .according to my own experience i m sure that the better way to create and improve my student career and first of all my personality is to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .i refuse the idea that the best way is to specialize in one specific subject .i ve grown up into an academic system that has always gave me all the chance to learn about everything i ve wanted .during these years i spent a lot of time to read about a large amounts of material as scientific papers , historian ones , literarian ones and much more .i think that for a person with a broad knowledge is easier to find job , to create relationship with other peole , to follow the most part of television , paper , and book discussion .moreover if you do nt close any doors on your back you can always come back and start with another subject .by the way i trust that also is important to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays the world of work requires more and more specialistic workers .for example i m attending a course of biomedical engineering and i know that the society wants to hire personal specialized the deepest as possible .and the world of science is not the only one ; also in economic field there is a great specialization .the university are following this way of learning proposing a large number of specialization courses .in conclusion it could be seem a contradiction but for me the two ideas are related : i believe that before is more important for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subbjects , and then , only at a second moment , to specialize into specific one .
