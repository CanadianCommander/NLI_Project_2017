have you ever seen a depressed young person or a merry old man ?many of us would answer positively to this question .i believe that enjoying life is not restricted to young people , though many of the joyful activities would certainly need enthusiasm and energy supposed to be abanduntly found at the younger age .through our life we face many happy incidents , as well as difficult moments that assist in formulating our attitude in life .still i strongly believe that enjoying life is a choice we make on our own .all of us face moments of exhilirating happiness and others where we would be under the impression that we are living in a nightmare .unfortunately , such moments will not come evenly or suqeuentially , so as to get prepared .that is , none of us can be happy or depressed all the time so better make a choice to enjoy life as it is , no matter your age is .to substantiate the above said i will tell you the story of two of my dear relatives that unfortunately passed away last summer .the story is about my dear uncle and aunt who were in their late seventies .my aunt was divorced with very limited material resources to support her children , still she managed to bring up two young gentlemen and a beautiful lady and enjoyed her late days with her two grandsons , though her health was declining fast especially during her last days where she lost her eyesight .still she made a choice to enjoy living every moment of her life , i have never seen my aunt complain or grumble of her circumstances and in the end she died with dignity .on the contrary , my uncle who was with ample financial resources , four sons and daughters and seven grandsons / grand aughters was complaining all the time .unlike my aunt he never remembered any of his achievements in life , he would always see what was missing and start blaming circumstances or his sons and daughters .in the end he died so upset after having a big quarrel with one of his sons .what a waste !but it was his choice .in brief , enjoying life has nothing to do with age , it is a choice we make .a choice to make to get to know how to get the utmost happiness of the blessings god bestow on us and live peacefully with life s inevitable hardships .
