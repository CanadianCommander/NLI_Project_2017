to have broad knowlege is important , but to specialize in one specific subject is more important for researchers and engineers to research and develop new things .therefore i disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .one of the most obvious example is in research laboratory .it is impossible for one person to have broad and deep knowledge , so we must cooprate each other .to research a big project , for example to make space ciatol to make nuclear fusion power plant and so on , it is necessary to gather the professional researchers and engineers which have deep knowledge and experience about it .combining them , new things are developed and researched .when researchers discuss about some new penomenon , if they did not have knowledge and experience which specialized in one specific subject each other , they could getin conclusion , deep knowledge and experience are more important for us .they are useful for us to become specialists .
