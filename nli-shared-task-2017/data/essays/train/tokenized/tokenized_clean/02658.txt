through the television , nespaper , or on the streets we can see any advertisements .and we sometimes feel that advertisements are seem too much better thatn they really are .and that is true .i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are .but there is reason for that they need to make advertisements seem much better that real products .for make looks better , cheaper , bigger , or useful .i will give you some situations for prove my opinion .for the first situation , when you see advertisements , you could see that they are saying that you will never get this products in this price .but when you are going to the mart , you will feel that their products are not that cheaper than other companies products , or sometimes you will see more chaep one .for another situation , when you are driving , you can see the advertisements on the street sometimes .for the example , their is advertisement that advertising a restaurant on the street .usually lots restaurant advertising with their foods pictures .so they are make you to go their restaurant , and get their foods .however , when you go that restaurant , sometimes you feel that their foods are much smaller than advertisement .for the last situation , on tv , we can see lots advertisements .we can see same advertisements in same time , same channel everyday .and whenever the companies built a new product , they are make new advertisements for their new product , so people are going to buy thier new product .for the example , the cell phone .we can see the verizon , or cingular s new cell phone every month or two months .and they advertising that their new cell phone is best cell phone in this world .so they made you buy their new cell phone .but two monts later , they made new cell phone which is much better than your cellphone .now , your cell phone is not the best cell phone in this world at all .when you see my statement with these reasons , you will feel that most advertisements are seem much better than their real products .but for make people buy their products , they will keep make advertisements that seem much better than they really are .
