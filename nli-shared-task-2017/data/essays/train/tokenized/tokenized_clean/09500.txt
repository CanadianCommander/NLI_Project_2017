i strongly agree opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .some people say this society have lots of young people who help our communities and show some example of article of newspaper written about young people who help community , but i think they are particular young people .most young people does not pay their time to help their communities .it is real of nowadays .lots of young people is personalized people nowdays .they do not think ablout others situation .the only thing they focused is their own problem .moreover , young people nowadays does not like activity or performance , rather like staying in home .in home , they play computer game or video game .even they communicate their friend on line not off-line .for example , they chatting and doing group homework by messenger program in computer .it is natural that these toung boy does not like helping their communites .helping communities need lots of activity .studing harder than past is one reason , too .young people in past are not depressed by study .but nowadays , study is prior things to young people .oil price is raise and long-term depression in economy is exist so young people concern about their future naturally .so , they can not afford to give enough time to helping their communities .it is another reason that old people do not struggle to make yong people to help their communities .in past , old people is good role model to young people .but sociey are more developing and lots of people live in city , old people also no more give enough time to helping their communities .roughly speaking , the problem that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is making old people who has not helping their communities .in these reason , i purport that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .young people acknowlege that development of community is develvopment of own quality of life .we need young people who help our community .
