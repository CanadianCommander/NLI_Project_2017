will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there is today ?this is an important question to which many people would like to answer .we will see that some arguments supports this idea and other does not .the price of gas has increadibly raised during the last few years .this made the fact of having a car not affordable to many people .if the price continues to increase gas will become a very luxuous product and it is not the car that will be expensive , but the gas you use to make it work !then there will be fewer cars in use .this tendancy is already there , because some people have a car but do not use them as often as they did because they can not buy the gas .a big problem that we have nowadays is pollution .because of that many decisions have to be taken in order to prevent the planet from dying .one source of pollution is the gas that get out of the cars .some cities already took mesures in order to protect their areas and their environment , such as london .now you have to pay to get into the city .then many people let their car outside of the city and take the bus , which pollutes less because more people use it at once .another example is what you can find in the united states .on the motorways some lines are only for cars with at least two people inside .and most of the time these lines are the fastest !it then encourage people to share their cars .then we can see that having less cars in use will probably become necessary if we want our planet to survive .on the other hand people need to use their car more and more .the main explanation is that nowadays you change job very often and people travel more .if someone has a job , buy a house and a car , what should he do if he changes job ?should he buy a new house each time ?it is not a realistic solution .he will have to use his car to go to work .there is not only for the job that you need your car .people like to do many cultural activities or they like to travel .for all of that most of the time you need a car .for all this reasons of freedom and independance , it is not sure that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .i think that it is possible that there will be fewer cars in twenty years because of the price of the gas and the pollution problems .it will become a necessity for the planet .on the other hand as people really need their car , nothing will change unless some measures are taken such as better public transportation , but not only in one city but within them , without forgetting lands and very small towns .
