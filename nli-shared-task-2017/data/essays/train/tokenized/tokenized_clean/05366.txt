the point of contention is wether young people enjoy life more than older people do .i do not agree with this statement and believe the contrary .the general perception might be that young people enjoy and live life to the fullest as compared to older people because they seem the more active of the lot .i agree that the activities which younger people can indulge in are much more than the activities that older people can indulge in .however the time required to enjoy these activities would be a factor tilted towards the older generation .young people generally lead a very hectic life and may have a very hectic study schedule as the early years of their life are more formative and demand more time towards their academics .older people on the other hand have more of leisure time once they retire .even people who are working at an older age have much more financial independence as compared to the younger generation .as a result older people have a higher degree of freedom to indulge in activities they enjoy .a person matures over the years and an older person can make better choices about activities that excite him .an older person is thus more likely to derive a higher sense of contentment from the activities he or she indulges in .a person who is old and , maybe retired is likely to have lots of free time and can learn more about the things he or she enjoys doing .if for example a person likes to play golf then he has more time on his hands to learn the intricacies of the game .a young person who enjoys playing golf on the other hand may be hard pressed for time .because of this the older person will enjoy the game more for the reason that he has more time to get involved .as a result it might be the case that young people indulge in more number of activities but do not do justice to each one of them .thus in my opinion a person who is older would be leading a more content life and would enjoy his life much more for the reason that he has time to pursue his passions and also the financial independence to do so , both of which might be a hindrance in the case of young people .
