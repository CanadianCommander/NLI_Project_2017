i am certainly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .there are many reasons to hold this opinion .here , i would like to explore some of them .first , successful people believe that opportunity lies in between the difficulties so even if they have to face lots of problems they will fight with them to get success .somebody have told that no pain no gain .if you want success you have to work hard .they know that there is no alternative for the hard work so they keep on working .they know that if i keep on trying i will get success and the moto of their life is try and try but never cry .they always remember the example of the spider which try several time to climb again .trying new thing give them confidence that will motivate them to do something different each time .second , the success that they acheive previously always motivate them to take a chance to do something new .they donot like to do the samething for their entire life .there is always fun in trying new things and getting success .money is also one of motivating force for successful people .i heard about many businessmen who are working in different feilds .for example , relience group of industry is in many feild like petrolium , telecommunication , grocery stores , steel industry and many more .not only the businessmen , actors always try new character they not always do same role .third , successful people never stop dreaming .the always want to take a chance without being worried about the results .like an old saying in my country `` if you want to be successful see dreams at night and wake up in the morning and work hard to make the dreams true  .in summary , i can say that confidence , dreams and hard work rewards person with success and that why successful person keep on trying new things without being worried about risk .
