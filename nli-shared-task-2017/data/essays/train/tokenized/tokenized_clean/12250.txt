as far as i am concerned , advertisements really are good ways to make the products seem much better than they really are .especially in this modern scociety and during this commercial and valued time .during the history of china , there had been some kinds of advertisements in the big citys : such as the changan city of empreor tang .some owners of the resturants putted the list and the main ingredients of the meals out of the house to attract the customers .sometimes they cooked the meals in the front of the restruants and asked the customers to taste the meals for free .accturally , these free foods were very delicious and enough for many people to eat , but if the customers entered the restruants and ordered the same food , they would find the food s taste is just so so .that is the difference between advertisements and the real products .the products in the advertisements are allways seemed better than the products really are .to tell the truth , i really like to watch the advertisements of the make-up and orther beauty products from tv or newspapers .but i will not buy a product immediatly when i see a new advertisement .because i do nt know if the product is really like what the advertisement says .i often ask for some samples of the product or ask my friends about it .i think it may avoid the risk of hurt myself .anyway , the women s face is very important .adervertisment r
