learning facts are important as well as learning and understanding idea and concepts .but i strongly agree with this statement on how important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .that is because if students learn the idea and understand the concept that means they can use those idea as some kind of example to solve an answer .for example , students can learn about fact , but when it is time for them to use what they have learned like tests or in some kind of social events , even if they know about the fact they wo nt be able to solve those problems .in math tests students need to know how the procedure works in order to solve for the answer .but what if students know only the facts ?`` division was discovered by . ..etc .these kind of facts wo nt help students to score well on their tests .if students learn only facts , they wo nt be able to make their own hypotenuse or to learn how to study new enviornments by themsleves .most college professors learned the basic , in this case the idea and concept of how the things work out and why they got that solution .if they did nt learn the idea and concept of what they learned and only learned the facts , they would nt have any idea what their doing during their new experiments or researchs .learning new facts are waste of time .people can learn facts while they learn and study idea and concepts .reason why that is possible is that because through learning idea and concepts people can end up learning few or more of new facts from their experiences .so if students understand idea and concepts that means they are learning facts alone and without teachers yelling at them .when teachers teach students the idea and concepts more than facts , students will probably do better in academically and socially .that is why i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
