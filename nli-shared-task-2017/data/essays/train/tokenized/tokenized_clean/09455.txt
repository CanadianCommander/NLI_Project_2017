i absolutely agree with the fact that many advertisements make products seem special , even though , maybe , they are not .i understand that the purpose of an advertisement is to actually show the product with its best qualities , but i think that many times this is nt really what is done .first of all , it is frequent that the advertisement presents the product as the best one on the market , comparing it with other similar types in commerce .for example , there are dish washing soaps that are presented as miracolous , but i do nt think that they would actually be able to dissolve all the grease and dirt on a frying pan , after the preparation of a bacon and eggs breakfast .in addition , behind the preparation of an advertisement there are many people , such as designers for graphics , music experts for the sound and so on .all these persons work to make the advertisement as appealing as possible .they know the target of people who to direct , and who will probably be the future buyers , and consequently study a way to show the product that will be specially interesting for those .the third reason why i think that advertisements are not always straightforward is that many companies decide to pay a famous person , such as an actor or a singer , to make their product more popular .in this way all the fans of this person would be encouraged to buy what he or she is presenting .i think that no woman on earth could resist from buying a jewel presented next to brad pitt s face .in conclusion , i think that people should be aware of these strategies and decide wether to buy the product or not just thinking by themselves , ignoring the sometime `` false  advertisements .
