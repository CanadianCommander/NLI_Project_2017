helping communities is a great thing to do and there are many people involved in this `` job  with the aim of substaining and helping as much as they can .usually this help comes from the curches and from the charity associations as a volunteers  occupation and it s very useful and gratefying .but if we look with more accurancy we can see that the people that works there , are usually middle age - old people that thing that spending more time there is better than wating time .so it s true that the young people do nt do enough for their communieties .instead of staying hours in front of the computers waiting for something more interesting they should go out and do something useful and important for their communietes .it is nt an hard work .for example , it means going to the church s playfield and help the mothers to control their children , help an old woman to buy her dinner at the supermarket or help an old man to take his dog out .frankly it s nothing so difficult to do .personally i think that working in charity shops or helping people in difficult it s more gratefying than how they think .these stuations should help them to be more sensitive in front of these people but especially to understand the importance of their occupation .this way a young boy/girl is going to face the real problems and the real situations that could happen during their lives .and i think that there is nothing better to be prepared about what could happen in the future .
