once i took an oral exams and it was not going as well as i expected .in the end the professor said to me : `` i can see you have learned the topic but you have not studied it !what did he mean with this sentence ?well , i learned all the facts and examples from his lecture but during the exam i couldn  t transfer them to the systems he asked me about - it just was nt enough .so if someone asks me if it was more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than merely learning facts .i would tell him the following : depending in which field you are studying in facts and numbers change very rapidly over the years , so getting the whole concepts might be the better approach .then it is very easy to get certain facts using the world wide web , but getting the right use out of them or find the right application is a thing you have to learn and be trained with .and then , if you understand the idea behind a process rather than learning the dull facts , the knowledge is preserved much better within your brain .most important of all if you get the ideas and concepts you can derive abstract methods that can adopted to new situations and systems .therefore they are more valuable than mere facts .but as always it is nt as black and white as it may seem in the first place .allthough i would put the stress on understanding the whole picture more than just the details , facts and examples can help you especially during the learning process .in the end ideas and concepts backed with a few numbers and examples give you a round profile and help you being a good student and becoming a competent worker , scientist , engineer or what else you choose to become .
