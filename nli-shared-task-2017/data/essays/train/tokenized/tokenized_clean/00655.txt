most of young peoples nowadays , for some reasons like selfesh manner and the entertainment which is available 24 hours , dont really give enough time in order to help their communities .first , with the availability of the t.v. twenty four hours a day it might be uncommon that a boy or a girl may think of helping his or her community .t.v. programs , either good or bad ones , attract young peoples , regardless of the movies , which takes the first place of attracting the youngs in most countries .this attraction may cause a little careless in theirselves toward their community .further more , the attitude plays a huge part in this particular situation .it depends actually on the parents who should plant the love toward the society inside a boy s heart ; for example , when you teach a child from his childhood how to love his country , it will be obvios that he will grow up up with a quantity of love will be indirectly translated into a care toward his country when he grow up , which means giving some time to fix some mistakes and help some people .in addition , the socity could lead a person to work and help his country and community and may not ; for example , if a person lives in a generous , freindly , and ready to work together society , he would propably become helpful to his society sooner or later .the contrast is true , when the people in a particular society do nt care about each other then we shouldn expect a guy show up and say he want to help .in conclusion with the avilablity of the entertainments any time at any place , movies which increases every day and the attitude of the person himself , the time for helping the community becomes rare .all these abstracted issues have directly or indirectly leads the young boys far a way from helping and lood after thier community , which is a petty .
