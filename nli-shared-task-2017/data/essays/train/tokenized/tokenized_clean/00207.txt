most people are considering which is better for them between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and having knowledge in one specific subject .some people say that having knowledge in one specific subjet is more useful for people , because they can study much deeply about a certain subject .however , i strongly claim that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is much better .that s because it is easy for you to talk with many people about diverse subjects and you can look more intelligent than any other person .first of all , if i have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , there are many common talking subjects with others .that means , i can easily get closed to other people .when people share their thoughts about common things , they easily get closed .from my personal experience , one of my friends , soccer player , who well knows only about soccer , always used to talk about soccer .whenever we met , he talked how to play soccer and there are many soccer rules which you do not know yet .as time goes by , i became to deny him .in this repect , having broad knowledge of many academic is better than having knowledge in a certain subject .on top of that , a person who having broad knowledge of many academic looks more intelligent person .if i have knoledge only in one specific subject , i can expalin about that part very well .however , i can not speak confidently about other areas .my cousins are good example to expain this .one cousin studied very well and bacame a doctor .the other studied not well , but he tried to learn knowledge of many areas .he also changed his job many times .a few days ago , we gathered to see and talked about many things .as the topics are changing , the cousin who have broad knowlege of many academic subjects gave me many advices and expained about whatever i did not exactly know .however , the other did not say much to me except for one subject , medical problems .in conclusion , i believe that having broad knowledge is much better because it help for you to get closed with others and to look more intelli
