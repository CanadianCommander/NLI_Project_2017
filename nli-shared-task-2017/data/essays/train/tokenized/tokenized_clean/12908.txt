i agree with the following statement .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in addition , in my opinion , it is hard to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .to learn facts , the students do not need to have their own ideas , they just remember these facts and it is really hard because the facts do not have any backgrounds , concepts , and ideas .for example , in the history class , i often just remember the facts , like what happened in 1945 , i just remembered a lot of events in the text books without thinking .as i thought , i got a great score on the test but a few days later , i forgot these events that i remembered .i did not understand about the events at all , just remembered them for the tests .i think this is not leanig or studying .i think every things have reasons and results .when i am interested in something that i have not known i always think of the reasons and results , not the facts .for instance , in history class , the theacher taught me many things which have been happened and many people who affected to many things .i preffer to think about why they did so than what is happened because there is many reasons and jenerally it is so complex .it is really interesting to me and i noticed that if i could understand their ideas , concepts or details , i never forget these memories .i was really interested in japanese history and especially , ryouma sakamoto .he is really famous person in japan and he has many strategies for life .i researched about him and his effects , and i think i could understand his ideas and comsepts .now , i never forget about him because i could understand his ideas and concepts , not only things that he did .if people want to understand something correctly and deeply , i think people should to understand the ideas and concepts , not only facts .
