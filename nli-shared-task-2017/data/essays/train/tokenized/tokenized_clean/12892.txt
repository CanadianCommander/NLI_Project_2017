many believe that in the earlier stage of life , you are most likely to have more ` fun  than that of in the later stage .there is even a saying in korea which says , when translated , ` enjoy life whilst you re still young !.my opinion on this topic is that , people s enjoyment in life does nt depend on the age of that human being , but the perspective , experiences they have encountered , and the situation the people are in .my reasons for believing this is because firstly , personally looking at my parents , hearing their experiences of their daily-lives , i picture happy , laughing , relaxed people , not stressed over homework , projects , tests , what they re going to be later on in their life , or their duties in the house .occasionally i even wish i was a fully grown person , to have a job , and not stress over of choosing what job i m going to get .i believe that i am not the only one who has ideas simliar to this , especially 12th grade students , who are preparing to play their role as a fully grown adult in the society .secondly , sometimes when my parents have too much to do , they tend to look at my sister and i and say something along the lines of ` you are very lucky to be so young , not to have any worries or concerns on the problems of the real world  .they say that they wish they could go back in time and re-live their lives as an adolesence .summing up , i think that every human being has a different opinion on this topic whether old or young , affected by their personal experiences , the environment around them , and the situations they are in .a young one may look like they  re enjoying life to another older person , and visa versa .
