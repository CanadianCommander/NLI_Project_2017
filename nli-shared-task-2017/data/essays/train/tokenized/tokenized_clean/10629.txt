advertising is a media by which people come to know about new market .new market means new type of products , new models etc .only by believing the content of advertisement , people go for shopping .so advertisements always try to draw full attention of it s audience .they do this to improve their sales .sometimes , the advertisements may contain false information .the advertisers should try to impress people but not give wrong information about their product .take the example of a cocacola soft drink company .scientists proved that the products of cocacola drinks contain some pesticides .so all people stopped drinking of cocacola products .their market went down .again , after some months the company came out .the company started adevertising by famous heros .so the fans of that hero believed his statement mentioned in advertisement and again started drinking cocacola products .indirectly , the advertisement challenged the proof of scientists .some educated people may be confused in such situations .they may lose impression on advertisements .most adevertisers show their products much better than they really are .i can explain this with my personal experience .i bought one `` anti-dandruff  shampoo after i saw one advertisement .according to the advertisement , it should remove total dandruff in 4 weeks .i used according to the insructions mentioned on the label .but i didnot find any improvement even after 4 months .sometimes people may be misguided by these type of advertisements .advertisements should not contain false information .it should reflect the real authenticity of the product .then only , people get good impression on advertisements .most people , while watching television always try to skip advertisements .because they know that they are fake advertisements .they may either change the channel for a while or they may engage in other work for that period .the companies choose the advertising as a messenger to increase their market and to get some identity in people about their product .so they should be designed in such a way to get good impression by people .
