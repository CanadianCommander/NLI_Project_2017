human changes from decade to another .their technology get improved , and also their birth grow more than before .the population in this time will be differ than the comming one .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , since the population is increasing , and that will cause a lot of traffic problems such as crowded street , and the way of transportation .we can solve this problem by using trains and planes more than cars .in the other hand , people will not buy cars more if they face a lot of trafic crowd .while the population is increasing , i think there will be a new laws , and restriction of using cars .also , the tax will increase on the people who have more than enough of cars in their home .people will go smoothly for the trains and planes for their transporations .this will reduce the crowd , and they can arrive quickly without facing any troubles .also , the development of the technology will increase , and the people will go to the technology and they will not take care of the cars .according to my writing , i agree with this statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today  .the live is in progress and will never stop , and it will come complicated .
