successful people want to try new things and take risks , instead of doing what they already know to do well , and this for these two main reasons .the first reason is that it is one of the mankind caracteristics .since the homo erectus , human beings try new things and take risk to develop themselves .for example , at the beginning the first pre-human lived in trees because it was a safe place .and since they had jumped off their trees , they had discover many useful things and had known an great evolution .they had taken risks , instead of staying on their trees like monkeys , which allowed them to made great discoveries .if the human being is at this level , it is because some of them tried new things and made some breaktroughs .for example galille , took a lot of risk when he propose his therory of a round earth turning around the sun .and he could have trust the old therory which were saying that the earth was like a plate , but he did it to improve the scientifical knowledge .the second reason , is that successful people are getting bored when they always do the same things , because they seem too easy .so , to have a challenge they try new things to discover new difficulties or feelings which can lead to the progress of the person or of the community .for example , ellen mc arthur knows how to sail on a river or on a lake , but for her there is no challenge doing it .she prefers doing things the had never done before , like doing the round of the earth .this is true for sport in general .its is the motivation of every athlete to go every time further , to push its own limits .as a conclusion we could say that it is thanks to these successful people if human being has reached this point of evolution .and it is not finished yet .
