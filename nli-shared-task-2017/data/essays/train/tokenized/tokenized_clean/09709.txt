in tweety years , there will be fewers cars in use than there are today .in order to explain this topic , we can show that this is a controversary point , depend on which condition you look at this situtation .first of all , it s easy to think that the automobile industry is growing up very quickly , and there is more and more car on the road .this certainly du to the increasing of the price of the train and plan ticket this last ten years .but , you can tell , that ingenior in the industry try to change this problem , not by trying to reduce the car industry , but by trying to find a new way not to polute the planet , like by biocarburant .furtheremore , it s nearly impossible to avoid people to use their car , like for working people , or people living far away .and in addition , today , having a car , is also to be part of the social world , to be autonom .however , you can also tell that the future of cars is not clear .when you see the fast evolution of all the other way to be drived .furthermore , lots of people prefere public transport as a cheaper way to go to work , and gouvernments understood this and is developping this , like in hong kong , where you can do everything without anycar , or in london , where the city does nt allowed any car .or even in strasbourg were the french gouvernement make cheaper ticket in order to encourage people to let their car at home .in addition , we can not planned clearly in which way the world will evolute .if you take as an example developped country , because it s the one who will be more affected by this matter , you can already tell how they already try to developpe other way to move in and outside of their country .take as an example , the train developement and the decrease of the price in some compagny helped by gouvernment .in order to conclude about the evolution of the number of car in use in the road in tweenty years , in my opinion , i can say i agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road , this due to the evolution of the population .but with the news technologies , the bad effect of this in the environment and as a bigger scale in the planet , can be reduce , which is a good point , and as a matter of fact that the petrol ressources in the world became really rare , which can be a real turn in the car industry , i hope in the good way .
