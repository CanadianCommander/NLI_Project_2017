some peple agree to the statement because the duty of young people is consentrate on studying at school .however , i think three much beneficial points for youong peple to give enough time to helping their communities .the first reason is that young people helping their communities can experience not at their school .they may go to the house whitch the elderly person lives , and help to eat food and walk .and they may be babysitters , and be able to study how to deal with baby .those experiences are not given from schools .the second reason is that helping their communities bring many friends who are not belonged to their schools .from my experience , when i was high school student , i paricipated in the english education school for children of my community .i made many friends who are not high school student , and they are now the best friend for me .the third reason is that peple can not make times to help their community when peple work in company .so , young peple , who have much free times than workers , should pay much time to help their community .terefore i disagre to young peple do not give enough time to helping their communities .there are much better to belong the community .
