like we have learned from the book entitled `` the end of history  , in wich the author held the thesis that after the fall of berlin wall the history had come to an end , trying to make forecasts on such a long period as 20 years is very dangerous , but i feel fair comfortable with saying that such a diffused mean of transportation as the car will not disappear in two decades , and even that the number of cars will actually increase .the car is the engine of modern economy , because it allows fast travel , which in turn means that people with the right knowledge or skill can be quickly and easily collected in the place where they are needed , thus rendering easy both to use their existing knowledge and to build new .i am thinking about workers commuting to their job places or professors reaching universities by car .public transport has proved inable to be a full substitute of cars in this role , and as new economic powers like china and india emerge from poverty they will develop their car population as rich countries have already done , and this process will take more than 20 years , in my opinion , so that the number of cars will keep increasing over this period .of course my analisys can not foresee an eventual tecnological revolution that could render the car useless , like the car has done with horses in the twentieth century , or a major economic breakdown which would render cars too expensive to be useful , but such trend breaking events are unpredictable .if the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be asserted that it will take more than twenty years for the number of cars to start decreasing , if it will ever do so .
