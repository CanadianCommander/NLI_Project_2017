whether it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide or just by your own , has both advantages and disadvantages depending on many factors or characteristics of the trip .three importants factors are : the amount of money the person has , for how much time he will be travelling , and the personal oppinion about flexibility .firstly , hireing a tour guide can be very expensive and , in some cases , much more expensiver that travelling alone .for example , it is free to go through paris walking on your own , and it can be very expensive to pay for a group tour .nonetheless , you will probably need to buy a guide if you do not want to miss the important places .it is cheaper to walk on your own only if the guide is not as expensive as the tour .secondly , a guided tour works better for someone who has not got too much time to visit a place .in this case , he will have someone to take him to the unmissable places and to give him some explanations .on the other hand , if someone has , for example , three month to visit two cities , he will probably have time to get around on his own , ask for some advise to different local people and see or visit much more different places than the number of places he would visit on a guided group tour .the third factor has to do with preferences .people have different oppinion about how much flexibility they like to have when they are travelling , and there is not only one correct or a best oppinion .some people like to have a schedule that details every place they will visit , and what they will do every day .however , other people like to feel free to do what they feel like doing on each day , depending , for example , on their mood .in spite of the fact that a person can make a detailed schedule when travelling alone , on guided tours , people are usually less free to do what they feel like doing on that day .in conclusion , there is not one best way to travel .everyone can have their own best way depending on their personal characteristics and on the trip they are planning to take .therefore , each person has to decide whether to travel in a group with a tour guide or by their own .
