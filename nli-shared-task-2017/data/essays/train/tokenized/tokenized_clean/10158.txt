i do agree to the statement that it is better to know many things briefly rather than knowing only few things in detail .there are so many different academic subjects that hardly no one is able to have a deep knowleadge of all of them at the same time .knowing a bit of many subjects is more worth because it makes you look at things more widely .also i think it is more worth because you become open minded .you do not only focus on few things but consider many different aspects you have learned about .another argument to underline my opinion is that you have better conversations with people by knowing many things briefly .on the one hand it is great to have a deep knowleadge of something and of cause it is also very impressing .however on the other hand i think as that kind of person you can only have a good conversation with specialists like you .you are not able to see things in a big picture .to my mind having a brief knowleadge about many academic subjects is more worth it .to give an example imagine you are having a conversation in a train or another public place with a person you have just met .the chance that this person has the same knowleadge and same interests you do so you have somehing to talk about is very low .but if you have lots to talk about because you know a lot , does not matter if it is just a basic knowleadge or not , the conversation would be very good .to sum up it is just more worth and helpful in life to have a brief knowleadge about academic subjects because the chance you find somebody you can talk to is very high .also very important is that you experience a lot and become open minded which to my mind you can only become if you have a wide knowleadge .
