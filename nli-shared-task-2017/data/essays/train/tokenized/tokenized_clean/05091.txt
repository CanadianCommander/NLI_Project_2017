nowadays , there are ongoing statesments which people have to learn only one subject specific or learn several subjects .somepeople think that people have to learn one subject in detail , because if people go out to social they definitely attend company which is related with they major .however , i firmly believe that people have to learn many academic subjects .there are two reasoens which is comunicated with another field people and understand how world goes .first , if people learn several fields knowledge , we can communicate with another field person .most of people think we do not use another knowledge when we get a jod .however it his a misleading information .for example , if my job is accoutant , i always met several job person such as sometimes i will meet bank job person , sometime i will meet proffessor .if i met another feild of person , i should talk something such as familiar with meeting person .in that case if i just talk about one specific subject , they will definitely boring .if we learn several knowledge , we can know more several fields person in our life .another reason is that it is hard to know how our country goes .a lot of news talk about several field story such as economy , biology .according to cho-sun daily news which is published in korea .they reseach who can understand the news more correctly .they made two groups .one is accuately learn one subject specific , and another group learn many academic subject .in conclusion of this research , 73 percent of the latter group people can understand the new more correctly .in conclsion , as i mentioned above , i agree that broad knoledge of many acdemic subjects are more better than learn one specific subjects .
