learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts are actually the most significant elements for students but i agree with the given statement and think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .i think there are some reasons make students behave this way .first of all , we are all in a very competitive school environment and we have to get high grades at school .in order to get high grades we have to study very hard .but while we are studing we see that the ideas and concepts are more in important in the exams than the facts .i maen the teachers ask us about the specific methods , ideas or the concepts rather than the truths or facts .therefore in order to be successful we deal with the important points of the exams and it is certain that ideas and concepts are more important in the exams .i can say that i do the same thing and i deal with the concepts and ideas more than i care about to learn facts .secondly i can frankly indicate that today students are lazy .learning the facts need more skills like critical thinking , assessing the issues and clarifying the different aspects of them and etc. but on the other hand understanding the methods , idaes or concepts is something more easier .to be able to understand the ideas or concepts you do not have to think of it detailly , you can only study the course materials and maybe memorize them .thus i can suggest that understanding the ideas is more easier for students than learning the facts .that is why they find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .another element make students feel this way is the education system .i can give examples from my country .in turkey the education system leads students to feel and behave this way .for instance in our history courses they just make us to memorize the ideas and the concepts instead of giving us information and background about the facts .we memorize the dates of the wars or important events during the reign of a sultan but unfortunately we can not deal with the realities .hence i can indicate that education system is a very basic and significant element at this issue .all in all , it is cartain that students find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts but i hope one day it will change and we will start thinking of the facts more than we do today .i think this will be a very significant milestone in students education life and more creative and good skilled young students will be trained .
