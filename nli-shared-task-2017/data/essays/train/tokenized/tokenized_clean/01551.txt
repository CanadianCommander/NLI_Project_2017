this question has been raise for a long time now , to answer this question another question must be raise : how do u define enjoy life ?is it the activity you do ?is it your state of emotions ?young people enjoy life as much as old people but in a very differnt way , that often appear to be stronger .as a young person most of the time you try to spend your free time at full speed , most of the activities asociated with enjoyment are spend in outdoors at tha age .i remeber as a young child i spend most of my free time riding bycicles , riding skateborad . ..and so on .a good day for me was a day where i could tied , exausted .that what most peolpe think when they see kids play around all day .for older people the sence of enjoyment is more define with reflection , taking the time to relax .as i can see myself today by getting older , my point on view on situation change , i spend more time now on intellectual refection ( sush as books , phylosophy . . )and get more pleasure from little thing , such as kindness form others . ..older people enjoy life with less physical activities .the emjoyment of life for older people is less noticable then young people because they do not have the same point of attraction .so for outsiders young people will always enjoy life more than older .
