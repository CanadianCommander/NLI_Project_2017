in my point of view , i beleive that tours itself are for a purpose .in order to make them worthful , guidance is necessary .overriding reason for my beleive is that , tours teach us more than the books .most of the tours are based either on learning something , which is unknown or simply an historic purpose .some places of interest may contain different kinds of monuments and articles in the meusum s that have lasted from our ancestors period .in such a visit , the tour guides help us understand the importance of it .they make us deeply learn the facts of each of the articles that were preserved and tha reason behind it .moreover , the tours guides also create an environment of fun and joy .in tours that are for an official purpose , they help us in directing the best ways to reach on time .later , they take us to the famous places in the city like shopping malls and multicuisine restaurants etc .apart from all this , tours of educational purposes like for instance , study on birds , trees etc , in forests they guide us about the safe and the unsafe locations , so that we can caution ourself while moving around .finally , i assume that by travelling with a guide would help us a lot , because they spend their valuable time for us .and not the least , travelling in a group gives lots of fun and entertainment and
