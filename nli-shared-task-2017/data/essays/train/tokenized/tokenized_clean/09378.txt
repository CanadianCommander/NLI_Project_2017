i agree that students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .it is that this statement is for students .do you think about it that if students does nt like study for themselves .it makes big problems .first , if students does nt understand or misunderstand , it makes to go wrong way to students .students want to know knew impormations , but they do nt understand well about knw impormations .so , they need teacher who makes to understand them .if it does nt important for students , students do nt have attention .so they become that they does nt like attention about new ideas .secondly , they want to interesting study .if students does nt understand ideas , it is that their class is not interesting to them .i experience about that , too .when i was highschool student , i do nt like english because my english teacher alway hit me with my grade .i want to study english but my teacher did nt .he always do quizes and tests and he hit me with their grades .i think it is problem that it is exept to understand .finally , in school , students wnat to play without study .because their subjects are without understanding .for example , korea has many academies for that they help students can go unversity .academies teach interesting more than schools .and they teach fast more than schools .so , schools are bouring to students .students always sleep in school and after school , they study hard in academy .it is wrong education system ,in conclution , understanding is important more than learn facts for students .it will decide their futures and contries destinies .we offer for their futures .it is that our future become to go good way .
