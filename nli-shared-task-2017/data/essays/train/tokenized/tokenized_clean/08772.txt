i respectfully disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .i see that many of my young friends are engaged in something that is ultimately aimed to helping their communities .for example , some of them do social work , including helping homeless , elderly people and disables .they want to feel socially useful and helping the others ultimately make them feel closer to the community they live in .they are so enthusiastic about their social work that they try to make as much time as possible to dedicate to it .i have done and continue to do social work myself .however , time is never enough , particularly if one considers that social work is generally unpaid .my friends and i do social work in our spare time .in fact all of us have different main jobs , which are important to pay the bills ( but working to pay the bills is not always just enough ) .some other friends of mine are engaged in local politics .they believe that they can change their society in a way that is more suitable to their values and reality .they have therefore decided to play an active role in shaping local politics .this is not an easy task , at least where i come from .existing politics belong to a different generation and generally view younger people as too unexperienced for politics .on the contrary , i see young people s political commitment as just another way to helping their communities .and is nt it true that politics should be the expression of democracy and participation of all citizens ( including young people ) to our society ?on the basis of these examples , taken out of my personal experience , i believe that young people more and more try to find time to helping their communities , because they want to change the reality they live in .however , my experience may well be different from other realities and other parts of the world , where the participation of young people in their communities is limited .i feel that helping their communities can be very rewarding for young people who make time for that .at least this is what i have seen in my own experience .
