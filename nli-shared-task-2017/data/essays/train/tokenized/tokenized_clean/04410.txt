i fully agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .in my mind advertisement is just the invention of some smart business managers who wanted to increase the money they make through the selling of their product .of course advertisement is also a possibility for a company to present their product to a wide range of people through television .but i am of the opinion that , if they would tell the truth about their product less people would buy it .they have to make people believe that their product is the best product that they could buy , and that it would improve their lifes .i think especially products such as washing powder seem much better in the advertisement than they really are .do we not all know the advertisement about the `` new incredible washing powder  that is able to clean all our clothes and make them look brand new ?there are so many of the advertisements that claim that they have found the solution for our daily problems .honestly , i have to say that none of these products ever worked as good as it should work .it is a well-known fact , that most of the people believe in the advertisements .the companies use the belief of the people that it is not allowed to lie .everybody knows from his parents that it is not polite to lie and so the people think that the advertisement can not be wrong .i also noticed that the people who produce these clips use the lack of knowledge of the people .in germany there is a clip for yoghurt with sugar from fruits .for the people who do not know about fruit sugar , this yoghurt seems much healthier than a normal yoghurt does .a lot of parents want to give their children something healthy and therefore they buy this kind of yoghurt .if my mother has nt told me that fruit sugar is almost as unhealthy as normal sugar , i would also have believed that this product is much better .especially this information from my mother made me believe that most of the products seem better in the advertisement than they really are .
