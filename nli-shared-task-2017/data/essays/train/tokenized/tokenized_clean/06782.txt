because i am a collage student now in taiwan , and have a deep feeling of this situation that being indifferent about the environment around us .i must give some explanation that why we students in our generations are fail to have time helping our communities .we students in taiwan are brought up by an attitude of life without caring about the environment around us , in a brief , we are growing in an selfish attitude even though the text book had taught us we should devote ourself while we can .most of time , we studying all the time to get good grades and burdened with so many pressure on studying .as a result , even we want to help our own communities , we are really lack of time helping .some times i can see some clubs in campus which are tend to devote themselves in the servise of community , and it really have a great impact on those residents .but what i can see are just a small group of willing people .after all , what we students considered most now is how to get relax from our pressure and have fun for our limited young life , because we are pressed under the lines in the textbook .take me for example , it seems i should enjoy my college student life .but i will graduate next year , and i am faced the pressure to apply the grauduate , i even do nt have time to relex because there are so many chores such as millions of assignments and lots of part-time job tasks for me to deal with .how can i arrange my schedule to devote myself to community ?i agree on this statement that young people do nt give enough time to help their own communities , but i think it is the education that cause this situation being indifferent about helping communities .in my opinion , if we have the hopes that our future generation have a passion to help others , we should teach them this attitude totally from their childhood .
