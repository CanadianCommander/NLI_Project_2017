nowadays , some people argue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .for some people , we are living in a very competitive world and this is a natural concequence .in my opinion , this is done on purpose .first of all , there are lots of types of products on the market and consumers have sometimes difficulty in finding the right one .in these kind of situations advertisements play an important role .people tend to buy the products which they have seen on television commercials or print advertisements .however , when people buy the product , sometimes they see that it is different from the advertisement or it is not as good as the one on television .indeed , companies try to show their products better than they are ,secondly , there is a great competition between companies .some companies know that their products are really good and they state it on their advertisements .on the other hand , some companies are aware of the quality of their products and they know that they can only compete with the good ones if they use advertisements efficiently .in other words , if they do not claim that their products are good on an advertisement people will buy other products .this means loosing profits for them .furthermore , people tend to buy the products which they see on television .owners of the companies know this fact and behave accordingly .they try to use their advertisements to make people learn their products and buy them .besides , they try to influence them by making their products seem much better .in my conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they are and people do it on purpose to sell more products and to gain more profits .i think these are normal results of such a consumer based and competitive market .
