having broad knowledge of many subjects does not lead to a good future .whereas specializing in a particular subject in more beneficial nowadays .i completely disagree to the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjets than to specialise in one specific subject .nowadays there is demand for professinals , who know their job very well and can handle any task in a particular field .people who have broad knowledge about many academic subjects , do not actually know what field they really want to master in and so they have knowledge about many subjects .it is very well said `` a jack of all trades is a master of none .so this implies that to be a master or to actually achieve what you desire you need to be pragmatic and should know what is neccesary for you to achieve what you desier for yourself .i have even seen many people who have degrees in many fields but still do not have what they want for themselves .for example , one of my friend s elder brother has many degrees in different field and has alot of knowedge about many different academic subject , but he still does not have an aim or a particular direction to move in .whereas one of my cousins had a masters degree in computers , which was his favorite subject from his school days and then got a proper job with proper status and a respectful social life .it is not bad to have vast knowledge , but having vast vast knowledge in many different fields , stops you from being interested in a particular field .it is not only that having vast knowledge is important what is more important is to be more smarter and choos a specific field to major in .thus i would say that specialising in a particular subject is more beneficial than having fast knowledge of various subjects .as , now you are wanted to be more knowledgeable about your subject , then it does not matter how much you know about other subjects .
