some people prefer to divide theirselves to several areas and know a little thing about many subjects while others prefer to get deeply information on one subject .based on my experiences i strongly believe that a person should specialize in one subject .there will never be enough time to get deep knowledge of all the subjects and there are several advantages of specialzing in one subject , easiness to reach success and live iin a more organized way and it unfortunately there is a big time problem in recent years .i mean there is a lot of things to do but not enough time for them .people should use their time very economically .trying to get knowledge in many different areas is a big time lost ; moreover it is a challenging idea .due to the high responsibilities there will never be enough time to really understand all of the topics , no one is so intelligent .in addition , i do nt believe that a person can reach success by giving his or hers interest in different areas .i had such a friend that encountered such a situation .we werw at the same class , he get everytime high grades .then he decided to study architecture beside chemical engineering and at the same time he played guitar in a bar .after this decision his grades declined significiantly : moreover he loosed his job because he was so tired and could nt give good performances .to be an accomplished worker a person should have detailed information of his subject .without knowing all the aspects of a subject no one can do a good job .because he or she would nt have appropriate knowledge to use when heor she confronts a problem .a person is going to live in a more organized way by studying one subject , because all the things that he has to do during a day will be fixed .there will not be any disorders to disrupt his day .in conclusion i prefer to specialize in one susject rather than having broad knowledge of many subjects because i believe that there are sqarce time to deal with many subjects , it is easier to reach succsses
