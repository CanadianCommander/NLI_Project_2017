i agree with the statement that students have to get the ideas and concepts than just learning facts .the learning will be more effective , improves their brain work , and the lifestyle can change posetive .first , the learning would be more efficient .students have to think and understand to get the ideas and concepts .and this process makes them think why the facts happen and gives them a purpose to learn .in consquence , they will apply that on every learning .for example , in science class , there are many kind of principles students need to understand , and thinking why this principle happen will make the student curious .that way leads the student more participate in class and has fun in learning .it will be much better for the student to think by himself ( herself ) rather than just being taught the fact and try to remember .also , it will improve their brain working by understand the concepts .they learn how to think logically and from that they get good grades at objects like math , science , physics , and so on .not only the school grades but also the brain work will improve and the student could be more intelligent .for instance , the one who have always thought about the ideas and the concepts and the one who has nt have a big difference in the quality of knowledge .finally , students lifestyle can change .they can get more posetive then they were .thinking logically or hard definitely creates a good mind .and those who do can easily get calm down and get relaxed .especially when they get angry , they can get stop arguing and start to think about solving the problem .therefore , i agree that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .it makes the learning more effective , improves their brain , creates a posetive mind .for these reasons i agree with the statement .
