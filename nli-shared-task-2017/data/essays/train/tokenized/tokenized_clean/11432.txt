it is true that young people enjoy life much more that older people do and i support this statement entirely .we have to however , realize that we maybe refering to a specific time period and different stage of age-groups at different times , this may include one s years of adolescence or even the teenage years .as an adult with a family to look after , there are a lot of additional responsibilities that are thrust onto one s shoulders .as a younger person there maybe the academic pressure that one has to cope up with but not a problem as such .afterall , it is the duty of every child to study .the adults are incorporating into their lives what they have already learnt , while the younger are still in the process of learning the basic tricks of the trade .learning however , is a never ending process .as a younger person , there is always a tendancy to experiment .sometimes this may prove to be successful or may lead to failure .the whole point is that as a younger person , we are at an immature stage in our lives and things may not affect us that adversely and this is a big advantage and a huge motivational factor to go out and try different things .after all as said by george bernard shaw in his famous play pygmalion , `` what is a life but a series of inspired follies .younger people have a lot more freedom , in the sense that they have a much wider curriculum and whole lot of facilities to avail off , which our elders could have only dreamt of having in their time .ofcourse there is no shortcut to success and the required amount of hardwork has to be put in , only we are luckier that we have access to better and quicker resources to consult .a great example could be taken from within a school community itself .the senior-junior relationship .as a junior there is not much expected out of one , except a good academic , which goes for everyone across the board .as a senior one may be vested with great power , and with great power comes great authority and greater responsibility .it is really surprising , yet true to see such a major shift of responsiblity even among a smaller group .school is however only a micro-cosm of the world and this is how the heirarchy is maintained the world over .the younger lot have no tension as such .the younger one s always have a much relaxed attitude towards towards life and its other various aspects as well , and why shouldnt they , there is the right time for everything and as they grow older the burden of responsibility will get to them .life at a younger stage is much more relaxed and stress-free .as an adult one may be dealing in a very rigorous and challenging climate , with a lot of intense competition , however , different than that of a younger person .thus , i can conclude by saying that the younger lot do enjoy life a lot more than the older people do .
