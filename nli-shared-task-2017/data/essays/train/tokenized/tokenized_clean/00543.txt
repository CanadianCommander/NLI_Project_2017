the issue at hand is young people enjoy life more than older people do or not .i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .i believe that older people like life more than young people do because of many reasons .first of all , old people enjoy life more than younger person do because they know they are much close to death .they know very well the meaning of death and they will die in anytime .because of this reason , they try to spend their rest of life very effectively .on the other hand , young people feel that they ever do nt die and because of this reason they do nt aware the value of life .additionally , old people like life more than younger because they have many reasons to enjoy life .for example , they generally have children and a wife .they need to care about them .they enjoy life because of her family .on the other hand , young people do not have a doughter or son .they are single .because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life , they do not enjoy life more than older people .finally , i think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectations from life are not generally big .they generally expect quiet place in peace with their family .this is enough for them to enjoy the life .on the other hand , as i am a young man , i have many expectations from life and if i do nt obtain any of them , i will easily hate from life and i will be depresed .i expect a good job , much money , brand new car . ..it is very difficult to obtain all of them at the same time and due to these reason most of time i do nt enjoy from life .ultimately , i believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .i believe this because , the life will end for them in a very short time later , they have many things to do and many people to care , and they do nt have a lot of expectations from the life .
