i remember an tv-ad about some kind of perfume which , once applied on your body , could bring you all the beautiful girls or boys that you may have dreamed of .i bought it and i can assure you that it does not work !maybe i was abused by the advertising but for sure , but in my view the advertisement tends to overstate the main features of a product , and i will give the main reasons for that .first , the main goal of an advertisement - and it is also the aim of marketing - is to promote a good or a service in order to increase its sales .as a consequence , the presentation of the product could not be fair in a sense .indeed , i am quite certain that if a tv-ad shows the weakness of a good or service , in order to be partial , this good or service would be as appealing as the same presented by an ad which shows only the good aspects of it .second , advertisement tends to reach the imaginary part of our person to increase the attractiveness of products .by doing so , consumers are dreaming about such products and idolize them .for instance , you may have the strong desire to buy a luxury car because you have seen it on the tv and it was shown in an ideal place .or you want to book your holidays in a pleasant place because you find the photographs you have seen very beautiful .but in fact the real situation could be , at least , normal .as a conclusion , i do think that the advertisement does not provide a fair image of the products it supports .but it is worthwhile to mention that it depends on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not .
