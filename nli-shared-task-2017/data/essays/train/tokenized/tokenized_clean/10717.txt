`` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .i am strongly agree that ideas and concept is much more important than just learn or remember the facts as it is .although we are surrounded by milliones of billiones of facts , but as a student , i believe that somehow tell them how to fish is better than just give them fishes .undeniable , we have to learn some basic facts in order to do some further explanation or elaboration .ultimately , we go through that much of studies basically is to archieve something .if ours goals were just to learn something , learning facts will be much more easier and effective .but we are not only learning , absorbing , and memorizing ; we are also improving , creating and inventing .for instance , if we just tell a student that sun provides heat and light .he will just tell you as it is .in other hands , if we told the student the ideas and concepts of sun providing heat and light .perhaps here comes different , since the student understand well , he have much more space for him to create or imagine .imagination brings creation .by simply memorizing or learning facts will not prevent the student from further thinking .hence understanding is better than learning .follwing is understanding will give the student better imprint than just by hard learning .people say ,  learn by heart not learn by only head  or  study smart not study hard  .these shows that better concept on a subject will create a newline in study .students will never allowed to say , `` sorry , i forgot  .this is because they are not memorizing hard or just `` swolled  as it is .things that they learned is learn by examples , ideas , and concept .the will simply recall the facts by seeing the examples or relate this to that by ultimately knowing the basic ideas .we are moving to a new world , a whole new era .students are those who support the coming future .they should neither study with only old fashion style nor just forget about tradition .instead of that , they should study in a fusion , a combination way of study .
