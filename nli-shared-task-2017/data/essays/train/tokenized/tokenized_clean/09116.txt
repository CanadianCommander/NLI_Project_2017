the problem we are dealing with is the lake of interest of young people to spend time to helping their communities .it is a big problem that needs to be solved .on the one hand , there is a rising number of requirements young people have to deal with .there are a lot of things to manage .nowadays , young people have to do good results at school or at the university to get a well-paid job later .most of them are expected to make a good career .they often have a lot of hobbies or activities and , last but not least , they also have to manage their social life .all these activities take a lot of time , sure .on the other hand , there must be a solution of the problem , we have to look into its matter .first , there has to be a good time management .young people should learn to spend their time useful .adult people should support the young people with good advices or with more .parents can suggest a usefull activity to their child .they could drive their child to a soccer game and pick him or her up after the game to do some work in the helping center for homeless people , for example .parents also could suggest to work in a local helping-station for animals .it could be interesting work for a child , where it can learn to be responsible and to take care of others .moreover , social work would increase and improve the social skills of a child or a young man or women .that does mean , that this young person may become more able to deal with problems or to solve conflicts in his life .it also could mean that the young person will simply be able to communicate better with others .whereas the young people have already enough to do is actually being debated .despite all sorrows there are a lot of advantages of social work and work for communities .this work does help both sides .
