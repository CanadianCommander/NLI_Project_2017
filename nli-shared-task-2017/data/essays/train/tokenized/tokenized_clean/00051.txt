what we buy ?we are living in a world which is highly industrialized .this industrialization automatically brings the increase in the consumption - consuption in any way such as cars , clothes , machines , etc. - that is why we also face with the advertisement industry .the more we need the material to consume , the more advertised producs we face .thus , those people who are in the business of making advertisements use different types of methods to convince their customers , one is obviously to display their products in a much better way than they are ,to begin with the the techniques used in advertisement making , we generally face with the visual materials on tv or magazine commercials , even on the billboards .the product is displayed in a manner where you can really get fascinated that how the material is really impressive .if we take the advertisement of a mascara , called x , as an example , we can make the scene as : there is always a very beautiful model who uses x and she could make an imressive effects over people with her glorious eyes .an ordinary woman watches this commercial and can not stop herselt to buy a x in order to make her eyes as beasutiful as the model s .however what comes after ?the x can not show the same effect as it has made on the beautiful model .this is really a basic illustration of how the advertisements sometimes forget about the ethical norms .on the other hand some people claim that this is not true for all the cases , there can maybe some loyal companies which wants to be virtuous towards their customers , but their numbers are really quite limited .the main rason for a company to display its product in a better way s to get profit .most of the companies generally have their specific people and project groups who are responsible of making advertisement .furthermore the company is ready to sacrifice a huge amount of money to improve the advertisements of its producs .this is du the fact that they are aware of the future income .they know that if they illustrate their product in a much better way by using different techniques such as paying a lot to the beautiful models , the people can consume more then the normal time .to sum up , although it is unethical for a company to give a different image of its product , they unfortunatetly imply this method .the amount of money they would earn after a good advertisement can block the eyes of the producers /
