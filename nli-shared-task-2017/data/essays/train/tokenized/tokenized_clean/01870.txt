i agree with the statement for a several reasons :1. one may not success at the first try , but eventually if one keeps trying , one will encounter success .unsuccessful people do nt realize that success takes time and effort .they want it to be done at the first time , and that does not always happen !there are several stories about inventors who did not give up and tried several times , even thousands of time !the inventor of the light bulb is one that comes to my mind .imagine what would have happened if he would have given up after all those tries !but he kept trying and trying until he did it !of course , that does nt mean to get stuck with something that does not work , which takes me to the second reason why agree with the statement .2. i think successful people know when to change , or try a different approach .if something is not working , then know when to quit and try it in another way !do nt give up but do nt obsess either .maybe take a break and look it at a different angle .like the chemist who could not figure out the chemical composition of an element , and discovered it during a dream , when he dreamed of a snake biting its tail .3. life is constantly changing , and one can not stay the same without changing .new technologies are developed on a daily basis , and you can not lock yourself in a shell and pretending change is not happening outside .whether you like it or not , you have to try new things , or you ll stay behind .that s what successful people do .4. people fear that if they take risks they will loose the few things they have now .but they fail to realize that they are having a major loss with the cost of opportunity for not using your resources and take a risk .they would gain much more if they were willing to risk what they have or their time .5. also , in addition to these reasons , successful people know when to ask for help , and work in a team .one can acomplish more if one has support from other people .
