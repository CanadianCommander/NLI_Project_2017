i do agree with the statement that most advertisements do in fact make products seem much better than they really are .the reasons i think this is true are as follows .firstly , most advertisements always highlight positives of the product but do not mention any associated `` cons  of the product .although it is true that without stressing on positives , the product would not sell , but leaving out details do not give complete information about the product .for example , a macdonalds advertisement would highlight the `` experience at an afforable cost  but would not mention anything about the trans-fat content of the products which could have ill-effects on health of the consumer .secondly , advertisements use associations to sell a product and leads consumers to believe that acquisition of the product would materialize the association .for example , the `` air jordan  shoes marketed by nike sold the association of having the `` ability to play like michael jordan  using the air jordan shoes .we all know that it requires a lot more talent and ability than a pair of shoes to play like jordan .hence , the association always ends up glorifying the true benefit of the product .another reason that results in misplaced information about a product given the advertisement is the use of celebrity models in advertisements to sell products .even though the product might need a particular attribute in the customer ( for example a fit body ) to be beneficial to the customer , the customer does not sense that on seeing the advertisement .they rarely recognize that what looks good on supermodels like cindy crawford might not necessarily look good on them .given the above mentioned reasons , i would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
