most people are afraid to take risks or learn new things because they guess that it might fail .however , i believe that try new things and taking risks is what makes a person a successful person .it is good to have one thing that a person can do well .however , when he or she learns about a new thing , they can relate what they have learned to what they already know .in my school , our civics class do the chart called kwl chart .it s a chart listing what i already know , what i want to know , and what i have learned , which we filll out after the lesson .when i take the lesson with a basic knowledge that i already know to learn a new thing , i can relate them afterwards and also , infer factors about the topic .when someone only sticks to something that they know and how to do it , they will not succeed in society since they do not have broader knowledge than other people in the community .i strongly believe that taking risks is a best way to succeed .when people take risks and fail , they can fix what they ve done wrong , and get it right next time .for example , thomas alva edison had failed alot of times when inventing his light bulb , however , if kept on trying and finally made a light bulb that changed out lives .if he had stick to the job as a railroad worker and not put his job on risk for what he wants to do , he would nt be called `` the wizard of the menlo park .taking risks can also being sure of what someone is doing .if someone made decision , he or she should be proud of it and stick to it .for example , the famous chairman of the microsoft bill gates dropped out of college to start a new world that he wanted .he did not drop out because he could not follow the courses , but he dropped out because he was sure that he could make this world different .and by sticking to the decision he made and working hard to achieve his goal , he became successful and got what he wanted to get .even though he had the risk of not getting a successful job if he failed , but he came out successful because he stick to the decision he made .if he just stayed in school like a normal student , our life would nt been very modernized as today .being successful is what moast people in the world aim for .however , i believe that trying new things and taking risks makes a person successful such as bill gates and thomas edison rather than just doing only one thing that they are good at .
