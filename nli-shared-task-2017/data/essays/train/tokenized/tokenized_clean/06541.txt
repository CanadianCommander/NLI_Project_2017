i do nt agree with that statement .in my opinion , enjoying life does nt relate to the age directly .of course , usually a young person can make an advantage of his youthful and healthy body .he can do more extreme sport activities , like snowboarding , surfing or bumgee-jumping .but more often young people are not that independent as they wish to be .most young people need financial support from their parents , especially during the studying time at unversity .that means one has to explain the expediture exactly to the parents every time one needs money .that can be very exhausting and demotivating .after university , financial worries decrease on the one hand , but on the other hand concerns on the job arise .as a rule , the first years on the job are the most stressful ones which are accompanied by immense pressure to establish oneself in the new company .thus , i think that the thirty-somehows can enjoy life better than the younger people .those people usually have already gained acknowledgement in the job world and in society .moreover , they are financially independent and do nt have to fight for the career that intensly .as a result , that group of people can spend more time for their hobbys and their family .older people are also enjoying life , because they have more experience .i think they know how to appreciate the real things and values in life and are more confindent .
