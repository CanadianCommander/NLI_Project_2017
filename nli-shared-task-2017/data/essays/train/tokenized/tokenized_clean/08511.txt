nowadays , education is one of the most important thing in our lifes .in schools , teachers teach students some concepts which are related to the course .however , in whole life , people use not only these concepts but also individual experiences .it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .i strongly disagree this statement .because , there are some facts which are more significiant than the ideas and concepts and only can learn from real life .first of all , concepts and ideas are crucial for our business lifes .however , we cant forget that facts are more vital than those .for instance , in schools , teachers teach us only the concept of lived phenomenas .in life the concept of something can not be helpful for people .visibility , in other terms , living the concept in real life is always more helpful and necessary than invisibility .secondly , people should learn the facts .when , they face a problem , they cant solve problem with concepts or ideas .they can solve problems only with their personal experiences .people s experiences  are developing and improving with lived problems or facts .for example , when i was in university , i had finance course .in this course , the proffessor taught us the principles of finance and cash management .i understood all of the principles .after this course in order to improve my finance ability , i went to the central bank of rebuplic of turkey in order to make an internship in banking and financial institutions department which is based on financial transactions .first days of my internship , i cant implement the concepts and ideas which i learnt from university .however , from day to day , i started to learn the facts about financial transactions and because of realities , i became more successful at the end of my internship .consequently , in my opinion , it is more significiant for people or students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concepts .visibility is more crucial than invisibility .because , we live in real world .thus , only real facts and real experiences can help us in this challenging world !
