the issue about whether understanding ideas is more important than learning facts is a complex one .personally , i am convinced that facts are less important than ideas .in the following paragraphs i will try to explain the reason why i believe this .first , understanding ideas is more difficult than merely memorizing facts .even a little child can memorize dates , names of famous battles , names of kings etc .but it takes much more effort to understand the ideas and the implications behind these facts .take for example the french revolution .anyone can memorize the year : 1789 .but understanding the far-reaching outcome of it is a much more complex issue !the french revolution s results can still be observed in the world we are living right now , where governments rely on democracy rather than monarchy .while remembering a date is something anyone could do , performing a profound analysis on the plethora of causes and the multitude of effects of such an important event is not so easy .the second point i would like to stress is that learning facts is not so useful in everyday life as it is understanding concepts .what i mean by this is : what is the point of learning the exact year of a battle or the death of an important person ?it might only come useful when being on a tv quiz show or when playing `` trivial pursuit  .instead , delving into the causes , the effects and the main idea behind it , can prove useful .understanding the main idea that lies behind a fact can help someone obtain precious insight on very important issues like , for example , human nature .many antropological studies in fact , rely on histrorical events when trying to explain human behaviour .to summarize , i believe that ideas are more relevant than facts when it comes to studies and that the universities should be more focused on having students understanding ideas and concepts behind a fact , rather that the fact itself .
