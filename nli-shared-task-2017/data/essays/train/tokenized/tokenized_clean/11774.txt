in this modern world people are more concerned about their travel to different location .so , people should make their transport .eveyone are busy in this world so one has to make their own transport to reach their detinations .this can be done by owning a car .i diagree withe the statement that there will be fewer use of cars .this can be stated by following reasons .when destination is too long we need to take car to go on .we can not travel all time in buses or trains .furthermore , we need to take bus passes or bus tickets when ever we would go htrough buses .this would become messup to purchase evryday ticket .let us consider an example , if any peson is ill in our family i.e in critical condition we need to take him to hospital quickly .this can be done by having a car in our homes .if we have car in our homes we acn quickly take him to hospital .we can not take him in any other means of transport .this would take his life .cars are neccessary in modern world .if going to any place in car automatically it reflects our status .so , one would like to travel in car throughout his life .we cant travel every day in buses which are overcrowded or which may or may not come in proper timing , which may cause delay by stopping at every bustop .evenmore , if we need to go to different street we where the bus is not provided then we must walk .if we have car we can directly goto the particular place where we decide to go .in twenty years there may be any kind of tansport may introduced but this can not take to the destination which we want .if fuel prices go high then we can use electric cars which are recently introduced .in this way we can reduce our economy .we can be safe from traffic and pollution if we go by cars .we wont be effected much like when we travel through other means of transport .so there there would be heavy use of cars even after twenty years .therefore , car use will not become fewer at any time be it in twenty years , after twenty years or thiry years .
