there are lots of people who voice serios doubts about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and who are prepared to argue with specialization in one specific subject .but i would have to say that if i forced with the decision , my choice would probably be for specialization in one specific subject .in our world it is not easy to find a job in competitive job areas .there are lots of people who are able to make jobs in lots of areas , however , lots of companies prefer proffesional workers to improve their companies .in this kind of situations , people must have to develop themselves for one specific subject .if you want to earn lots of money , you must be a specialist in your job .it is impossible to b profecional in lots of jobs and being profecional your job is not impossible but it is not easy too .lots of people want to have ideas about variety of thing .they may be learn thing about lots of things bu it is not easy to have well knowledge in lots of jobs .people may be in a conflict in that kind of situations so they must be develop themselves in their own specialities .the technological developments have created a new world .with such of that technological movements , there is not any restrinction for development .if you have a broad knowledge in many areas it means that you know about lots of things but it does not mean that you are well about that kind of thing .for example , endustrial engineers have lots of knowledge about computer and electronic however many companies prefer to computer and electronic engineers in their jobs .all in all , from what has been discussed above we can safely draw the conclusion that people should specialize in one specific subject .becouse of the situations such as competitive job areas , importance of well knowledge and impossibilty of the broad knowledge of many areas , we should have to develop us in one specific subject profecionally .
