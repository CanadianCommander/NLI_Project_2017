i agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are  .if you pick advertising in health care products like over the counter medications doesnt work up to the extent they advertise or print on the item itself .for example there are certain medications used for hair growth like minoxidil which doesnt help in hair growth as they advertise .there is only one priscription medication for hair growth that is propecia even that will help only up seventy five percent .there are certain homeopathic medications like aerborn there is no exact theory how they work for all kind of symptoms they list like cold , cough , and more .they always advertise for certain over the counter medications they are as good as priscription drugs for example advil , its not exactly same strenth as priscrition it lesser strenth then how can be better than a priscription medication .in the advertisements they mention the advatages in big letters and disadvantages in very small letters , which are equally important and right to know for a consumer .by doing such kind of things and increasing their sales companys are making lot of profits .there is another disadvatage of advertising it also increases the manufacturing cost of the products , which eventually charged to the consumer .they advertising five uses of the product out of which one or two is correct .in the past two decades advertising is playing a mazor role in selling new products .some advertisements are really good and the best way to know a consumer about the new products in the market and their uses , provided they give us right information through advertising .my personal opinion on advertising is i could only realy upto certain extent and you have to be very careful
